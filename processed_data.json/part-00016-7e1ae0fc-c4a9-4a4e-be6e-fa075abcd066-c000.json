The show premiered on [[WUCW|KTMA-TV]] (now [[WUCW]]) in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], on November 24, 1988. It then moved to nationwide broadcast, first on [[The Comedy Channel (American TV channel)|The Comedy Channel]]/[[Comedy Central]] for seven seasons until its cancellation in 1996. Thereafter, it was picked up by [[Syfy|The Sci-Fi Channel]] and aired for three more seasons until another cancellation in August 1999.<ref>{{cite magazine| url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991778,00.html| title = Mystery Science Theater 3000|magazine=Time| date = August 16, 1999| last1 = Corliss| first1 = Richard}}</ref> A 60-episode [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] package titled ''The Mystery Science Theater Hour'' was produced in 1993 and broadcast on Comedy Central and syndicated to TV stations in 1995. In 2015, Hodgson led a [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] revival of the series with 14 episodes in its eleventh season, first released on [[Netflix]] on April 14, 2017, with another six-episode season following on November 22, 2018. A second successful crowdfunding effort in 2021 produced 13 additional episodes shown on the Gizmoplex, an online platform that Hodgson developed which launched in March 2022. {{As of|2023}}, [[List of Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes|230 episodes]] and a [[Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie|feature film]] have been produced as well as three live tours.\n\nThe show initially starred Hodgson as [[Joel Robinson]], a [[janitor]] trapped by two [[mad scientist]]s (\"The Mads\") on the Earth-orbiting ''Satellite of Love'', and forced to watch a series of [[B movie]]s to monitor his reaction to them. To keep his sanity, Joel crafts sentient robot companions, including [[Tom Servo]], [[Crow T. Robot]], and [[Gypsy (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Gypsy]], to keep him company and help him humorously comment on each movie as it plays, a process known as riffing. Each two-hour episode would feature a single movie (often edited for time constraints), sometimes preceded by various old [[short film|shorts]] and [[educational film]]s, with Joel, Tom, and Crow watching in [[silhouette]] from a row of theater seats at the bottom of the screen. These \"theater segments\" were framed with interstitial sketches called \"host segments\". The show's cast changed over its duration; most notably, the character of Joel was replaced by [[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike Nelson]] (played by [[Michael J. Nelson]]) halfway through the show's fifth season. Other cast members, most of whom were also writers for the show, include [[Trace Beaulieu]], [[J. Elvis Weinstein|Josh Weinstein]], [[Jim Mallon]], [[Kevin Murphy (actor)|Kevin Murphy]], [[Frank Conniff]], [[Mary Jo Pehl]], [[Bill Corbett]], [[Paul Chaplin]], and [[Bridget Jones Nelson]]. The 2017 revival features a primarily new cast, including [[Jonah Ray]] who plays the new human test subject [[Jonah Heston]], along with [[Felicia Day]] and [[Patton Oswalt]] as \"The Mads\" and [[Baron Vaughn]], [[Hampton Yount]], and Rebecca Hanson voicing Tom Servo, Crow T. Robot, and Gypsy, respectively. Season 13 brings back this cast while integrating Emily Connor, played by Emily Marsh, and others from the live tours in this era.\n\n''MST3K''{{'}}s original run did not garner high viewership numbers. However, the show's popularity spread through online word-of-mouth by its fans known as \"MSTies\" or \"Mysties\" (who would remind others to \"Keep circulating the tapes\"), frequent repeats, syndication, and home media offerings produced by [[Rhino Entertainment]]. Currently, this popularity continues through [[Shout! Factory]], who along with Hodgson, now own the rights to the show and supported the revived series. ''MST3K'' was listed as one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's \"100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME\" in 2007, and ''[[TV Guide]]'' has noted ''MST3K'' as one of the top [[cult television]] shows. The show won a [[Peabody Award]] in 1993,<ref name=\"The Peabody Awards\">{{cite web| url = http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/mystery-science-theater-3000|title=Mystery Science Theater 3000|website = The Peabody Awards}}</ref> was also nominated for two [[Emmy Awards]] in 1994 and 1995, and for the [[CableACE Award]] from 1992 to 1997. The show was considered highly influential, contributing towards the practice of [[social television]], and former cast members launched similar projects based on the riffing of films, including [[The Film Crew]], [[RiffTrax]], and [[Cinematic Titanic]]. ''MST3K'' also brought to light several older movies that had fallen into obscurity or had received little or no public attention when originally released. Many of these films were subsequently identified as [[List of films considered the worst|among the worst movies ever made]], most notably ''[[Manos: The Hands of Fate]]''.\n\n==Premise==\n{{See also|List of Mystery Science Theater 3000 characters}}\nWhile the cast of ''MST3K'' changed throughout its history, the basic premise of the show remains consistent: a human test subject—first [[Joel Robinson]] ([[Joel Hodgson]]), then [[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike Nelson]] ([[Michael J. Nelson]]), and most recently [[Jonah Heston]] ([[Jonah Ray]]) and Emily Connor (Emily Marsh)—has been imprisoned aboard the spacecraft ''Satellite of Love'' by mad scientists (collectively called \"The Mads\") and is forced to watch a series of bad movies in order to find one that will drive the test subject insane.\n\nIn an attempt to keep his sanity, Joel built [[sentience|sentient]] robots (\"the bots\") from parts aboard the ''Satellite of Love'', and they subsequently remained aboard with Joel's successors as test subjects. The Bots include [[Tom Servo]], [[Crow T. Robot]], [[GPC (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|GPC]] (formerly Gypsy) who is in charge of satellite operations, and [[Cambot]], the silent recorder of the experiments. Crow and Servo join the human test subject in watching the film in the satellite's theater. To keep from going mad, the trio frequently comment and wisecrack during the movie, a process known as \"riffing\". At regular intervals throughout the movie, the hosts leave the theater and return to the bridge of the satellite to perform sketches (commonly called \"host segments\") that often satirize the film being watched.\n\n==Format==\nThe general format of an ''MST3K'' episode has remained the same throughout the series' run. Episodes are approximately 90 minutes in running time (excluding commercial breaks) and begin with a short introductory segment in which the human host and the 'bots interact with the Mads before being sent the movie. During Joel Hodgson and Jonah Ray's tenures as hosts (and for a brief period at the start of the Mike Nelson era), the hosts and the Mads engage in an \"invention exchange\" in which they each show off their latest inventions. Sirens and flashing lights (\"Movie Sign\") then signal the characters to enter the theater.\n\n[[File:Mrb5.jpg|thumb|left|An example of ''MST3K''{{'}}s \"Shadowramma\" effect used as the central motif for the show. Here, Tom Servo (left), Joel Robinson, and Crow T. Robot, in silhouette, are watching the short ''[[Mr. B Natural]]'' in the 1991 episode featuring ''[[War of the Colossal Beast]]'']]\n\nIn the theater, the human host and 'bots' Tom and Crow sit in a row of theater seats, shown in silhouette along the bottom of the screen, an approach Hodgson called \"Shadowramma\". The three then riff on the film (which is sometimes accompanied by one or more [[short film|shorts]]) as it plays for both them and the audience. Occasionally, the silhouette format is used as a source of humor, or as a means of creating unobtrusive [[censor bars]] for scenes containing nudity. The show transitions into and out of the theater via a \"door sequence\", a series of six doors that open or close as the camera (presumably Cambot) passes through them.\n\nAt regular intervals throughout the episode, the characters leave the theater and perform sketches, usually inspired by the events of the film or short being shown, frequently making use of original songs and [[prop comedy]]. Some sketches bring in new or recurring characters or other devices; the host would consult an external camera, \"Rocket Number Nine\", to show events happening outside the ''Satellite'', and the \"Hexfield Viewscreen\" would be used to communicate with other characters from the ship's bridge. At the end of each sketch, \"Movie Sign\" (a reference to the concept of [[Sandworm (Dune)|wormsign]] from [[Frank Herbert|Frank Herbert's]] classic sci-fi novel [[Dune (novel)|''Dune'']]) is triggered again, and the characters must re-enter the theater.\n\nDuring Hodgson's period on the show, the final sketch aboard the ''Satellite'' often included reading of fan mail from the \"MST3K Info Club\". Fan mail readings decreased during Mike Nelson's tenure as host, and were dropped entirely once the show moved onto the Sci-Fi Channel. The final sketch of an episode typically ends with the Mads, with the lead Mad asking their lackey to \"push the button\" to end the transmission, and transitioning to the credit sequence. After the credits, a humorous short clip from the featured film (or the accompanying short on occasion) is replayed as a \"stinger\" to end the episode.\n\nIn November 1993, a limited selection of episodes were repackaged into an hour-long show titled ''Mystery Science Theater Hour'', meant to be better suited for off-network [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. In these, the original episode was split into two parts, each about 45 minutes long, excluding commercials. New skits opening and ending each episode included Mike Nelson portraying television host [[Jack Perkins (reporter)|Jack Perkins]], in a parody of Perkins' ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' series, in mock flattery of the ''MST3K'' episode being shown.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2013/11/27/247520996/about-mystery-science-theater-a-bold-declaration-its-bold | title = About 'Mystery Science Theater,' A Bold Declaration.

Murphy also created the first doorway sequence and theater seat design. These initial episodes were recorded at the long since-defunct [[Paragon Cable]] studios and customer service center in [[Hopkins, Minnesota]]. On review, Hodgson found that of the robots, Beeper's design was not working well, and tried a quick modification by replacing its head with a toy gumball machine top, creating the basis of Tom Servo.<ref name=\"ign migizi\"/>\n\nMallon met with KTMA station manager Donald O'Conner the next month and managed to get signed up for thirteen episodes. Show production was generally done on a 24-hour cycle, starting with Mallon offering a few films from KTMA's library for the writers to select from.<ref name=\"wired history\"/>  Riffing in these episodes was [[ad-lib]]bed during taping using notes made during preliminary viewings of the selected film. Episodes from this era are noted for their low number of riffs - in some instances 15 minutes of the movie could be shown before the cast made any comments.<ref name=\"time madness\"/> The show had some slight alterations from the pilot — the set was lit differently, the robots (now Crow, Servo and Gypsy) joined Joel in the theater, and a new doorway countdown sequence between the host and theater segments was shot. The puppeteers worked personalities into their robots: Crow (Beaulieu) was considered a robotic [[Groucho Marx]], Tom Servo (Weinstein) as a \"smarmy AM radio DJ\", and Gypsy (Mallon) modeled after Mallon's mother who had a \"heart of gold\" but would become disoriented when confronted with a difficult task.<ref name=\"wired history\"/> The development of the show's theme song would lead to establishing elements for the show's ongoing premise, with Hodgson now portraying himself as the character Joel Robinson.<ref name=\"art of the title\"/>\n\n''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' premiered on KTMA at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1988, with its first episode, ''Invaders from the Deep'', followed by a second episode, ''Revenge of the Mysterons from Mars'' at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. The choice of running the premiere on Thanksgiving was by happenstance, as the station felt the show was ready to go at that point, according to Hodgson.<ref name=\"avclub turkey day\"/> Initially, the show's response was unknown, until Mallon set up a phone line for viewers to call in.<ref name=\"wired history\"/> Response was so great that the initial run of 13 episodes was extended to 21, with the show running to May 1989. Hodgson and Mallon negotiated to secure the rights for the show for themselves, creating [[Best Brains]], Inc., agreeing to split ownership of the idea equally.<ref name=\"wired history\"/> During this time a fan club was set up and the show held its first live show at Scott Hansen's Comedy Gallery in Minneapolis, to a crowd of over 600.\n\nDespite the show's success, the station's overall declining fortunes forced it to file for bankruptcy reorganization in July 1989.<ref name=\"paste 25eps\"/> At the same time, [[HBO]] was looking to build a stable of shows for their upcoming [[The Comedy Channel (American TV channel)|Comedy Channel]] cable network. HBO approached Best Brains and requested a sample of their material.<ref name=\"wired history\"/> Hodgson and Mallon provided a seven-minute demo reel, which led to the network greenlighting ''MST3K'' as one of the first two shows picked up by the new network. According to Art Bell, one of the creators of the Comedy Channel, ''MST3K''{{'}}s arrival helped the network to fill space that they had originally planned to use short clips of films and television shows that they could not license in time for launch.<ref>{{cite web | url  =https://wtop.com/entertainment/2020/12/creator-of-comedy-central-pens-new-memoir-as-great-stocking-stuffer/ | title = Comedy Central creator pens memoir about launching 24/7 cable network | first = Jason | last= Fraley | date = December 9, 2020 | accessdate = April 30, 2023 | work = [[WTOP-FM|WTOP]] }}</ref>\n\n===Comedy Channel and Comedy Central era (1989–1996)===\n[[File:The Brain That Wouldn't Die.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=16|''[[The Brain That Wouldn't Die]]'', a 1962 film mocked in season five]]\n\nThe Comedy Channel offered Best Brains $35,000 per episode but allowed Best Brains to retain the show's rights.<ref name=\"nytimes 2008\"/> Best Brains was also able to keep production local to Minnesota instead of the network's desire to film in New York City or Los Angeles, as it would have cost four times more per episode, according to Hodgson.<ref name=\"wapost finetv\"/> Best Brains established an office and warehouse space in [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota|Eden Prairie]] for filming.<ref name=\"wired history\"/><ref name=\"OC weekly\"/> With an expanded but still limited budget, they were able to hire more writers, including Mike Nelson, Mary Jo Pehl, and Frank Conniff, and build more expansive sets and robot puppets.<ref name=\"wired history\"/> They retained the characters of Dr. Forrester (Beaulieu) and Dr. Erhardt (Weinstein) from the KTMA era and crafted the larger narrative of each episode being an \"experiment\" they test on Joel.<ref name=\"time madness\"/> The show began its national run shortly after the Comedy Channel went on the air in November 1989.\n\n''MST3K'' was considered Comedy Channel's signature program, generating positive press about the show despite the limited availability of the cable channel nationwide.<ref name=\"wired history\"/> After the second season, The Comedy Channel and rival comedy cable network [[Ha! (TV channel)|HA!]] merged to become CTV: The Comedy Network (later changed to [[Comedy Central]]). During this period, ''MST3K'' became the newly merged cable channel's signature series, expanding from 13 to 24 episodes a year. To take advantage of the show's status, Comedy Central ran \"Turkey Day\", a 30-hour marathon of ''MST3K'' episodes during Thanksgiving 1991. The name of the event was not only inspired by the traditional turkey meal served on Thanksgiving, but also by use of \"Turkey\" from ''The Golden Turkey Awards'' to represent bad movies.<ref name=\"avclub turkey day\"/> This tradition would be continued through the rest of the Comedy Central era. Though the show did not draw large audience numbers compared to other programming on Comedy Central, such as reruns of ''Saturday Night Live'', the dedicated fans and attention kept the show on the network.<ref name=\"nytimes 2008\"/>\n\n''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie]]'' was produced during the later half of the Comedy Central era and had a very limited theatrical release in 1996 through [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Gramercy Pictures]]. It featured Mike and the bots subjected to the film ''[[This Island Earth]]'' by Dr. Forrester.

Conniff stated that he often would have to watch around twenty films in their entirety before selecting one to use for the show.<ref name=\"io9 sidehackers\"/> In one specific case, the second-season episode with the 1969 film ''[[The Sidehackers]]'', they had only skimmed the first part of the movie before making the decision to use it, and only later discovered that it contained a scene where a female character is brutally [[rape]]d and [[murder]]ed.

Some licensing required buying film rights in packages, with the selected bad movies included in a catalog of otherwise good films, making the negotiations odd since the network was only interested in the bad film. Other times, the rights to the film were poorly documented, and the network would follow the chain of custody to locate the copyright owner so as to secure broadcast rights.<ref name=\"wired history\"/>\n\nIn contrast to the ad-libbing of riffs from KTMA, the riffs were scripted ahead of time by the writers.<ref name=\"wired history\"/><ref name=\"time madness\"/> An average episode (approximately 90 minutes running time) would contain more than 600 such riffs,<ref name=\"time madness\">{{cite magazine | url = http://entertainment.time.com/2010/08/28/mystery-science-theater-2010-riffer-madness/ | title = Mystery Science Theater 2010: Riffer Madness! | first = Richard | last = Corlis | date = August 28, 2010 | access-date = December 2, 2015 | magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref> and some with upwards of 800 riffs.<ref name=\"usatoday 25th\"/> Riffs were developed with the entire writing staff watching the film together several times through, giving off-the-cuff quips and jokes as the film went along, or identifying where additional material would be helpful for the comedy.

Two separate projects were launched that specifically borrowed on the theme of riffing on bad movies. After the short-lived ''[[The Film Crew]]'' in 2006, Nelson started RiffTrax, providing downloadable audio files containing ''MST3K''-style riffs that the viewer can synchronize to their personal copy of a given popular movie (such as ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|Star Wars: Episode I]]''); this was done to avoid copyright and licensing issues with such films. RiffTrax{{'}}s cast expanded to include Murphy and Corbett along with occasional guest stars, and are able to use a wider range of films, including films and shorts in the public domain, and films for which they could get the license to distribute digitally and, sometimes, on DVD/Blu-ray. In addition, they launched production of ''RiffTrax Live'' shows for various films, where they perform their riffing in front of a live audience that is simultaneously broadcast to other movie theaters across the country and later made available as on-demand video. {{As of|2018}}, RiffTrax continues to offer new material and shows.<ref name=\"thr 2018\"/> As part of a tribute to their roots, RiffTrax has performed some works that previously appeared on ''MST3K'', including ''Manos: the Hands of Fate'', ''[[Santa Claus (1959 film)|Santa Claus]]'', and ''Time Chasers''.\n\nSimilarly, Hodgson, after some experimental creative works such as ''[[The TV Wheel]]'',<ref name=\"wired history\"/> started ''[[Cinematic Titanic]]'' with Beaulieu, Weinstein, Conniff, and Pehl in 2007. Like ''MST3K'', the five riffed on movies for which they were able to acquire the licenses (including ''Santa Claus Conquers the Martians''), which then were distributed on DVD and, later, through on-demand video and streaming options. They later did a number of live shows across the United States, most of which were made available on DVD and digitally.\n\nIn 2015, Trace Beaulieu and Frank Conniff began performing together as \"The Mads\", riffing movies at live screenings across the U.S. Many of their stops included two nights of movies with a separate riff writing class the morning of the second film.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.themadsareback.com| title = The Mads Are Back » The Mads are back!
