It uses active transmit-receive radar guidance instead of semi-active receive-only radar guidance. It is a [[fire-and-forget]] weapon, unlike the previous generation [[AIM-7 Sparrow|Sparrow]] missiles which required full guidance from the firing aircraft.

With an effective range of about {{convert|12|mi|km}}, it was introduced as a radar [[beam riding|beam-riding]] missile and then it was improved to a [[semi-active radar homing|semi-active radar guided]] missile which would home in on reflections from a target illuminated by the radar of the launching aircraft. It was effective at visual to beyond visual range. The early beam riding versions of the Sparrow missiles were integrated onto the [[McDonnell F3H Demon]] and [[Vought F7U Cutlass]], but the definitive AIM-7 Sparrow was the primary weapon for the all-weather [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]] fighter/interceptor, which lacked an internal gun in its [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and early [[U.S. Air Force]] versions. The F-4 carried up to four AIM-7s in built-in recesses under its belly.\n\nDesigned for use against non-maneuvering targets such as bombers, the missiles initially performed poorly against fighters over North Vietnam, and were progressively improved until they proved highly effective in dogfights. Together with the short-range, infrared-guided [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]], they replaced the [[AIM-4 Falcon]] IR and radar guided series for use in air combat by the USAF as well. A disadvantage to semi-active homing was that only one target could be illuminated by the launching [[fighter plane]] at a time. Also, the launching aircraft had to remain pointed in the direction of the target (within the azimuth and elevation of its own radar set) which could be difficult or dangerous in [[air-to-air combat]].\n\nAn active-radar variant called the Sparrow II was developed to address these drawbacks, but the U.S. Navy pulled out of the project in 1956.  The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], which took over development in the hopes of using the missile to arm their prospective [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]] interceptor, soon followed in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-7.html|title=Raytheon AIM/RIM-7 Sparrow|work=designation-systems.net|access-date=April 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202152/http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-7.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>  The electronics of the time simply could not be miniaturized enough to make Sparrow II a viable working weapon.  It would take decades, and a new generation of digital electronics, to produce an effective active-radar air-to-air missile as compact as the Sparrow.\n\n===AIM-54 Phoenix LRM===\nThe US Navy later developed the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] long-range missile (LRM) for the fleet air defense mission. It was a large {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, Mach 5 missile designed to counter [[cruise missile]]s and the bombers that launched them. Originally intended for the straight-wing [[Douglas F6D Missileer]] and then the navalized [[General Dynamics–Grumman F-111B]], it finally saw service with the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], the only fighter capable of carrying such a heavy missile. The Phoenix was the first US [[fire-and-forget]], multiple-launch, radar-guided missile: one which used its own active guidance system to guide itself without help from the launch aircraft when it closed on its target. This, in theory, gave a Tomcat with a six-Phoenix load the unprecedented capability of tracking and destroying up to six targets beyond visual range, as far as {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} away—the only US fighter with such capability.\n\nA full load of six Phoenix missiles and its {{convert|2000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} dedicated launcher exceeded a typical Vietnam-era bomb load. Its service in the US Navy was primarily as a deterrent, as its use was hampered by restrictive [[rules of engagement]] in conflicts such as [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]], [[Operation Southern Watch|Southern Watch]] (enforcing no-fly zones), and [[Iraq War]]. The US Navy retired the Phoenix in 2004<ref>{{Citation | title = Navy Retires AIM-54 Phoenix Missile | url = http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=15422 | place = United States | publisher = Navy | access-date = November 26, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110305105351/http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=15422 | archive-date = March 5, 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref> in light of availability of the AIM-120 AMRAAM on the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] and the pending retirement of the F-14 Tomcat from active service in late 2006.\n\n===ACEVAL/AIMVAL===\nThe [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] conducted an extensive evaluation of air combat tactics and missile technology from 1974 to 1978 at [[Nellis AFB]] using the F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle equipped with Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles as the blue force and aggressor F-5E aircraft equipped with [[AIM-9L]] [[all-aspect]] Sidewinders as the red force. This [[joint test and evaluation]] (JT&E) was designated [[ACEVAL/AIMVAL|Air Combat Evaluation/Air Intercept Missile Evaluation]] (ACEVAL/AIMVAL).{{citation needed| date= July 2010| reason= Dead link removed}} A principal finding was that the necessity to produce illumination for the Sparrow until impact resulted in the red force's being able to launch their all-aspect Sidewinders before impact, resulting in mutual kills. What was needed was Phoenix-type multiple-launch and terminal active capability in a Sparrow-size airframe. This led to a [[memorandum of agreement]] (MOA) with European allies (principally the UK and Germany for development) for the US to develop an advanced, medium-range, air-to-air missile with the USAF as lead service. The MOA also assigned responsibility for development of an advanced, short-range, air-to-air missile to the European team; this would become the British [[ASRAAM]].\n\n===Requirements===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2022}}\nBy the 1990s, the reliability of the Sparrow had improved so much from the dismal days of Vietnam that it accounted for the largest number of aerial targets destroyed in the Desert Storm part of the Gulf War. But while the USAF had passed on the Phoenix and its own similar [[AIM-47 Falcon]]/[[Lockheed YF-12]] to optimize dogfight performance, it still needed a multiple-launch fire-and-forget capability for the F-15 and F-16. The AMRAAM would need to be fitted on fighters as small as the F-16, and fit in the same spaces that were designed to fit the Sparrow on the F-4 Phantom. The European partners needed AMRAAM to be integrated on aircraft as small as the [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|BAe Sea Harrier]]. The US Navy needed the AMRAAM to be carried on the F/A-18 Hornet and wanted capability for two to be carried on a launcher that normally carried one Sparrow to allow for more air-to-ground weapons. Finally, the AMRAAM became one of the primary air-to-air weapons of the new [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]] fighter, which needed to place all of its weapons into internal weapons bays in order to help achieve an extremely low [[radar cross-section]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:AIM-120 first kill.jpg|thumb|right|First successful test at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico 1982]]\n\nAMRAAM was developed as the result of an agreement (the [[Family of Weapons]] MOA, no longer in effect by 1990), among the United States and several other [[NATO]] nations to develop air-to-air missiles and to share production technology. Under this agreement, the U.S. was to develop the next generation medium range missile (AMRAAM) and Europe would develop the next generation short range missile (ASRAAM). Although Europe initially adopted the AMRAAM, an effort to develop the [[Meteor (missile)|MDBA Meteor]], a competitor to AMRAAM, was begun in UK. Eventually, the ASRAAM was developed solely by the British, but using another source for its infrared seeker. After protracted development, the deployment of AMRAAM (AIM-120A) began in September 1991 in US Air Force [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]] fighter [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s. The US Navy soon followed (in 1993) in its [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] squadrons.\n\nThe [[Russian Air Force]] counterpart of AMRAAM is the somewhat similar [[R-77]] (NATO codename AA-12 Adder), sometimes referred to in the West as the \"AMRAAMski\". Likewise, France began its own air-to-air missile development with the [[MICA (missile)|MICA]] concept that used a common airframe for separate radar-guided and infrared-guided versions.\n\n==Operational history==\n===United States===\nThe AMRAAM was used for the first time on December 27, 1992, when a USAF [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|General Dynamics F-16D Fighting Falcon]] shot down an Iraqi [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]] that violated the southern no-fly-zone.<ref>Bjorkman, Eileen, \"Small, fast and in your face\", ''Air & Space'', February/March 2014, p. 35.</ref> This missile had been returned from the flight line as defective a day earlier. The AMRAAM gained a second victory in January 1993 when an Iraqi [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]] was shot down by a USAF F-16C.\n\nOn 28 February 1994, a [[Republika Srpska Air Force]] [[Soko J-21 Jastreb|J-21 Jastreb]] aircraft was shot down by a USAF F-16C that was patrolling the UN-imposed no-fly zone over [[Bosnia]]. In that engagement, at least three other Serbian aircraft were shot down by USAF F-16Cs using [[AIM-9]] missiles ([[Banja Luka incident]]). At that point, three launches in combat had resulted in three kills, resulting in the AMRAAM's being informally named \"slammer\" in the second half of the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1994, two [[USAF]] F-15 fighters patrolling Iraq's Northern No-Fly Zone mistook a pair of US Army Black Hawk helicopters for Iraqi helicopters, and [[1994 Black Hawk shootdown incident|shot them down]]. One was downed with an AIM-120, and one with an AIM-9 Sidewinder.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/world/us-jets-over-iraq-attack-own-helicopters-in-error-all-26-on-board-are-killed.html |title=U.S. Jets Over Iraq Attack Own Helicopters in Error; All 26 on Board Are Killed |last=R.

During spring 1999, AMRAAMs saw their main combat action during [[Operation Allied Force]], the Kosovo [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|bombing campaign]]. Six Serbian MiG-29s were shot down by NATO (four USAF F-15Cs, one USAF F-16C, and one Dutch F-16A MLU), all of them using AIM-120 missiles (the supposed kill by the F-16C may have actually been friendly fire, a man-portable [[SA-7]] fired by Serbian infantry).<ref name=\"ausairpower.net\">{{cite web |author=Air Power Australia |url=http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-BVR-AAM.html |title=Air Power Australia: Technical Report APA-TR-2008-0301 |pages=1 |publisher=Ausairpower.net |access-date=April 12, 2012 |date=2008-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430182655/http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-BVR-AAM.html |archive-date=April 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn 18 June 2017, a US [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornet]] engaged and [[Ja'Din shootdown incident|shot down]] a [[Sukhoi Su-22]] of the [[Syrian Air Force]] over northern Syria,<ref name=\"auto\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40322666 \"US coalition downs first Syria government jet.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930211844/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40322666|date=September 30, 2018}} Retrieved 19 June 2017.</ref> using an AIM-120.

It improves the aerial combat capabilities of US and allied aircraft to meet the threat of enemy air-to-air weapons as they existed in 1991. AMRAAM serves as a follow-on to the AIM-7 Sparrow missile series. The new missile is faster, smaller, and lighter, and has improved capabilities against low-altitude targets. It also incorporates a datalink to guide the missile to a point where its active radar turns on and makes terminal intercept of the target. An inertial reference unit and micro-computer system makes the missile less dependent upon the fire-control system of the aircraft.\n\nOnce the missile closes in on the target, its [[active radar]] guides it to intercept. This feature, known as \"fire-and-forget\", frees the aircrew from the need to further provide guidance, enabling the aircrew to aim and fire several missiles simultaneously at multiple targets and break a radar lock after the missile seeker goes active and guide themselves to the targets.\n\nThe missile also features the ability to \"Home on Jamming,\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/aim-120.htm | title = Military Analysis Network: AIM-120 AMRAAM Slammer | date = April 14, 2000 | publisher = FAS | access-date = April 12, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110316035752/http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/aim-120.htm | archive-date = March 16, 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref> giving it the ability to switch over from active radar homing to passive homing – homing on jamming signals from the target aircraft. Software on board the missile allows it to detect if it is being jammed, and guide on its target using the proper guidance system.\n\n==Guidance system overview==\n {{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Interception course stage===\n[[File:F-14 carrying AMRAAM.jpg|thumb|[[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] carrying an AMRAAM during a 1982 test]]\n\nAMRAAM uses two-stage [[missile guidance|guidance]] when fired at long range.\n\nThe aircraft passes data to the missile just before launch, giving it information about the location of the target aircraft from the launch point, including its direction and speed. This information is generally obtained using the launching aircraft's radar, although it could come from an [[infrared search and track]] system, from another fighter aircraft via a [[Joint Tactical Information Distribution System|data link]], or from an [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] aircraft. Using its built-in [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), the missile uses the information provided pre-launch to fly on an interception course toward the target.\n\nAfter launch, if the firing aircraft or surrogate continues to track the target, periodic updates, e.g. changes in the target's direction and speed, are sent from the launch aircraft to the missile, allowing the missile to adjust its course, via actuation of the rear fins, so that it is able to close to a self-homing distance where it will be close enough to \"catch\" the target aircraft in the ''basket'' (the missile's radar field of view in which it will be able to lock onto the target aircraft, unassisted by the launch aircraft).\n\nNot all armed services using the AMRAAM have elected to purchase the mid-course update option, which limits AMRAAM's effectiveness in some scenarios. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] initially opted not to use mid-course update for its [[Panavia Tornado ADV|Tornado F3]] force, only to discover that without it, testing proved the AMRAAM was less effective in beyond visual range (BVR) engagements than the older [[semi-active radar homing]] [[Skyflash|BAE Skyflash]] (a development of the Sparrow), since the AIM-120's own radar is necessarily of lesser range and power as compared to that of the launch aircraft.\n\n===Terminal stage and impact===\nOnce the missile closes to self-homing distance, it turns on its active radar seeker and searches for the target aircraft. If the target is in or near the expected location, the missile will find it and guide itself to the target from this point. If the missile is fired at short range, within visual range (WVR) or the near BVR, it can use its active seeker just after launch to guide it to intercept.<ref>{{cite web |title=AIM-120 AMRAAM |url=https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104576/aim-120-amraam/ |website=U.S. Air Force |publisher=U.S. Air Force |language=en |date=April 1, 2003 |access-date=May 28, 2020 |archive-date=July 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725004845/https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104576/aim-120-amraam/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Boresight Visual mode===\nApart from the radar-slaved mode, there is a free guidance mode, called \"Visual\". This mode is host-aircraft radar guidance-free—the missile just fires and locks onto the first thing it sees. This mode can be used for defensive shots, i.e. when the enemy has numerical superiority. {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Variants and upgrades==\n[[File:20180328 AIM-120 Udvar-Hazy.jpg|thumb|An AIM-120 AMRAAM missile on display at the U.S. National Air and Space Museum]]\n[[File:F-22 GBU39B AIM-120 m02006120800117.jpg|thumb|right|AIM-120 AMRAAM (right) fitted in a weapons bay of a [[F-22 Raptor]]]]\n\n===Air-to-air missile versions===\nThere are currently four main variants of AMRAAM, all in service with the [[United States Air Force]], [[United States Navy]], and the United States Marine Corps. The '''AIM-120A''' is no longer in production and shares the enlarged wings and fins with the successor {{anchor|AIM-120B|B}}'''AIM-120B'''. The AIM-120C has smaller \"clipped\" aerosurfaces to enable internal carriage on the USAF F-22 Raptor. AIM-120B deliveries began in 1994.\n\nThe {{anchor|AIM-120C|C}}'''AIM-120C''' deliveries began in 1996. The C-variant has been steadily upgraded since it was introduced. The AIM-120C-6 contained an improved fuze (Target Detection Device) compared to its predecessor. The AIM-120C-7 development began in 1998 and included improvements in homing and greater range (actual amount of improvement unspecified). It was successfully tested in 2003 and is currently being produced for both domestic and foreign customers.

A direct-view [[Night vision device|night-vision telescope]] was installed in the forward door, an early [[forward-looking infrared]] device was placed in the forward part of the left wheel well, with miniguns and rotary cannons fixed facing down and aft along the left side.

It is capable of delivering precision firepower or area-saturation fire over a target area over a long period of time, at night, or in adverse weather. The sensor suite consists of an electro-optical image sensor, [[infrared]] sensor, and [[radar]]. These sensors allow the gunship to visually or electronically identify friendly ground forces and targets in most weather conditions.\n\nThe AC-130U is equipped with the [[AN/APQ-180]], a [[synthetic aperture radar]], for long-range target detection and identification. The gunship's navigational devices include [[inertial navigation system]]s and a [[global positioning system]]. The AC-130U employs technologies developed in the 1990s, which allow it to attack two targets simultaneously.

The Black Crow system was [[master/slave (technology)|slaved]] into the targeting computers of the AC-130A/E/H, enabling the detection of the unshielded [[ignition coil]]s of North Vietnamese trucks hidden under dense jungle foliage along the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. It could also detect hand-held transmitter signals of air controllers on the ground to identify and locate targets.\n\nThe PGM-38/U enhanced 25&nbsp;mm [[high-explosive incendiary]] round was created to expand the AC-130U gunships' mission in standoff range and survivability for its 25&nbsp;mm [[GAU-12 Equalizer|GAU-12/U]] gun. This round is a combination of the existing PGU-25 HEI and a M758 fuze designated as FMU-151/B to meet the MIL-STD-1316.

In June 1968, AC-130s were deployed to [[Tan Son Nhut]] AB near Saigon for support against the [[Tet Offensive]]. By 30 October 1968, enough AC-130 Gunship IIs arrived to form a squadron, the [[16th Special Operations Squadron]] of the [[8th Tactical Fighter Wing]], at [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base]], Thailand. At this time, the C-130A gunship was designated the AC-130A.\n\nOn 18 August 1968, an AC-130 gunship flying an armed reconnaissance mission in Vietnam's III Corps was diverted to support the [[Katum Camp|Katum Special Forces Camp]]. The ground commander quickly assessed the accurate fire and capabilities of this weapons system and called for fire on his own perimeter when the Viet Cong attempted to bridge the wire on the west side of his position.\n\nBy December 1968, most AC-130s flew under [[F-4 Phantom II]] escort (to protect the gunship against heavy and concentrated antiaircraft fire) from the 497th Tactical Fighter Squadron, normally three Phantoms per gunship. On 24 May 1969, the first Spectre gunship was lost to enemy fire.<ref name=Hobson_Losses>{{Citation |page= 268 |last= Hobson |first= Chris |title= Vietnam Air Losses: United States Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps Fixed-Wing Aircraft Losses in Southeast Asia, 1961–1973 |place= Hinckley, England, United Kingdom |publisher= Midland |year= 2001 |isbn= 1-85780-115-6}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1969, under code name \"Surprise Package\", 56-0490 arrived with solid-state, laser-illuminated, low light-level TV with a companion YAG [[laser designator]], an improved forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor, video recording for TV and FLIR, an [[inertial navigation system]], and a prototype digital fire-control computer. The remaining AC-130s were refitted with upgraded similar equipment in the summer of 1970, and then redeployed to Ubon RTAFB. On 25 October 1971, the first \"Cadillac\" gunship, the AC-130E, arrived in Vietnam. On 17 February 1972, the first 105&nbsp;mm cannon arrived for service with Spectre and was installed on Gunship 570. It was used from mid-February until the aircraft received battle damage to its right flap. The cannon was switched to Gunship 571 and was used until 30 March when the aircraft was shot down.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of AC-130 Spectre gunships lost in the Vietnam War 1969–1972\n!Date!!Gunship model!!Unit!!Cause of loss / remarks\n|-\n|24 May 1969\n|AC-130A\n|16th Special Operations Squadron\n|Downed by 37&nbsp;mm [[anti-aircraft artillery]] (AA) at {{cvt|6,500|ft|m}} while on [[reconnaissance]] for enemy trucks<ref>Hobson p. 182.</ref>\n|-\n|22 April 1970\n|AC-130A\n|16th SOS\n|Downed while truck hunting by 37&nbsp;mm AA<ref>Hobson p. 202.</ref>\n|-\n|28 March 1972\n|AC-130A\n|16th SOS\n|Downed while truck hunting along the Ho Chi Minh Trail by a [[SA-2]] [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM), [[nose art]] named ''Prometheus''<ref>Hobson p. 219.</ref>\n|-\n|30 March 1972\n|AC-130E\n|16th SOS\n|Downed while truck hunting by 57&nbsp;mm AA at {{cvt|7,500|ft|m}}: The \"E\" model was armed with a 105&nbsp;mm [[howitzer]].

Spectre was still needed and active in the region, supporting operations in Laos and Cambodia. On 22 February 1973, American offensive operations in Laos ended and the gunships became totally committed to operations in the Cambodian conflict.\n\nOn 12 April 1975, the [[Khmer Rouge]] was threatening the capital of [[Phnom Penh]] and AC-130s were called on to help in [[Operation Eagle Pull]], the final evacuation of American and allied officials from Phnom Penh before it was conquered by the communists. The AC-130 was also over Saigon on 30 April 1975 to protect the final evacuation in [[Operation Frequent Wind]]. Spectres were also called in when the [[Mayaguez incident|USS ''Mayaguez'']] was seized, on the open sea, by Khmer Rouge soldiers and sailors on 15 May 1975.\n\nSix AC-130s and 52 air crew members were lost during the war.<ref name=Hobson_Losses/> AC-130s reportedly destroyed more than 10,000 trucks<ref>{{Cite web |title=THE AC-130 GUNSHIP AND ITS VARIANTS Research from 10/2010 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/3A/3AC462D933EE22F4D8B4D32E19DDCF11_AC%20130%20research.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/3A/3AC462D933EE22F4D8B4D32E19DDCF11_AC%20130%20research.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live}}</ref> and participated in many crucial close-air-support missions in Vietnam.\n\n===Cold War and later action===\n[[File:AC-130A pylon turn.jpg|thumb|An AC-130A performs a left-hand pylon turn.]]\n\nWith the conclusion of hostilities in Southeast Asia in the mid-1970s, the AC-130H became the sole gunship in the regular Air Force, home based at Hurlburt Field, Florida, while the AC-130A fleet was transferred to the Air Force Reserve's 919th Tactical Airlift Group (919 TAG) at [[Eglin AFB]] Auxiliary Field #3/[[Duke Field]], Florida. With the transition to the AC-130A, the 919 TAG was then redesignated as the [[919th Special Operations Wing|919th Special Operations Group]].\n\nIn the late 1970s, when the AC-130H fleet was first being modified for in-flight refueling capability, a demonstration mission was planned and flown from Hurlburt Field, Florida, nonstop, to conduct a 2-hour live-fire mission over Empire Firing Range in the Republic of Panama, then return home. This 13-hour mission with two in-flight refuelings from [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]] tankers proved the validity of flying long-range missions outside the [[contiguous United States]] to attack targets then return to home base without intermediate stops.\n\nAC-130s from both the [[4th Special Operations Squadron|4th]] and [[16th Special Operations Squadron|16th]] Special Operations Squadrons have been deployed in nearly every conflict in which the United States has been involved, officially and unofficially, since the end of the Vietnam War.\n\nIn July 1979, AC-130H crews deployed to [[Howard Air Force Base]], Panama, as a precaution against possible hostile actions against American personnel during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. New time aloft and nonstop distance records were subsequently set by a 16th SOS two-ship AC-130H formation flight that departed Hurlburt Field on 13 November 1979 and landed on 15 November at [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[Guam]], a distance of {{convert |7200|nmi|km}} and 29 hours 43 minutes nonstop, refueling four times in-flight.<ref>Lockheed records.</ref><ref>{{Citation |type= news |first= Pilot Lt Col Jim |last= Lawrence |date=June 1995 |title= ?? |newspaper= Night Flyer|publisher= AFSOC }}</ref> Refueling support for the Guam deployment was provided by KC-135 crews from the 305th Air Refueling Wing from [[Grissom AFB]], Indiana.\n\nIn November 1979, four AC-130H gunships flew nonstop from Hurlburt Field to Anderson AFB, Guam, because of the [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage situation at the US Embassy in Iran]]. On Guam, AC-130H crews developed communications-out/lights-out refueling procedures for later employment by trial-and-error. This deployment with the 1 SOW/CC as task force commander was directed from the office of the CJCS for fear that Iranian militants could begin executing American Embassy personnel who had been [[Iran hostage crisis|taken hostage on 4 November]]. One early option considered AC-130H retaliatory punitive strikes deep within Iran. Later gunship flights exceeded the 1979 Hurlburt-to-Guam flight. Upon return in March 1980, the four planes soon found themselves in Egypt to support the [[Operation Eagle Claw|ill-fated hostage rescue attempt]].\n\n[[File:AC-130 gunship firing broadside at dusk.jpg|thumb|left|Smoke visible from [[rotary cannon]] during twilight operations in 1988]]\nDuring [[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]] in Grenada in 1983, AC-130s suppressed enemy air-defense systems and attacked ground forces enabling the assault of the [[Point Salines International Airport|Point Salines Airfield]] via [[airdrop]] and air-land of friendly forces. The AC-130 aircrew earned the [[William H. Tunner|Lieutenant General William H. Tunner]] Award for the mission.\n\nThe AC-130Hs of the [[16th Special Operations Squadron]] unit maintained an ongoing rotation to Howard AB, Panama, monitoring activities in El Salvador and other Central American points of interest, with rules of engagement eventually permitting attacks on [[FMLN]] targets.

AC-130s took part in [[Timeline of United States military operations#1991–1999|Operation Assured Response]] in Liberia in 1996 and in [[Operation Silver Wake]] in 1997, the evacuation of American [[non-combatants]] from [[Albania]].\n\nAC-130s took part in the [[NATO]] missions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Kosovo]] during the 1990s.\n\nThe AC-130U gunship set a new record for the longest sustained flight by any C-130 on 22 and 23 October 1997, when two AC-130U gunships flew 36 hours nonstop from Hurlburt Field to [[Taegu Air Base]] (Daegu), South Korea, being refueled seven times in the air by KC-135 tankers. The two gunships took on 410,000&nbsp;lb (186,000&nbsp;kg) of fuel. Gunships also were part of the buildup of US forces in 1998 to compel Iraq to allow [[UNSCOM]] weapons inspections.\n\n===War on Terror===\n[[File:AC-130 Training.jpg|thumb|An AC-130U releasing [[Flare (countermeasure)|flares]]]]\n\nThe US has used gunships with deployments to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)|War in Afghanistan]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom#Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan|Operation Enduring Freedom]], [[Operation Freedom's Sentinel]]) (2001–2021), and [[Iraq War]] (Operation Iraqi Freedom) (2003–2011). AC-130 strikes were directed by special forces on known Taliban locations during the early days of the war in Afghanistan. US Special Operations Forces used the AC-130 to support its operations. The day after arriving in Afghanistan, the AC-130s attacked Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces near the city of Konduz and were directly responsible for the city's surrender the next day. On 26 November 2001, Spectres were called in to put down [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi|a rebellion]] at the prison fort of [[Qala-I-Janghi]]. The 16 SOS flew missions over Mazar-i-Sharif, [[History of Kunduz|Kunduz]], Kandahar, Shkin, Asadabad, Bagram, Baghran, Tora Bora, and virtually every other part of Afghanistan. The Spectre participated in countless operations within Afghanistan, performing on-call close air support and armed reconnaissance. In March 2002, three AC-130 Spectres provided 39 crucial combat missions in support of [[Operation Anaconda]] in Afghanistan. During the intense fighting, the planes fired more than 1,300 40&nbsp;mm and 1,200 105&nbsp;mm rounds.\n\nClose air support was the main mission of the AC-130 in Iraq. Night after night, at least one AC-130 was in the air to fulfill one or more air-support requests (ASRs). A typical mission had the AC–130 supporting a single brigade's ASRs followed by aerial refueling and another two hours with another brigade or SOF team. The use of AC-130s in places like Fallujah, urban settings where insurgents were among crowded populations of non-combatants, was criticized by human rights groups. AC-130s were also used for intelligence gathering with their sophisticated long-range video, infrared and radar sensors. In 2007, US Special Operations forces also used the AC-130 in attacks on suspected [[Al-Qaeda]] militants in Somalia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/01/08/somalia.strike/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070813055357/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/01/08/somalia.strike/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 August 2007 |title=Pentagon official: US attacks al Qaeda suspects in Somalia |publisher=CNN |date=8 January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6296971.stm |title=US plane 'bombed Somalia targets' |work=Africa News |publisher=BBC |access-date=25 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306171925/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6296971.stm |archive-date=6 March 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEight AC-130H and 17 AC-130U aircraft were in active-duty service as of July 2010.<ref name=\"AC-130HU_factsht 2009\" /> In March 2011, the Air Force deployed two AC-130U gunships to take part in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]], the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|US military intervention in Libya]],<ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-28/coalition-isn-t-coordinating-strikes-with-rebels-u-s-says-1-.html |title=Coalition Isn't Coordinating Strikes With Rebels, US Says |first=Brendan |last=McGarry |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=28 March 2011 |access-date=8 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009190819/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-28/coalition-isn-t-coordinating-strikes-with-rebels-u-s-says-1-.html |archive-date=9 October 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> which eventually came under NATO as [[Operation Unified Protector]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/us/29military.html |title=US Gives Its Air Power Expansive Role in Libya |last=Schmitt |first=Eric |date=29 March 2011 |work=The New York Times |page=A13 |access-date=29 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401145709/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/us/29military.html |archive-date=1 April 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<!--American Heroes Channel is part of Military Channel, part of Discovery-->\nBy September 2013, 14 MC-130W Dragon Spear aircraft have been converted to AC-130W Stinger II gunships.

The aircraft participated in the Vietnam War and the [[Mayaguez incident|rescue]] of the [[SS Mayaguez]]. ''Ultimate End'' demonstrated the durability of the C-130 after surviving hits in five places by 37&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft artillery on 12 December 1970, extensive left wing leading edge damage on 12 April 1971 and a 57&nbsp;mm round damaging the belly and injuring one crewman on 4 March 1972. \"Ultimate End\" was reassigned to the [[Air Force Reserve]]'s [[919th Special Operations Wing]] at [[Eglin AFB]] Auxiliary Field No.3 / [[Duke Field]] on 17 June 1975, where it continued in service until retired in the fall 1994 and transferred to [[Air Force Special Operations Command]]'s ''Heritage Air Park'' at [[Hurlburt Field]], Florida.

On 26 February 1991, Coalition ground forces were driving the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. With an Air Force Reserve crew called to active duty, Azrael was sent to the [[Highway of Death|Al Jahra highway]] (Highway 80) between [[Kuwait City]] and [[Basra]], Iraq, to intercept the convoys of tanks, trucks, buses, and cars fleeing the battle.

They were published in 1809.\n\nThe first, in D major, known as the ''Ghost'', is one of his best known works in the genre (rivaled only by the ''[[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|Archduke Trio]]'').  The D major trio features themes found in the second movement of [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Symphony No. 2]].  The [[AllMusic|All-Music Guide]] states that \"because of its strangely scored and undeniably eerie-sounding slow movement, it was dubbed the 'Ghost' Trio. The name has stuck with the work ever since. The ghostly music may have had its roots in sketches for a [[Macbeth]] opera that Beethoven was contemplating at the time.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Blair|last=Johnston|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/piano-trio-in-d-major-ghost-op-70-1-mc0002368069|title=Piano Trio in D major (\"Ghost\"), Op. 70/1|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=15 October 2014}}</ref> According to Lewis Lockwood, Beethoven's pupil Carl Czerny wrote in 1842 that the slow movement reminded him (Czerny) of the ghost scene at the opening of Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'', and this was the origin of the nickname.<ref>Lockwood, Lewis. ''Beethoven: The Music and The Life'', W. W. Norton & Company (2005), p306</ref> James Keller also attributes the nickname to Czerny, adding, \"You may discard as erroneous the oft-encountered claim that this movement of the ''Ghost'' Trio is a reworking of music Beethoven originally sketched as the Witches Chorus for his ''Macbeth''.<ref>Keller, James. ''Chamber Music: A Listener's Guide'' Oxford University Press (2010) p56</ref>\n\nThese pieces are representative of Beethoven's \"Middle\" stylistic period, which went from roughly 1803 to 1812, and which included many of his most famous works.  Beethoven wrote the two piano trios while spending the summer of 1808 back once again in [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna]],<ref>{{cite web|first=Jessie|last=Rothwell|url=https://www.laphil.com/musicdb/pieces/4357/trio-in-d-major-op-70-no-1-ghost|title=Trio in D Major, Op. 70, No. 1, \"Ghost\"|publisher=[[LA Phil]]|access-date=14 October 2014}}</ref> where he had completed his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] the previous summer.  He wrote the two trios immediately after finishing his ''Sinfonia pastorale'', [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6]].  This was a period of uncertainty in Beethoven's life, in particular because he had no dependable source of income at the time.\n\nAlthough these two trios are sometimes numbered as \"No. 5\" and \"No. 6\", the numbering of Beethoven's twelve piano trios is not standardized, and in other sources the two Op. 70 trios may be shown as having different numbers, if any.\n\n== Piano Trio in D major, Op. 70 No. 1 \"Ghost\" ==\n* [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]] vivace e con brio, [[D major]], 3/4\n* [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Largo]] assai ed espressivo, [[D minor]], 2/4 [This movement is what gave the \"Ghost Trio\" its name]<ref>\"Beethoven: Biography of a Genius, by George R.

Diamondbacks pitchers [[Randy Johnson]] and [[Curt Schilling]] were both named [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series Most Valuable Players]].\n\nThe Yankees advanced to the World Series by defeating the [[2001 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]], three games to two, in the [[2001 American League Division Series|AL Division Series]], and then the [[2001 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] in the [[2001 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]], four games to one. It was the Yankees' fourth consecutive World Series appearance, after winning championships in {{wsy|1998}}, {{wsy|1999}}, and {{wsy|2000}}. The Diamondbacks advanced to the World Series by defeating the [[2001 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], three games to two, in the [[2001 National League Division Series|NL Division Series]], and then the [[2001 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in the [[2001 National League Championship Series|NL Championship Series]], four games to one. It was the franchise's first appearance in a World Series.\n\nThe Series began later than usual as a result of a delay in the regular season after the [[September 11 attacks]] and was the first to extend into November. The Diamondbacks won the first two games at home, limiting the Yankees to just one run. The Yankees responded with a close win in Game 3, at which [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] threw out the [[ceremonial first pitch]]. In Games 4 and 5, the Yankees won in comeback fashion, hitting game-tying [[home run]]s off Diamondbacks [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Byung-hyun Kim]] with one out remaining in consecutive games, before winning in extra innings. The Diamondbacks won Game 6 in a blowout, forcing a decisive Game 7. In the final game, the Yankees led in the ninth inning before the Diamondbacks staged a comeback against closer [[Mariano Rivera]], capped off by a [[Glossary of baseball (W)#walk-off home run|walk-off]], bases-loaded bloop single by [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder, born 1967)|Luis Gonzalez]] to clinch Arizona's championship victory. This was the third World Series to end in a bases-loaded, walk-off hit, following {{wsy|1991}} and {{wsy|1997}}, and to this date, the last Series to end on a walk-off of any kind. This series held the record for the latest date that a Series ended (November 4th), until that record was tied during the [[2009 World Series]] and broken during the [[2022 World Series]].\n\nAmong several firsts, the 2001 World Series was the first World Series championship for the Diamondbacks; the first World Series played in the state of Arizona or the [[Mountain Time Zone]]; the first championship for a [[Western United States|Far West state]] other than California; the first major professional sports team from the state of Arizona to win a championship; and the earliest an MLB franchise had won a World Series (the Diamondbacks had only existed for four years). The home team won every game in the Series, which had only happened twice before, in [[1987 World Series|1987]] and [[1991 World Series|1991]], both won by the [[Minnesota Twins]]. The Diamondbacks outscored the Yankees, 37–14, as a result of large margins of victory achieved by Arizona at [[Bank One Ballpark]] (now known as Chase Field) relative to the one-run margins the Yankees achieved at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Arizona's pitching held powerhouse New York to a .183 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], the lowest in a seven-game World Series ever, surpassing the [[1985 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], who hit .185 in the [[1985 World Series]].

The Yankees struck first in Game 1 when [[Derek Jeter]] was hit by a pitch with one out in the first and scored on [[Bernie Williams]]'s double two batters later. However, Arizona's [[Curt Schilling]] and two relievers, [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]] and [[Greg Swindell]] held the Yankees scoreless afterward. They managed to get only two walks and two hits for the rest of the game, [[Scott Brosius]]'s double in the second and [[Jorge Posada]]'s single in the fourth, both with two outs.\n\nMeanwhile, the Diamondbacks tied the game on [[Craig Counsell]]'s one-out home run in the first off of [[Mike Mussina]]. After a scoreless second, Mussina led off the third by hitting [[Tony Womack]] with a pitch. He moved to second on Counsell's sacrifice bunt before [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder, born 1967)|Luis Gonzalez]]'s home run put the Diamondbacks up 3–1. A single and right fielder [[David Justice]]'s error put runners on second and third before [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]]'s sacrifice fly put Arizona up 4–1. After [[Mark Grace]] was intentionally walked, [[Damian Miller]]'s RBI double gave Arizona a 5–1 lead.\n\nNext inning, Gonzalez hit a two-out double off of [[Randy Choate]]. [[Reggie Sanders]] was intentionally walked before Gonzalez scored on [[Steve Finley]]'s single. An error by third baseman Brosius scored Sanders, put Finley at third, and Williams at second. Both men scored on [[Mark Grace]]'s double, putting Arizona up 9–1. Though the Diamondbacks got just one more hit for the rest of the game off of [[Sterling Hitchcock]] and [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] (Williams' leadoff single in the seventh), they went up 1–0 in the series.\n\nThe Diamondbacks' win in Game 1 was the first World Series game won by a non-New York City team since 1997. In every World Series between 1997 and 2001, either both teams were from New York City or a New York City team won in a sweep (1998 and 1999).\n\n===Game 2===\n[[File:Matt Williams (19613632042) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] (pictured in 2015) hit a three-run home run for the Diamondbacks in the bottom of the seventh to seal a Game 2 win for Arizona.]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Sunday, October 28, 2001\n|Time=5:59{{nbsp}}pm (MST)\n|Location=Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona\n|Road=New York|RoadAbr=NYY\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=0|RH=3|RE=0\n|Home='''Arizona'''|HomeAbr=AZ\n|H1=0|H2=1|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=3|H8=0|H9=X|HR=4|HH=5|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Randy Johnson]] (1–0)|LP=[[Andy Pettitte]] (0–1)|SV=\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=[[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] (1)\n|BoxURL=https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2001/B10280ARI2001.htm\n|Other={{convert|87|F|C}}, roof open, Partly Cloudy}}\n\nArizona continued to take control of the Series with the strong pitching performance of [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]]. The Big Unit pitched a complete-game shutout, allowing only four baserunners and three hits while striking out 11 Yankees. [[Andy Pettitte]] meanwhile nearly matched him, retiring Arizona in order in five of the seven innings he pitched. In the second, he allowed a leadoff single to [[Reggie Sanders]], who scored on [[Danny Bautista]]'s double. Bautista was the only Arizona runner stranded for the entire game. In the seventh, Pettitte hit [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder, born 1967)|Luis Gonzalez]] with a pitch before Sanders grounded into a forceout. After Bautista singled, [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]]'s three-run home run put Arizona up 4–0. They won the game with that score and led the series two games to none as it moved to New York City.

Bush]], who threw the [[ceremonial first pitch]], a strike to Yankees backup catcher [[Todd Greene]]. Bush became the first [[incumbent]] U.S. president to throw a World Series first pitch since [[Jimmy Carter]] in {{wsy|1979}}. He also threw the baseball from the mound where the pitcher would be set (unlike most ceremonial first pitches which are from in front of the mound) and threw it for a strike. Chants of ''\"[[U-S-A! cheer|U-S-A]], U-S-A\"'' rang throughout Yankee Stadium. Yankees starter [[Roger Clemens]] was outstanding allowing only three hits and struck out nine in seven innings of work. Yankees closer [[Mariano Rivera]] pitched two innings for the save.\n\n[[Jorge Posada]]'s leadoff home run off of [[Brian Anderson (pitcher)|Brian Anderson]] in the second put the Yankees up 1–0. The Diamondbacks loaded the bases in the fourth on two walks and one hit before [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]]'s sacrifice fly tied the game. [[Bernie Williams]] hit a leadoff single in the sixth and moved to second on a wild pitch one out later before Posada walked. [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]] relieved Anderson and struck out [[David Justice]] before [[Scott Brosius]] broke the tie with an RBI single. That would be all the scoring as Morgan and [[Greg Swindell]] pitched the rest of the game for the Diamondbacks.

Both pitchers gave up home runs, with Schilling doing so to [[Shane Spencer]] in the third inning and Hernandez doing so to [[Mark Grace]] in the fourth. Hernandez pitched {{frac|6|1|3}} solid innings, giving up four hits while Schilling went seven innings and gave up three.\n\nWith the game still tied entering the eighth, Arizona struck. After [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] recorded the first out of the inning, [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder, born 1967)|Luis Gonzalez]] singled and [[Erubiel Durazo]] hit a double to bring him in. [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] followed by grounding into a fielder's choice off of [[Ramiro Mendoza]], which scored pinch runner [[Midre Cummings]] and gave the team a 3–1 lead.\n\nWith his team on the verge of taking a commanding 3–1 series lead, Diamondbacks manager [[Bob Brenly]] elected to bring in closer [[Byung-hyun Kim]] in the bottom of the eighth for a two-inning save. Kim, at 22, became the first Korean-born player to play in the MLB World Series. Kim struck out the side in the eighth, but ran into trouble in the ninth.\n\n[[Derek Jeter]] led off by trying to bunt for a hit but was thrown out by Williams. [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] then lined a single in front of Gonzalez. After [[Bernie Williams (born 1968)|Bernie Williams]] struck out, Kim seemed to be out of trouble with [[Tino Martinez]] coming to the plate. However, Martinez drove the first pitch he saw from Kim into the right-center field bleachers, tying the score at 3–3. The Yankees were not done, as [[Jorge Posada]] walked and [[David Justice]] moved him into scoring position with a single. Kim struck Spencer out to end the threat.\n\nWhen the scoreboard clock in Yankee Stadium passed midnight, World Series play in November began, with the message on the scoreboard \"Welcome to November Baseball\".\n\n[[Mariano Rivera]] took the hill for the Yankees in the tenth and retired the Diamondbacks in order. Kim went out for a third inning of work and retired [[Scott Brosius]] and [[Alfonso Soriano]], but Jeter hit an opposite field home run on a 3–2 pitch count from Kim. This home run gave the Yankees a 4–3 victory and tied the Series at two games apiece which guaranteed a return trip to Arizona and made Jeter the first player to hit a November home run and earning him the tongue-in-cheek nickname of \"Mr. November\".\n\n===Game 5===\n[[File:Alfonso Soriano-Yankees-11092013.jpg|thumb|[[Alfonso Soriano]] hit the game-winning single for the Yankees in the bottom of the twelfth inning, bringing the Yankees one win away from a title.]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Thursday, November 1, 2001\n|Time=8:23{{nbsp}}pm (EST)\n|Location=Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York\n|Road=Arizona|RoadAbr=AZ\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=2|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|R10=0|R11=0|R12=0|RR=2|RH=8|RE=0\n|Home='''New York'''|HomeAbr=NYY\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=2|H10=0|H11=0|H12=1|HR=3|HH=9|HE=1\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Sterling Hitchcock]] (1–0)|LP=[[Albie Lopez]] (0–1)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Steve Finley]] (1), [[Rod Barajas]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Scott Brosius]] (1)\n|BoxURL=https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2001/B11010NYA2001.htm\n|Other={{convert|61|F|C}}, Mostly cloudy}}\n\nGame 5 saw the Yankees return to [[Mike Mussina]] for the start while the Diamondbacks sent [[Miguel Batista]], who had not pitched in twelve days, to the mound. Batista pitched a strong {{frac|7|2|3}} scoreless innings, striking out six. Mussina bounced back from his poor Game 1 start, recording ten strikeouts, but allowed solo home runs in the fifth inning to [[Steve Finley]] and [[Rod Barajas]].\n\nWith the Diamondbacks leading 2–0 in the ninth, [[Byung-hyun Kim]] was called upon for the save despite having thrown three innings the night before. [[Jorge Posada]] doubled to open the inning, but Kim got [[Shane Spencer]] to ground out and then struck out [[Chuck Knoblauch]]. As had happened the previous night, Kim could not hold the lead as [[Scott Brosius]] hit a 1–0 pitch over the left field wall, the second straight game tying home run in the bottom of the ninth for the Yankees. Kim was pulled from the game in favor of [[Mike Morgan (baseball)|Mike Morgan]] who recorded the final out.\n\nMorgan retired the Yankees in order in the 10th and 11th innings, while the Diamondbacks got to [[Mariano Rivera]] in the 11th. [[Danny Bautista]] and [[Erubiel Durazo]] opened the inning with hits and [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] advanced them into scoring position with a sacrifice bunt. Rivera then intentionally walked [[Steve Finley]] to load the bases, then got [[Reggie Sanders]] to line out and [[Mark Grace]] grounded out to end the inning.\n\nArizona went to midseason trade acquisition [[Albie Lopez]] in the 12th, and in his first at bat he gave up a single to Knoblauch (who had entered the game as a pinch runner). Brosius moved him over with a bunt, and then [[Alfonso Soriano]] ended the game with an RBI single to give the Yankees a 3–2 victory and a 3–2 series lead as the series went back to Phoenix. Lopez would not pitch again in the series. [[Sterling Hitchcock]] got the win for the Yankees after he relieved Rivera for the twelfth.\n\n===Game 6===\n[[File:Randy Johnson 04.jpg|thumb|[[Randy Johnson]] allowed just two runs and struck out seven to pick up his second win of the series.]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Saturday, November 3, 2001\n|Time=5:53{{nbsp}}pm (MST)\n|Location=Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona\n|Road=New York|RoadAbr=NYY\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=2|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=2|RH=7|RE=1\n|Home='''Arizona'''|HomeAbr=AZ\n|H1=1|H2=3|H3=8|H4=3|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=X|HR=15|HH=22|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Randy Johnson]] (2–0)|LP=[[Andy Pettitte]] (0–2)|SV=\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=\n|BoxURL=https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2001/B11030ARI2001.htm\n|Other={{convert|88|F|C}}, Mostly Cloudy}}\n\nWith Arizona in a must-win situation, [[Randy Johnson]] pitched seven innings and struck out seven, giving up just two runs, and [[Bobby Witt]] and [[Troy Brohawn]] finished the blowout. The Diamondbacks struck first when [[Tony Womack]] hit a leadoff double off of [[Andy Pettitte]] and scored on [[Danny Bautista]]'s single in the first. Next inning, Womack's bases-loaded single scored two and Bautista's single scored another. The Yankees loaded the bases in the third on a single and two walks, but Johnson struck out [[Jorge Posada]] to end the inning. The Diamondbacks broke the game open with eight runs in the bottom half. Pettitte allowed a leadoff walk to [[Greg Colbrunn]] and subsequent double to [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] before being relieved by [[Jay Witasick]], who allowed four straight singles to [[Reggie Sanders]], [[Jay Bell]], [[Damian Miller]], and Johnson that scored three runs. After Womack struck out, Bautista's single scored two more runs and [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder, born 1967)|Luis Gonzalez]]'s double scored another, with Bautista being thrown out at home. Colbrunn's single and Williams's double scored a run each before Sanders struck out to end the inning. In the fourth, Bell reached first on a strike-three wild pitch before scoring on Miller's double. Johnson struck out before Womack singled to knock Witasick out of the game. With [[Randy Choate]] pitching, Yankees second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]]'s error on Bautista's ground ball allowed Miller to score and put runners on first and second before Gonzalez's single scored the Diamondbacks' final run. Choate and [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] kept them scoreless for the rest of the game. Pettitte was charged with six runs in two innings while Witasick was charged with nine runs in {{frac|1|1|3}} innings, the most runs allowed by any pitcher in a World Series game since Hall of Famer [[Walter Johnson]] also allowed nine runs in Game 7 of the [[1925 World Series]]. The Yankees scored their only runs in the sixth on back-to-back one-out singles by [[Shane Spencer]] and [[Luis Sojo]] with runners on second and third, but by then the score had become so far out of reach that it didn't do the Yankees much good. The Diamondbacks hit six doubles and Danny Bautista batted 3-for-4 with five RBIs. The team set a World Series record with 22 hits and defeated the New York Yankees in its most lopsided postseason loss in 293 postseason games, since surpassed by a 16–1 loss to the [[Boston Red Sox]] in Game 3 of the [[2018 American League Division Series]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/alds-game-3-red-sox-hand-yankees-worst-postseason-loss-team-history-032442415.html|title = ALDS Game 3: Red Sox hand Yankees worst postseason loss in team history}}</ref> The 15–2 win evened the series at three games apiece and set up a Game 7 for the ages between Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling, again pitching on three days' rest.\n\n===Game 7===\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder, born 1967)|Luis Gonzalez]] (left) hit the game (and series) winning single in the bottom of the ninth inning off [[Mariano Rivera]] to give the state of Arizona its first professional sports championship.\n| total_width = 450\n| image1    = Luis Gonzalez by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| image2    = Mariano_Rivera_allison_7_29_07.jpg\n}}\n\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Sunday, November 4, 2001\n|Time=5:55{{nbsp}}pm (MST)\n|Location=Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona\n|Road=New York|RoadAbr=NYY\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=1|R8=1|R9=0|RR=2|RH=6|RE=3\n|Home='''Arizona'''|HomeAbr=AZ\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=1|H7=0|H8=0|H9=2|HR=3|HH=11|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Randy Johnson]] (3–0)|LP=[[Mariano Rivera]] (1–1)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Alfonso Soriano]] (1)|HomeHR=\n|BoxURL=https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2001/B11040ARI2001.htm\n|Other={{convert|89|F|C}}, roof open, Mostly cloudy}}\n\nIt was a matchup of two 20-game winners in the Series finale. [[Roger Clemens]], at 39 years old, became the oldest Game 7 starter. [[Curt Schilling]] had already started two games of the Series and pitched his 300th inning of the season on just three days' rest. The two aces matched each other inning by inning and after seven full innings, the game was tied at 1–1. The Diamondbacks scored first in the sixth inning with a [[Steve Finley]] single and a [[Danny Bautista]] double (Bautista, trying to stretch it into a triple, was called out at third base). The Yankees responded with an RBI single from [[Tino Martinez]], which drove in [[Derek Jeter]] who had singled earlier. Brenly stayed with Schilling into the eighth, and the move backfired as [[Alfonso Soriano]] hit a home run on an 0–2 pitch. After Schilling struck out [[Scott Brosius]], he gave up a single to [[David Justice]], and he left the game trailing 2–1. When Brenly came to the mound to remove Schilling, he was heard on the Sounds of the Game microphone telling his clearly upset pitcher, \"love you brother, you're my hero\" and assuring him that \"that ain't gonna beat us, we're gonna get that back and then some.\" He then brought in Game 5 starter [[Miguel Batista]] to get Jeter out and then in an unconventional move, brought in the previous night's starter and winner [[Randy Johnson]], who had thrown 104 pitches, in relief to keep it a one-run game. It proved to be a smart move, as Johnson retired pinch hitter [[Chuck Knoblauch]] (who batted for the left handed [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]]) on a fly out to Bautista in right field, then returned to the mound for the top of the ninth where he got [[Bernie Williams]] to fly out to [[Steve Finley]] in center field and Martinez to ground out to [[Tony Womack]] at shortstop, and then struck out catcher [[Jorge Posada]] to send the game to the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\nWith the Yankees ahead 2–1 in the bottom of the eighth, manager [[Joe Torre]] turned the game over to his ace closer [[Mariano Rivera]] for a two-inning save. Rivera struck out the side in the eighth, including Arizona's [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder, born 1967)|Luis Gonzalez]], [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]], and Bautista. Although he was effective in the eighth, this game would end in the third ninth-inning comeback of the Series.\n\n[[Mark Grace]] led off the inning with a single to center on a 1–0 pitch. Rivera's errant throw to second base on a bunt attempt by catcher [[Damian Miller]] on an 0–1 pitch put runners on first and second. Jeter tried to reach for the ball, but got tangled in the legs of pinch-runner [[David Dellucci]], who was sliding in an attempt to break up the double play. During the next at bat, Rivera appeared to regain control when he fielded pinch hitter [[Jay Bell]]'s (who was hitting for Johnson) bunt and threw out Dellucci at third base, but third baseman Brosius decided to hold onto the baseball instead of throwing to first to complete the [[double play]]. [[Midre Cummings]] was sent in to pinch-run for [[Damian Miller]], who had reached second base safely. With Cummings at second and Bell at first, the next batter, Womack, hit a double down the right-field line on a 2–2 pitch that tied the game and earned Rivera a blown save, his first in a postseason since 1997. Bell advanced to third and the Yankees pulled the infield and outfield in as the potential winning run (Bell) stood at third with fewer than two outs. After Rivera hit [[Craig Counsell]] unintentionally with an 0–1 pitch, the bases were loaded. On an 0–1 pitch, with Williams in the on-deck circle, Gonzalez lofted a soft floater single over the drawn-in Jeter that barely reached the outfield grass, plating Jay Bell with the winning run.\n\nGonzalez's single ended New York's bid for a fourth consecutive title and brought Arizona its first championship in its fourth year of existence, making the Diamondbacks the fastest expansion team to win a World Series (beating out the [[1997 Florida Marlins season|1997 Florida Marlins]], who had done it in their fifth season at that time). It was also the first, and remains the only, major professional sports championship for the state of Arizona. [[Randy Johnson]] picked up his third win.  Rivera took the loss, his only postseason loss in his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=riverma01&t=p&post=1|title=Mariano Rivera Postseason Pitching Gamelogs|website=Baseball-Reference.com|access-date=May 23, 2021}}</ref> Coincidentally, this was also the second World Series in a 5-year span (1997 to 2001) to end with a game-winning RBI single. [[Edgar Renteria]] hit the game-winner in the 1997 series, while Gonzalez hit it here, with Craig Counsell being on the basepaths for each. No other World Series has ended with a game-winning hit since 2001.\n\nIn 2009, Game 7 of the 2001 World Series was chosen by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' as the [[List of 2009 all-decade Sports Illustrated awards and honors#Major League Baseball|Best Postseason Game of the Decade]] (2000–2009).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2009/12/09/mlb-highlightslowlights|periodical=Sports Illustrated|title=MLB: Highlights and lowlights|date=December 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the years that have followed, many fans regardless of team allegiance consider Game 7 of the 2001 World Series to be one of the greatest games ever played in the history of professional baseball.\n\n==Composite box==\n2001 World Series '''(4–3): [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] (N.L.)''' over [[New York Yankees]] (A.L.)\n{{Linescore\n|Road='''[[Arizona Diamondbacks]]'''\n|R1=2|R2=4|R3=12|R4=9|R5=2|R6=1|R7=3|R8=2|R9=2|R10=0|R11=0|R12=0|RR=37|RH=65|RE=3\n|Home=[[New York Yankees]]\n|H1=1|H2=1|H3=1|H4=0|H5=0|H6=3|H7=1|H8=1|H9=4|H10=1|H11=0|H12=1|HR=14|HH=42|HE=8\n|TotalAttendance=366,289 |AveAttendance=52,327\n|WinPlayerShare=$279,260 |LosePlayerShare=$201,014<ref name=\"wsshares\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml|title=World Series Gate Receipts and Player Shares|access-date=June 14, 2009|publisher=Baseball Almanac| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090502011628/http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml| archive-date= May 2, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Media coverage==\nFor the second consecutive year, [[MLB on Fox|Fox]] carried the World Series over its network with its top broadcast team, [[Joe Buck]] and [[Tim McCarver]] (himself a [[List of New York Yankees broadcasters|Yankees broadcaster]]). This was the first year of Fox's exclusive rights to the World Series (in the previous contract, Fox only broadcast the World Series in even numbered years while [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] broadcast it in odd numbered years), which it has held since (this particular contract also had given Fox exclusive rights to the entire baseball postseason, which aired over its family of networks; the contract was modified following [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s purchase of [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]] shortly after the World Series ended, as ESPN regained their postseason rights following a year of [[Major League Baseball on Fox Family|postseason games on ABC Family]], Fox Family's successor). [[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio|ESPN Radio]] provided national radio coverage for the fourth consecutive year, with [[Jon Miller]] and [[Joe Morgan]] calling the action.\n\nLocally, the Series was broadcast by [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR-AM]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] with [[Thom Brennaman]], [[Greg Schulte]], [[Rod Allen]] and [[Jim Traber]], and by [[WABC (AM)|WABC-AM]] in New York City with [[John Sterling (sportscaster)|John Sterling]] and [[Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)|Michael Kay]]. This would be Sterling and Kay's last World Series working together, and Game 7 would be the last Yankee broadcast on WABC. Kay moved to television and the new [[YES Network]] the following season and [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] picked up radio rights to the Yankees. It was Kay who announced [[Derek Jeter]]'s game-winning home run in Game 4 of the series and subsequently anointed him as \"Mr. November\".\n\n===Books and films===\n[[Buster Olney]], who covered the Yankees for ''[[The New York Times]]'' before joining ESPN, would write a book titled ''[[The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty]]'', published in 2004. The book is a play by play account of Game 7 in addition to stories about key players, executives, and moments from the 1996–2001 dynasty. In a 2005 reprinting, Olney included a new epilogue covering the aftermath of the 2001 World Series up to the Boston Red Sox epic comeback from down 3–0 in the 2004 ALCS.\n\nThe official MLB Productions documentary film of the series was released in 2001.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313159/ 2001 World Series]</ref>\n\nIn 2004, [[HBO]] released ''Nine Innings from Ground Zero'', a documentary focusing on the special role that baseball, and particularly the Yankees, played in helping to heal New York after 9/11. The film features interviews with players, fans who lost family members, firefighters, sportswriters, and George W. Bush.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nine Innings from Ground Zero |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407085358/https://ew.com/article/2005/04/04/nine-innings-ground-zero/ |archive-date=2023-04-07 |url-status=live |url=https://ew.com/article/2005/04/04/nine-innings-ground-zero/}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, A&E Home Video released the ''New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996–2001)'' DVD set. Game 4 of the 2001 World Series is included in the set. In 2008, ''The Arizona Diamondbacks 2001 World Series'' DVD set was released. All seven games are included on this set.\n\n==Aftermath==\nRivera's blown save and the Yankees' loss proved to be life-saving for Yankees utility player [[Enrique Wilson]]. Had the Yankees won, Wilson was planning to fly home to the [[Dominican Republic]] on [[American Airlines Flight 587]] on November 12 after what would have been a Yankees victory parade down the [[Canyon of Heroes]]. But after the Yankees lost, Wilson moved up his flight. Flight 587 would crash in Belle Harbor, Queens, killing everyone on board.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1175851-mariano-rivera-why-hes-the-most-irreplaceable-reliever-in-mlb-history|title=Mariano Rivera: Why He's the Most Irreplaceable Reliever in MLB History|last=Buckley|first=Brian|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=2019-04-21|date=May 8, 2012}}</ref> Rivera later said, \"I am glad we lost the World Series because it means that I still have a friend.\"<ref>[https://www.espn.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=olney_buster&id=2051491 Epilogue: 'The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty']</ref>\n\nDuring the offseason, several Yankees moved on to other teams or retired, the most notable changes being the off season trades of Martinez and Knoblauch to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[Kansas City Royals]] respectively in free agency, and Brosius and O'Neill retiring. Martinez would later return to the Yankees to finish his career in 2005.\n\nAfter winning the NL West again in 2002 the [[2002 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]] were swept 3–0 by [[2002 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] in the [[2002 National League Division Series|NLDS]]. From here they declined, losing 111 games in [[2004 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2004]] as Bob Brenly was fired during that season. Arizona would not win another NL West title until [[2007 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2007]]. Schilling was traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]] after the [[2003 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2003 season]] and in [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|2004]] helped lead them to their first [[2004 World Series|World Series]] championship since [[1918 Boston Red Sox season|1918]]. He helped them win another championship in [[2007 World Series|2007]] and retired after four years with Boston, missing the entire 2008 season with a shoulder injury. Johnson was traded to the Yankees after the 2004 season, a season that saw him [[Randy Johnson's perfect game|throw a perfect game]] against the [[2004 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], though he would be traded back to the Diamondbacks two years later and finish his career with the [[2009 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in 2009. The last player from the 2001 Diamondbacks roster, [[Lyle Overbay]], retired following the 2014 season with the [[2014 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] while the last player from the 2001 Yankees, [[Randy Choate]], retired following the 2016 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/16/sweeny-randy-choate-retirement/|title = Randy Choate, Longtime Left-Handed Relief Pitcher, Retires|date = February 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2002 through 2007, the Yankees' misfortune in the postseason continued, with the team losing the [[2002 American League Division Series|ALDS]] to the [[2002 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]] in 2002, the [[2003 World Series|World Series]] to the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] in 2003, the [[2004 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] to the [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] (in the process becoming the first team in postseason history to blow a 3–0 series lead) in 2004, the [[2005 American League Division Series|ALDS]] again to the [[2005 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] in 2005, and then losing the ALDS to the [[2006 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] and the [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in [[2006 American League Division Series|2006]] and [[2007 American League Division Series|2007]], respectively. In addition, including the World Series loss in 2001, every World Series champion from 2001 to 2004 won the title at the Yankees' expense in postseason play, which is an AL record and as of [[2023 Major League Baseball season|2023]] tied for the MLB record with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] from 2016 to 2019.  [[Joe Torre]]'s contract was allowed to expire and he was replaced by [[Joe Girardi]] in 2008, a season in which the Yankees would miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993. The Yankees won their 27th World Series championship in 2009, defeating the defending [[2008 World Series|2008 champion]] [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] in six games, but could not pull off another dynasty like they did during the late 1990s and early 2000s; in fact, they failed to reach the World Series during the entirety of the 2010s.\n\nTo date, this is the state of [[Arizona]]'s only championship among the [[major professional sports teams of the United States and Canada|four major North American men’s professional sports]]. However, the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]'s [[Phoenix Mercury]] have won three championships since then ([[2007 Phoenix Mercury season|2007]], [[2009 Phoenix Mercury season|2009]], and [[2014 Phoenix Mercury season|2014]]).\n\nThe Diamondbacks and the [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]], who won the [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl]] earlier in 2001, created the first instance of two major sports teams winning a championship game or series on their first attempts.  This would not occur again until 2019, when the [[2018–19 Toronto Raptors season|Toronto Raptors]] and [[2019 Washington Nationals season|Washington Nationals]] accomplished this feat.\n\nThe Diamondbacks would not return to the World Series again until [[2023 World Series|2023]]; this time, they would go on to lose to the [[2023 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] in five games.\n\n==See also==\n* [[2001 Japan Series]]\n\n== General sources ==\n* {{cite web |author=Forman, Sean L. |title=2001 World Series |work=Baseball-Reference.com – Major League Statistics and Information. |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2001_WS.shtml |access-date=December 9, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071203014004/http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2001_WS.shtml| archive-date= December 3, 2007 | url-status= live}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{WSExtLinks|year=2001}}\n* [http://www.euchner.us: Book on 2001 WS is \"the last word on the inside game of baseball\"]\n* [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/2001/postseason/ SI.com: MLB Postseason 2001]\n* [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/01play/index.htm USA Today: Quest for a Title]\n* [http://www.sportsline.com/u/baseball/mlb/2001/playoffs/ CBS Sportsline: 2001 MLB Playoffs]\n\n{{Portal bar|Arizona|Baseball|New York City}}\n{{2001 MLB Playoffs navbox}}\n{{World Series}}\n{{2001 Arizona Diamondbacks}}\n{{Arizona Diamondbacks}}\n{{New York Yankees}}\n{{2001 MLB season by team}}\n{{MLB on Fox}}\n{{Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio}}\n{{Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding Live Sports Special}}\n\n[[Category:2000s in Phoenix, Arizona]]\n[[Category:2000s in the Bronx]]\n[[Category:2001 in sports in Arizona|World Series]]\n[[Category:2001 in sports in New York City|World Series]]\n[[Category:2001 Major League Baseball season|World Series]]\n[[Category:Baseball competitions in New York City]]\n[[Category:Baseball competitions in Phoenix, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Sports events affected by the September 11 attacks|World Series]]\n[[Category:Arizona Diamondbacks postseason]]\n[[Category:New York Yankees postseason]]\n[[Category:November 2001 sports events in the United States|World Series]]\n[[Category:October 2001 sports events in the United States|World Series]]\n[[Category:World Series]]","_bytes":63477,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2023-11-19T22:53:09Z"},"title":"2001 World Series","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}

It matched the [[American League]] (AL) champion [[1903 Boston Americans season|Boston Americans]] against the [[National League (baseball)|National League]] (NL) champion [[1903 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]{{NoteTag|In the early 20th century and earlier, the [[name of Pittsburgh]] was spelled with and without the 'h'.}} in a best-of-nine series, with Boston prevailing five games to three, winning the last four.  The first three games were played in Boston, the next four in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny]] (home of the Pirates), and the eighth (last) game in Boston.\n\nPittsburgh pitcher [[Sam Leever]] injured his shoulder while [[trap shooting]], so his teammate [[Deacon Phillippe]] pitched five complete games. Phillippe won three of his games, but it was not enough to overcome the club from the new American League. Boston pitchers [[Bill Dinneen]] and [[Cy Young]] led Boston to victory. In Game 1, Phillippe struck out ten Boston batters. The next day, Dinneen bettered that mark, striking out 11 Pittsburgh batters in Game 2.\n\n[[Honus Wagner]], bothered by injuries, batted only 6-for-27 (.222) in the Series and committed six errors.  The shortstop was deeply distraught by his performance.  The following spring, Wagner (who in 1903 led the National League in batting average) refused to send his portrait to a \"Hall of Fame\" for batting champions. \"I was too bum last year\", he wrote. \"I was a joke in that Boston-Pittsburgh Series.

Such a large comeback would not happen again until the Pirates came back to defeat the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] in the [[1925 World Series]], and has happened only 11 times in baseball history. (The Pirates themselves repeated this feat in {{wsy|1979}} against the [[Baltimore Orioles]].) Much was made of the influence of Boston's \"[[Royal Rooters]]\", who traveled to Exposition Park and sang their theme song \"[[Tessie]]\" to distract the opposing players (especially Wagner). Boston wound up winning three out of four games in Allegheny City.\n\nPirates owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]] added his share of the gate receipts to the players' share, so the losing team's players actually finished with a larger individual share than the winning team's.\n\nThe Series brought the new American League prestige and proved its best could beat the best of the National League, thus strengthening the demand for future World Series competitions.\n\n==Background==\n\n===A new league===\nIn 1901, [[Ban Johnson]], president of the [[Western League (1885–1899)|Western League]], a minor league organization, formed the [[American League]] to take advantage of the National League's 1900 contraction from twelve teams to eight.  Johnson and fellow owners raided the National League and signed away many star players, including [[Cy Young]] and [[Jimmy Collins]].  Johnson had a list of 46 National Leaguers he targeted for the American League; by 1902, all but one had made the jump.<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|page=99}} The constant raiding, however, nixed the idea of a championship between the two leagues. Pirates owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]], whose team ran away with the 1902 National League pennant, was open to a postseason contest and even said he would allow the American League champion to stock its roster with all-stars.<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|page=105}}  However, Johnson had spoken of putting a team in [[Pittsburgh]] and even attempted to raid the Pirates' roster in August 1902, which soured Dreyfuss.  At the end of the season, however, the Pirates played a group of American League All-Stars in a four-game exhibition series, winning two games to one, with one tie.<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|page=102}}\n\nThe leagues finally called a truce in the winter of 1902–03 and formed the [[National Baseball Commission|National Commission]] to preside over organized baseball. The following season, the Boston Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates had secured their respective championship pennants by September. That August, Dreyfuss challenged the American League to an 11-game championship series.  Encouraged by Johnson and National League President [[Harry Pulliam]], Americans owner Henry J. Killilea met with Dreyfuss in Pittsburgh in September and instead agreed to a best-of-nine championship, with the first three games played in Boston, the next four in Allegheny City, and the remaining two (if necessary) in Boston.<ref name=\"devaleria95\"/>{{rp|page=122}}\n\nOne significant point about this agreement was that it was an arrangement primarily between the two clubs rather than a formal arrangement between the leagues. In short, it was a voluntary event, a fact which would result in no Series at all for {{wsy|1904}}. The formal establishment of the Series as a compulsory event started in {{wsy|1905}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsmenu.shtml|title=World Series: Every World Series in Major League Baseball History |website=Baseball Almanac |access-date=2017-02-03}}</ref>\n\n==The teams==\n[[File:1903 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 1903 Pittsburgh Pirates]]\nThe Pirates won their third straight pennant in 1903 thanks to a powerful lineup that included legendary shortstop [[Honus Wagner]], who hit .355 and drove in 101 runs, player-manager [[Fred Clarke]], who hit .351, and [[Ginger Beaumont]], who hit .341 and led the league in hits and runs.

But Phillippe's second straight win was almost not to be, as the Americans, down 5–1 in the top of the ninth, rallied to narrow the deficit to one run.

The governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was re-elected to serve a second term in government with another [[landslide victory]] with a 167 majority, returning 412 members of Parliament versus 418 from the 1997 general election, a net loss of six seats, though with a significantly lower turnout than before—59.4%, compared to 71.6% at the previous election.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2001-06-08 |title=Turnout 'at 80-year low' |language=en-GB |work=[[BBC]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1376000/1376575.stm |access-date=2022-12-07}}</ref> The number of votes Labour received fell by nearly three million. [[Tony Blair]] went on to become the only Labour Prime Minister to serve two consecutive full terms in office. As Labour retained almost all of their seats won in the 1997 landslide victory, the media dubbed the 2001 election \"the quiet landslide\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Parkinson|first1=Justin|title=The rise and fall of New Labour|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-10518842|work=BBC News|access-date=12 May 2015|date=3 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere was little change outside [[Northern Ireland]], with 620 out of the 641 seats in [[Great Britain]] electing candidates from the same party as they did in 1997. Factors contributing to the Labour victory included a strong economy, falling unemployment, and public perception that the Labour government had delivered on many key election pledges that it had made in 1997.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\nThe opposition [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], under [[William Hague]]'s leadership, was still deeply divided on the issue of [[European Union|Europe]] and the party's policy platform had drifted considerably to the [[right-wing politics|right]]. The party put the issue of [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|European monetary union]] (and in particular, the prospect of the UK joining the [[Eurozone]]) at the centre of its campaign, but it failed to resonate with the electorate. The Tories briefly had a narrow lead in the polls during the 2000 fuel strikes, but Labour successfully resolved them by year end. Furthermore, a series of publicity stunts that backfired also harmed Hague, and he immediately announced his resignation as party leader when the election result was clear, formally stepping down three months later, therefore becoming the first leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party in the House of Commons since [[Austen Chamberlain]] nearly eighty years prior not to serve as prime minister.\n\nThe election was largely a repeat of the 1997 general election, with Labour losing only six seats overall and the Conservatives making a net gain of one seat (gaining nine seats but losing eight). The Conservatives gained [[Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|a seat]] in [[Scotland]], which ended the party's status as an \"[[England]]-only\" party in the prior parliament, but failed again to win any seats in [[Wales]]. Although they did not gain many seats, three of the few new MPs elected were future Conservative Prime Ministers [[David Cameron]] and [[Boris Johnson]] and future Conservative [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]]; Osborne would serve in the same Cabinet as Cameron from 2010 to 2016. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] made a net gain of six seats.\n\nThe 2001 general election is the last to date in which any government has held an overall majority of more than 100 seats in the House of Commons, and the second of only two since the [[World War II|Second World War]] (the other being 1997) in which a single party won over 400 MPs. Notable departing MPs included former Prime Ministers [[Edward Heath]] (also [[Father of the House (United Kingdom)|Father of the House]]) and [[John Major]], former Deputy Prime Minister [[Michael Heseltine]], former Liberal Democrat leader [[Paddy Ashdown]], former Cabinet ministers [[Tony Benn]], [[Tom King, Baron King of Bridgwater|Tom King]], [[John Morris, Baron Morris of Aberavon|John Morris]], [[Mo Mowlam]], [[John MacGregor, Baron MacGregor of Pulham Market|John MacGregor]] and [[Peter Brooke, Baron Brooke of Sutton Mandeville|Peter Brooke]], [[Teresa Gorman]], and then [[Mayor of London]] [[Ken Livingstone]].\n\nChange was seen in Northern Ireland, with the moderate [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) losing four seats to the more hardline [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). A similar transition appeared in the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] community, with the moderate [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) losing votes to the more staunchly [[Irish republicanism|republican]] and [[abstentionism|abstentionist]] [[Sinn Féin]].\n\nExceptionally low voter turnout, which fell below 60% for the first (and so far, only) time since [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]], also marked this election.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Audickas |first1=Lukas |last2=Cracknell |first2=Richard |title=UK Election Statistics: 1918–2018: 100 Years of Elections |url=https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7529/CBP-7529.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7529/CBP-7529.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |page=25 |date=13 December 2018 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |department=Briefing Paper Number CBP7529 |access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref> The election was broadcast live on [[BBC One]] and presented by [[David Dimbleby]], [[Jeremy Paxman]], [[Andrew Marr]], [[Peter Snow]], and [[Anthony King (political scientist)|Tony King]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HGDplurdMQ| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211123/-HGDplurdMQ| archive-date=2021-11-23 | url-status=live|title=BBC Vote 2001 Coverage| website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nThe 2001 general election was notable for being the first in which pictures of the party logos appeared on the ballot paper.

Throughout the election the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had maintained a significant lead in the opinion polls and the result was deemed to be so certain that some [[bookmaker]]s paid out for a Labour majority before election day. However, the opinion polls the previous autumn had shown the first Tory lead (though only by a narrow margin) in the opinion polls for eight years as they benefited from the public anger towards the government over the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel protests]] which had led to a severe shortage of motor fuel.\n\nBy the end of 2000, however, the dispute had been resolved and Labour were firmly back in the lead of the opinion polls.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1322000/1322211.stm |work=BBC News |title=Tories 'to cut fuel duty' |date=10 May 2001 |access-date=26 October 2015}}</ref> In total, a mere 29 parliamentary seats changed hands at the 2001 Election.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/basics/4393329.stm | work=BBC News | title=2001: Labour claims second term | date=5 April 2005 | access-date=26 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n2001 also saw the rare election of an independent. [[Richard Taylor (British politician)|Richard Taylor]] of [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]] (usually now known simply as \"Health Concern\") unseated a government MP, [[David Lock]], in [[Wyre Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre Forest]]. There was also a high vote for [[British National Party]] leader [[Nick Griffin]] in [[Oldham West and Royton (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham West and Royton]], in the wake of recent [[2001 Oldham riots|race riots]] in the town of [[Oldham]].\n\nIn [[Northern Ireland]], the election was far more dramatic and marked a move by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] away from support for the [[Good Friday Agreement]], with the moderate unionist [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) losing to the more hardline [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). This polarisation was also seen in the nationalist community, with the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) vote losing out to more left-wing and republican [[Sinn Féin]]. It also saw a tightening of the parties as the small [[UK Unionist Party]] lost its only seat.\n\n==Campaign==\nFor Labour, the last four years had run relatively smoothly.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harrop |first1=Martin |title=An Apathetic Landslide: The British Election of 2001 |date=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=295-313 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44484398}}</ref> The party had successfully defended all their [[Lists of United Kingdom by-elections|by election]] seats, and many suspected a Labour win was inevitable from the start.\n\nMany in the party, however, were afraid of voter apathy, which was epitomised in a poster of \"Hague with [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s hair\", captioned \"Get out and vote. Or they get in.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/election2001/poster/0,,498578,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420050156/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/election2001/poster/0,,498578,00.html |archive-date=20 April 2017 |location=London |work=The Guardian|title='Get out and vote. Or they get in.' – Election 2001}}</ref> Despite recessions in mainland Europe and the [[United States]], due to the bursting of global tech bubbles, Britain was notably unaffected and Labour however could rely on a strong economy as unemployment continued to decline toward election day, putting to rest any fears of a Labour government putting the economic situation at risk.\n\nFor [[William Hague]], however, the Conservative Party had still not fully recovered from the loss in 1997. The party was still divided over Europe, and talk of a referendum on [[United Kingdom and the euro|joining the Eurozone]] was rife, and as a result \"Save The Pound\" was one of the key slogans deployed in the Conservatives' campaign.  As Labour remained at the political centre, the Tories moved to the right. A policy gaffe by [[Oliver Letwin]] over public spending cuts left the party with an own goal that Labour soon exploited.\n\nThatcher gave a speech to the Conservative Election Rally in Plymouth on 22 May 2001, calling [[New Labour]] \"rootless, empty, and artificial.\" She also added to Hague's troubles when speaking out strongly against the Euro to applause. Hague himself, although a witty performer at [[Prime Minister's Questions]], was dogged in the press and reminded of his speech, given at the age of 16, at the 1977 [[Conservative Party Conference (UK)|Conservative Conference]]. ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper only added to the Conservatives' woes by backing Labour for a second consecutive election, calling Hague a \"[[Dead Parrot sketch|dead parrot]]\" during the Conservative Party's conference in October 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ThhguC97EdA/STaU-tJdVzI/AAAAAAAAASA/GVBGsJaLKAI/s400/PARROT-HAGUE.jpg |title=Sun newspaper front page |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210603054401/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ThhguC97EdA/STaU-tJdVzI/AAAAAAAAASA/GVBGsJaLKAI/s400/PARROT-HAGUE.jpg |archive-date=3 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Sun prints Tories' obituary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/187130.stm |work=BBC News Online |location=London |date=7 October 1998 |access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=McElvoy |first=Anne |author-link=Anne McElvoy |date=7 October 1998 |title=Hague's parrot is not dead, he's just resting – with the odd squawk |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/hagues-parrot-is-not-dead-hes-just-resting-with-the-odd-squawk-1176592.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220501/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/hagues-parrot-is-not-dead-hes-just-resting-with-the-odd-squawk-1176592.html |archive-date=1 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |access-date=1 April 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nThe Tories campaigned on a strongly right-wing platform, emphasising the issues of Europe, immigration and tax, the fabled [[Norman Tebbit|\"Tebbit Trinity\"]].

Labour also capitalised on the strong economic conditions of the time, and another major line of attack (primarily directed towards [[Michael Portillo]], now Shadow Chancellor after returning to Parliament via a [[1999 Kensington and Chelsea by-election|by-election]]) was to warn of a return to \"Tory Boom and Bust\" under a Conservative administration.\n\n[[Charles Kennedy]] contested his first election as leader of the Liberal Democrats.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393329.stm | work=BBC News | title=2001: Labour claims second term | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nDuring the election Sharron Storer, a resident of [[Birmingham]], criticised Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in front of television cameras about conditions in the [[National Health Service]].

Having presided over relatively serene political, economic and social conditions, the feeling of prosperity in the United Kingdom had been maintained into the new millennium, and Labour would have a free hand to assert its ideals in the subsequent parliament. Despite the victory, voter apathy was a major issue, as turnout fell below 60%, 12 percentage points down on 1997. All three of the main parties saw their total votes fall, with Labour's total vote dropping by 2.8 million on 1997, the Conservatives 1.3 million, and the Liberal Democrats 428,000. Some suggested this dramatic fall was a sign of the general acceptance of the status quo and the likelihood of Labour's majority remaining unassailable.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1383000/1383403.stm | work=BBC News | title=The poll that never was | date=11 June 2001}}</ref>\n\nFor the Conservatives, the huge loss they had sustained in 1997 was repeated. Despite gaining nine seats, the Tories lost seven to the Liberal Democrats, and [[South Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|one even to Labour]]. [[William Hague]] was quick to announce his resignation, doing so at 07:44 outside the Conservative Party headquarters. Some believed that Hague had been unlucky; although most considered him to be a talented orator and an intelligent statesman, he had come up against the charismatic [[Tony Blair]] in the peak of his political career, and it was no surprise that little progress was made in reducing Labour's majority after a relatively smooth parliament.\n\nStaying at what they considered rock bottom, however, showed that the Conservatives had failed to improve their negative public image, had remained somewhat disunited over Europe, and had not regained the trust that they had lost in the 1990s.  Hague's focus on the \"Save The Pound\" campaign narrative had failed to gain any traction; Labour's successful countertactic was to be repeatedly vague over the issue of future monetary union - and said that the UK would only consider joining the Eurozone \"when conditions were right\". But in [[2001 United Kingdom general election in Scotland|Scotland]], despite flipping one seat from the [[Scottish National Party]], their vote collapse continued. They failed to retake former strongholds in Scotland as the Nationalists consolidated their grip on the Northeastern portion of the country.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1377000/1377378.stm | work=BBC News | title=Labour romps home again | date=8 June 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Liberal Democrats could point to steady progress under their new leader, [[Charles Kennedy]], gaining more seats than the main two parties—albeit only six overall—and maintaining the performance of a pleasing 1997 election, where the party had doubled its number of seats from 20 to 46. While they had yet to become electable as a government, they underlined their growing reputation as a worthwhile alternative to Labour and Conservative, offering plenty of debate in Parliament and representing more than a mere protest vote.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe SNP failed to gain any new seats and lost a seat to the Conservatives by just 79 votes. In [[2001 United Kingdom general election in Wales|Wales]], [[Plaid Cymru]] both gained [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (UK Parliament constituency)|a seat]] from Labour and lost [[Ynys Môn (UK

In addition to being the first operational long-range SAM and the first operational pulse doppler aviation radar,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Tactical missile aerodynamics, Volume 141. P17. Michael J. Hemsch, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1992</ref> it was the only SAM deployed by the [[United States Air Force]].\n\nStored horizontally in a launcher shelter with a movable roof, the missile was erected, fired vertically using [[Booster (rocketry)|rocket boosters]] to high altitude, and then tipped over into a horizontal Mach 2.5 cruise powered by [[ramjet]] engines. This lofted trajectory allowed the missile to operate at a maximum range as great as 430&nbsp;mi (700&nbsp;km). Controlled from the ground for most of its flight, when it reached the target area it was commanded to begin a dive, activating an onboard [[active radar homing]] seeker for [[terminal guidance]]. A radar [[proximity fuse]] detonated the warhead, either a large conventional explosive or the [[W40 (nuclear warhead)|W40 nuclear warhead]].\n\nThe Air Force originally planned for a total of 52 sites covering most of the major cities and industrial regions in the US. The [[US Army]] was deploying their own systems at the same time, and the two services fought constantly both in political circles and in the press. Development dragged on, and by the time it was ready for deployment in the late 1950s, the nuclear threat had moved from manned bombers to the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM). By this time the Army had successfully deployed the much shorter range [[Nike Hercules]] that they claimed filled any possible need through the 1960s, in spite of Air Force claims to the contrary.<ref>Tactical missile aerodynamics, Volume 141.  Michael J. Hemsch, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1992</ref>\n\nAs testing continued, the Air Force reduced its plans to sixteen sites, and then again to eight with an additional two sites in Canada. The first US site was declared operational in 1959, but with only a single working missile. Bringing the rest of the missiles into service took years, by which time the system was obsolete. Deactivations began in 1969 and by 1972 all Bomarc sites had been shut down. A small number were used as target drones, and only a few remain on display today.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Bomarc A===\nIn 1946, Boeing started to study surface-to-air guided missiles under the [[United States Army Air Forces]] project MX-606. By 1950, Boeing had launched more than 100 test rockets in various configurations, all under the designator XSAM-A-1 GAPA (Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft). Because these tests were very promising, Boeing received a USAF contract in 1949 to develop a pilotless interceptor (a term then used by the USAF for air-defense guided missiles) under project MX-1599.<ref name=\"Gibson\">Gibson 1996, pp. 200–201.</ref>\n\nThe MX-1599 missile was to be a ramjet-powered, nuclear-armed long-range surface-to-air missile to defend the Continental United States from high-flying bombers. The [[Michigan Aeronautical Research Center|Michigan Aerospace Research Center]] (MARC) was added to the project soon afterward, and this gave the new missile its name Bomarc (for Boeing and MARC). In 1951, the USAF decided to emphasize its point of view that missiles were nothing else than pilotless aircraft by assigning aircraft designators to its missile projects, and anti-aircraft missiles received F-for-Fighter designations. The Bomarc became the '''F-99'''.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nTest flights of XF-99 test vehicles began in September 1952 and continued through early 1955.{{r|McMullen1980_312}} The XF-99 tested only the liquid-fueled booster rocket, which would accelerate the missile to ramjet ignition speed. In February 1955, tests of the XF-99A propulsion test vehicles began. These included live ramjets, but still had no guidance system or warhead. The designation YF-99A had been reserved for the operational test vehicles. In August 1955, the USAF discontinued the use of aircraft-like type designators for missiles, and the XF-99A and YF-99A became XIM-99A and YIM-99A, respectively. Originally the USAF had allocated the designation IM-69, but this was changed (possibly at Boeing's request to keep number 99) to '''IM-99''' in October 1955.\n\nIn October 1957, the first YIM-99A production-representative prototype flew with full guidance, and succeeded to pass the target within destructive range. In late 1957, Boeing received the production contract for the IM-99A Bomarc A interceptor missile, and in September 1959, the first IM-99A squadron became operational.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nThe IM-99A had an operational radius of {{convert|200|mi|km}} and was designed to fly at [[Mach number|Mach]]&nbsp;2.5–2.8 at a cruising altitude of {{convert|60000|ft|m}}. It was {{convert|46.6|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and weighed {{convert|15500|lb|kg}}. Its armament was either a {{convert|1000|lb|kg|adj=on}} conventional warhead or a [[W40 (nuclear warhead)|W40 nuclear warhead]] (7–10 [[TNT equivalent|kiloton]] yield). A [[Liquid-propellant rocket|liquid-fuel rocket]] engine boosted the Bomarc to Mach 2, when its [[Marquardt RJ43|Marquardt RJ43-MA-3]] [[ramjet]] engines, fueled by 80-octane gasoline, would take over for the remainder of the flight. This was the same model of engine used to power the [[Lockheed X-7]], the [[Lockheed AQM-60 Kingfisher]] drone used to test air defenses, and the [[Lockheed D-21]] launched from the back of an [[Lockheed A-12#M-21|M-21]], although the Bomarc and Kingfisher engines used different materials due to the longer duration of their flights.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\n===Operational units===\n[[File:CIM-10 Bomarc missile battery.jpg|right|thumb|October 1960, BOMARCs in New Jersey ([[BOMARC Missile Accident Site|BOMARC Site No. 1]]) ]]\n\nThe operational IM-99A missiles were based horizontally in semi-hardened shelters, nicknamed \"coffins\". After the launch order, the shelter's roof would slide open,  and the missile raised to the vertical. After the missile was supplied with fuel for the booster rocket, it would be launched by the Aerojet General LR59-AJ-13 booster. After sufficient speed was reached, the Marquardt RJ43-MA-3 ramjets would ignite and propel the missile to its cruise speed of Mach&nbsp;2.8 at an altitude of {{convert|20000|m|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nWhen the Bomarc was within {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip|round=5}} of the target, its own Westinghouse AN/DPN-34 radar guided the missile to the interception point. The maximum range of the IM-99A was {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and it was fitted with either a conventional high-explosive or a 10&nbsp;kiloton W-40 nuclear fission warhead.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nThe Bomarc relied on the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE), an automated control system used by [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] for detecting, tracking and intercepting enemy [[Bomber|bomber aircraft]]. SAGE allowed for remote launching of the Bomarc missiles, which were housed in a constant combat-ready basis in individual launch shelters in remote areas. At the height of the program, there were 14 Bomarc sites located in the US and two in Canada.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\n===Bomarc B===\nThe liquid-fuel booster of the Bomarc A had several drawbacks. It took two minutes to fuel before launch, which could be a long time in high-speed intercepts, and its [[hypergolic propellant]]s (hydrazine and nitric acid) were very dangerous to handle, leading to several serious accidents.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nAs soon as high-thrust [[solid-fuel rocket]]s became a reality in the mid-1950s, the USAF began to develop a new solid-fueled Bomarc variant, the IM-99B Bomarc&nbsp;B. It used a [[Thiokol]] XM51 booster, and also had improved Marquardt RJ43-MA-7 (and finally the RJ43-MA-11) ramjets. The first IM-99B was launched in May 1959, but problems with the new propulsion system delayed the first fully successful flight until July 1960, when a supersonic [[SSM-N-9 Regulus II|MQM-15A Regulus II]] drone was intercepted. Because the new booster required less space in the missile, more ramjet fuel could be carried, thus increasing the range to {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The terminal homing system was also improved, using the world's first [[Pulse-Doppler radar|pulse Doppler search radar]], the Westinghouse AN/DPN-53.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> All Bomarc&nbsp;Bs were equipped with the W-40 nuclear warhead. In June 1961, the first IM-99B squadron became operational, and Bomarc&nbsp;B quickly replaced most Bomarc&nbsp;A missiles.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/> On 23 March 1961, a Bomarc&nbsp;B successfully intercepted a Regulus&nbsp;II cruise missile flying at {{cvt|100000|ft|m}}, thus achieving the highest interception in the world up to that date.\n\nBoeing built 570 Bomarc missiles between 1957 and 1964, 269 CIM-10A, 301 CIM-10B.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\n[[File:4751st Air Defense Squadron - ADC - Emblem.png|thumb|125px|4751st ADMS (Training) Emblem]]\n\nIn September 1958 Air Research & Development Command decided to transfer the Bomarc program from its testing at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to a new facility on [[Santa Rosa Island (Florida)|Santa Rosa Island]], south of Eglin AFB [[Hurlburt Field]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. To operate the facility and to provide training and operational evaluation in the missile program, [[Aerospace Defense Command|Air Defense Command]] established the 4751st Air Defense Wing (Missile) (4751st ADW) on 15 January 1958. The first launch from Santa Rosa took place on 15 January 1959.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\nIn 1955, to support a program which called for 40 squadrons of BOMARC (120 missiles to a squadron for a total of 4,800 missiles), ADC reached a decision on the location of these 40 squadrons and suggested operational dates for each. The sequence was as follows: ... l. [[McGuire Air Force Base#Air Defense Command|McGuire]] 1/60 2. [[Suffolk County Air Force Base Missile Annex|Suffolk]] 2/60 3.

The 46th ADMS was assigned to the [[Eastern Air Defense Sector|New York Air Defense Sector]] at [[McGuire Air Force Base]], New Jersey. The training program, under the [[4751st Air Defense Missile Wing|4751st Air Defense Wing]] used technicians acting as instructors and was established for a four-month duration. Training included missile maintenance; SAGE operations and launch procedures, including the launch of an unarmed missile at Eglin. In September 1959 the squadron assembled at their permanent station, the Bomarc site near McGuire AFB, and trained for operational readiness. The first Bomarc-A were used at McGuire on 19 September 1959 with Kincheloe AFB getting the first operational IM-99Bs. While several of the squadrons replicated earlier fighter interceptor unit numbers, they were all new organizations with no previous historical counterpart.<ref>[http://www.radomes.org/museum/documents/McGuireAFBBOMARCNJ1960NYADShistory.html \"46th Air Defense Missile Squadron.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905004923/http://www.radomes.org/museum/documents/McGuireAFBBOMARCNJ1960NYADShistory.html |date=5 September 2017 }} ''NYADS 1960 Yearbook.''

Ongoing development and reliability problems didn't help, nor did Congressional debate over the missile's usefulness and necessity. In June 1959, the Air Force authorized 16 Bomarc sites with 56 missiles each; the initial five would get the IM-99A with the remainder getting the IM-99B. However, in March 1960, HQ USAF cut deployment to eight sites in the United States and two in Canada.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\n====Bomarc incident====\n{{main|BOMARC Missile Accident Site}}\n\nWithin a year of operations, a Bomarc&nbsp;A with a nuclear warhead caught fire at [[McGuire AFB]] on 7 June 1960 after its on-board helium tank exploded. While the missile's explosives did not detonate, the heat melted the warhead and released plutonium, which the fire crews spread. The Air Force and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] cleaned up the site and covered it with concrete. This was the only major incident involving the weapon system.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/> The site remained in operation for several years following the fire. Since its closure in 1972, the area has remained off limits, primarily due to low levels of plutonium contamination.<ref>Gambardello, Joseph A.

Otherwise the air defense missile squadrons maintained alert while making regular trips to Santa Rosa Island for training and firing practice. After the inactivation of the 4751st ADW(M) on 1 July 1962 and transfer of Hurlburt to [[Tactical Air Command]] for air commando operations the 4751st Air Defense Squadron (Missile) remained at Hurlburt and Santa Rosa Island for training purposes.<ref name=\"Gibson\"/>\n\nIn 1964, the liquid-fueled Bomarc-A sites and squadrons began to be deactivated. The sites at Dow and Suffolk County closed first. The remainder continued to be operational for several more years while the government started dismantling the air defense missile network. Niagara Falls was the first BOMARC B installation to close, in December 1969; the others remained on alert through 1972. In April 1972, the last Bomarc B in U.S. Air Force service was retired at McGuire and the 46th ADMS inactivated <ref name=\"Gibson\"/> and the base was deactivated.<ref name=sand>{{cite news|author1=THOMAS P.

With the passage of time the operational capability of the 1950s-era Bomarc system no longer met modern requirements; the Department of National Defence deemed that the Bomarc missile defense was no longer a viable system, and ordered both squadrons to be stood down in 1972.
