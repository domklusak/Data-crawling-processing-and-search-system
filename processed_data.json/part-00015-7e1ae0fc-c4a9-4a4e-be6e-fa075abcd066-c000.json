It was widely used in a new generation of [[personal computer]]s with [[graphical user interface]]s, including the [[Macintosh 128K]], [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[X68000|Sharp X68000]]. The 1988 [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]] console is powered by a 68000.\n\nLater processors in the [[Motorola 68000 series]], beginning with the [[Motorola 68020]], use full 32-bit ALUs and have full 32-bit address and data buses, speeding up 32-bit operations and allowing full 32-bit addressing rather than the 24-bit addressing of the 68000 and [[Motorola 68010]] or the 31-bit addressing of the [[Motorola 68012]].

These were generally modeled on [[minicomputer]] platforms like the [[Data General Nova]] or [[PDP-8]]. Based on the [[semiconductor manufacturing]] processes of the era, these were often multi-chip solutions like the [[National Semiconductor]] [[IMP-16]], or the single-chip PACE that had issues with speed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HljLwCWYERQC&pg=PA336|title=Encyclopedia of Microcomputers – Evolution of Computerized Maintenance Management to Generation of Random Numbers|last1=Kent|first1=Allen|author1-link=Allen Kent|last2=Williams|first2=James G.|publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]]|date=1991|access-date=2022-07-29|volume=7|page=336|isbn=0-8247-2706-1|archive-date=July 29, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220729234026/https://books.google.com/books?id=HljLwCWYERQC&pg=PA336|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the sales prospects for the 6800 dimming, but still cash-flush from the engine control sales, in late 1976 Colin Crook, Operations Manager, began considering how to successfully win future sales. They were aware that [[Intel]] was working on a 16-bit extension of their [[Intel 8080|8080]] series, which would emerge as the [[Intel 8086]], and had heard rumors of a 16-bit [[Zilog Z80]], which became the [[Zilog Z8000|Z8000]]. These would use new design techniques that would eliminate the problems seen in earlier 16-bit systems.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=5}}\n\nMotorola knew that if they launched a product similar to the 8086, within 10% of its capabilities, Intel would kill them in the market. In order to compete, they set themselves the goal of being two times as powerful at the same cost, or one-half the cost with the same performance. Crook decided that they would attack the high-end of the market with the most powerful processor on the market.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=5}} Another 16-bit would not do, their design would have to be bigger, and that meant having some 32-bit features.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=9}} Crook had decided on this approach by the end of 1976.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=5}}\n\n===MACSS===\nCrook formed the Motorola Advanced Computer System on Silicon (MACSS) project to build the design and hired Tom Gunter to be its principal architect. Gunter began forming his team in January 1977.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=6}} The performance goal was set at 1 [[million instructions per second]] (MIPS). They wanted the design to not only win back microcomputer vendors like [[Apple Computer]] and [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]], but also minicomputer companies like [[National Cash Register|NCR]] and [[AT&T]].{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=6}}\n\nThe team decided to abandon an attempt at [[backward compatibility]] with the 6800, as they felt the 8-bit designs were too limited to be the basis for new designs. The new system was influenced by the [[PDP-11]], the most popular minicomputer design of the era.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=8}} At the time, a key concept in minis was the concept of an [[orthogonal instruction set]], in which every operation was allowed to work on any sort of data. To feed the correct data into the internal units, MACSS made extensive use of [[microcode]], essentially small programs in [[read only memory]] that gathered up the required data, performed the operations and wrote out the results. MACSS was among the first to use this technique in a microprocessor.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=7}}<ref name=\"Andersson 2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eetimes.com/the-microprocessor-revolution/2|title=The Microprocessor (R)evolution|last=Andersson|first=Sven|work=[[EE Times]]|date=2014-03-24|access-date=2022-07-29|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220729222733/https://www.eetimes.com/the-microprocessor-revolution/2|archive-date=2022-07-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere was a large amount of support hardware for the 6800 that would remain useful, things like [[UART]]s and similar interfacing systems. For this reason, the new design retained a [[Protocol (computing)|bus protocol]] compatibility mode for existing 6800 peripheral devices.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eeRdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA264|title=Servicing Personal Computers|edition=Third|last=Tooley|first=Michael|publisher=[[Newnes (publisher)|Newnes]]|date=1992|access-date=2022-07-29|pages=264–265|isbn=0-7506-0374-7|archive-date=July 29, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220729234027/https://books.google.com/books?id=eeRdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA264|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Andersson 2\"/>\n\nA chip with 32 data and 32 addressing pins would require 64 pins, plus more for power and other features. At the time, 64-pin [[dual inline package]] (DIP)s were \"large, heavy-cost\" systems and \"just terrible\", making that the largest they could consider. To make it fit, Crook selected a hybrid design, with a 32-bit [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) but 16-bit components implementing it, like the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU).{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=6}} The external interface was reduced to 16 data pins and 24 for addresses, allowing it all to fit in a 64-pin package. This became known as the \"Texas Cockroach\".{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=9}}{{efn|Hybrid designs of this sort were already common in the minicomputer field. The Data General Nova was a 16-bit design implemented using 4-bit ALUs.}}\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Motorola's MOS design techniques had become less advanced than their competition, and their fabrication lines at times struggled with low yields. By the late-1970s, the company had entered a technology exchange program with [[Hitachi]], dramatically improving their production capabilities. As part of this, a new fab, MOS-8, was built using the latest 5-inch [[semiconductor wafer|wafer]] sizes and Intel's [[HMOS]] process with a 3.5&nbsp;[[µm]] feature size.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=10}} This was an investment aimed at catching the competition: even upstart semiconductor companies such as Zilog and [[MOS Technology]] had introduced CPUs fabricated on [[Depletion and enhancement modes|depletion-mode]] [[NMOS logic]] before Motorola did. In fact, Motorola may have substantially lagged contemporaries in phasing out enhancement mode and metal gate, with the director of 68k-series products Tom Gunter recollecting that the 68000 itself had to succeed despite initially adopting a metal-gate design.{{sfn|Oral|2007|pp=9-11}} Though the point about playing catch-up is clear, this could not have been an entirely accurate summary because Motorola's 1976 datasheets, predating the inception of the MACCS project, denote the majority of its 6800 family in silicon-gate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/components/motorola/6800/MC6800_Microcomputer_System_Design_Data_1976.pdf|title=M6800 Microcomputer System Design Data|work=[[Motorola]]|date=1976|access-date=2023-04-17|page=21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230418042432/http://www.bitsavers.org/components/motorola/6800/MC6800_Microcomputer_System_Design_Data_1976.pdf|archive-date=2023-04-18|url-status=live}}</ref> \nIndeed, Gunter's own 1979 article introducing the 68000 highlighted it as a silicon-gate depletion-mode HMOS design.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1658617|title=Microsystems a Microprocessor Architecture for a Changing World: The Motorola 68000|journal=Computer|date=1979|access-date=2023-04-17|author=Stritter and Gunter|volume=12|issue=2|pages=43–52 |doi=10.1109/MC.1979.1658617 |s2cid=15893310 }}</ref>  Whatever the degree of Motorola's process and manufacturing deficits in the early days, the team was undeterred and would not compromise in its pursuit of a microprocessor with industry-leading performance.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=11}}\n\n===Sampling and production===\nFormally introduced in September 1979,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://processortimeline.info/ |author=Ken Polsson |title=Chronology of Microprocessors |publisher=Processortimeline.info |access-date=2013-09-27 |archive-date=August 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819200821/http://processortimeline.info/ |url-status=live }}</ref> initial samples were released in February 1980, with production chips available over the counter in November.<ref name=\"easy68k\">{{citation |url=http://www.easy68k.com/paulrsm/dg/dg29.htm |title=DTACK GROUNDED, The Journal of Simple 68000/16081 Systems |issue=29 |date=March 1984 |page=9 |access-date=October 31, 2011 |archive-date=March 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310103652/http://www.easy68k.com/paulrsm/dg/dg29.htm |url-status=live }}.</ref> Initial speed grades are 4, 6, and 8&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]]. 10&nbsp;MHz chips became available during 1981,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Motorola was the rival to beat, and its 68000 its greatest success |url=https://tekdeeps.com/motorola-was-the-rival-to-beat-and-its-68000-its-greatest-success/ |access-date=13 September 2022 |website=tekdeeps |archive-date=September 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220913122857/https://tekdeeps.com/motorola-was-the-rival-to-beat-and-its-68000-its-greatest-success/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and 12.5&nbsp;MHz chips by June 1982.<ref name=\"easy68k\" /> The 16.67&nbsp;MHz \"12F\" version of the MC68000, the fastest version of the original HMOS chip, was not produced until the late 1980s.\n\nBy the start of 1981, the 68k was making multiple [[design win]]s on the high end, and Gunter began to approach Apple to win their business. At that time, the 68k sold for about $125 in quantity. In meetings with [[Steve Jobs]], Jobs talked about using the 68k in the [[Apple Lisa]], but stated \"the real future is in this product that I'm personally doing. If you want this business, you got to commit that you'll sell it for $15.\"{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=12}} Motorola countered by offering to sell it at $55 at first, then step down to $35, and so on. Jobs agreed, and the [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] moved from the [[Motorola 6809|6809]] to the 68k. The average price eventually reached $14.76.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=12}}\n\n==Variants==\nIn 1982, the 68000 received a minor update to its [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) to support [[virtual memory]] and to conform to the [[Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements]].

A further extended version, which exposes 31&nbsp;bits of the address bus, was also produced in small quantities as the [[Motorola 68012|68012]].\n\nTo support lower-cost systems and control applications with smaller memory sizes, Motorola introduced the 8-bit compatible [[Motorola 68008|MC68008]], also in 1982. This is a 68000 with an 8-bit data bus and a smaller (20-bit) address bus. After 1982, Motorola devoted more attention to the [[Motorola 68020|68020]] and [[Motorola 88000|88000]] projects.\n\n===Second-sourcing===\n[[File:KL Hitachi HD68000.jpg|thumb|[[Hitachi]] HD68000]]\n[[File:KL Thomson TS68000.jpg|thumb|Thomson TS68000]]\n\nSeveral other companies were [[Second source|second-source]] manufacturers of the HMOS 68000.

Toshiba was also a second-source maker of the CMOS 68HC000 (TMP68HC000).\n\nEncrypted variants of the 68000, being the Hitachi FD1089 and FD1094, store decryption keys for opcodes and opcode data in battery-backed memory and were used in certain Sega arcade systems including [[System 16]] to prevent piracy and illegal bootleg games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://segaretro.org/FD1094|title=FD1094 – Sega Retro|website=segaretro.org|date=19 October 2017|access-date=October 27, 2015|archive-date=September 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928185644/http://segaretro.org/FD1094|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===CMOS versions===\n[[File:Motorola MC68HC000LC8-2413.jpg|thumb|Motorola MC68HC000LC8]]\n\nThe 68HC000, the first [[CMOS]] version of the 68000, was designed by Hitachi and jointly introduced in 1985.<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00612F73C5D0C728EDDA00894DD484D81 \"Company Briefs\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114063028/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00612F73C5D0C728EDDA00894DD484D81 |date=November 14, 2007 }}, The New York Times, September 21, 1985, available from TimesSelect (subscription).</ref> Motorola's version is called the MC68HC000, while Hitachi's is the HD68HC000. The 68HC000 offers speeds of 8–20&nbsp;MHz. Except for using CMOS circuitry, it behaved identically to the HMOS MC68000, but the change to CMOS greatly reduced its power consumption. The original HMOS MC68000 consumed around 1.35&nbsp;[[watt]]s at an ambient temperature of 25&nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]], regardless of clock speed, while the MC68HC000 consumed only 0.13&nbsp;watts at 8&nbsp;MHz and 0.38&nbsp;watts at 20&nbsp;MHz. (Unlike CMOS circuits, HMOS still draws power when idle, so power consumption varies little with clock rate.) Apple selected the 68HC000 for use in the [[Macintosh Portable]].\n\nMotorola replaced the MC68008 with the MC68HC001 in 1990.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=68HC001 obsoletes 68008|magazine=[[Microprocessor Report]]|date=June 20, 1990}}</ref> This chip resembles the 68HC000 in most respects, but its data bus can operate in either 16-bit or 8-bit mode, depending on the value of an input pin at reset. Thus, like the 68008, it can be used in systems with cheaper 8-bit memories.\n\nThe later evolution of the 68000 focused on more modern [[embedded control]] applications and on-chip peripherals. The '''68EC000''' chip and SCM68000 core remove the M6800 peripheral bus, and exclude the MOVE from SR instruction from user mode programs, making the 68EC000 and 68SEC000 the only 68000 CPUs not 100% object code compatible with previous 68000 CPUs when run in User Mode. When run in Supervisor Mode, there is no difference.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Motorola streamlines 68000 family; \"EC\" versions of 68000, '020, '030, and '040, plus low-end 68300 chip\"|magazine=Microprocessor Report|date=April 17, 1991}}</ref> In 1996, Motorola updated the standalone core with fully static circuitry, drawing only 2&nbsp;[[µW]] in low-power mode, calling it the MC68SEC000.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://mot-sps.com/press/html/PR961118B.html |title=Motorola reveals MC68SEC000 processor for low power embedded applications |date=November 18, 1996 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970328231731/http://mot-sps.com/press/html/PR961118B.html |archive-date=March 28, 1997 | publisher=Motorola}}</ref>\n\nMotorola ceased production of the HMOS MC68000, as well as the MC68008, MC68010, MC68330, and MC68340 in on June 1, 1996,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.datasheetarchive.com/pdf/download.php?id=f289b43a955580968b84c0f71b9c1bbf874b61|format=PDF|title=HIPPO Q495|journal=High-Performance Internal Product Portfolio Overview|publisher=[[Motorola]]|date=Fourth Quarter 1995|issue=10|access-date=July 29, 2022|archive-date=September 14, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220914195057/https://www.datasheetarchive.com/pdf/download.php?id=f289b43a955580968b84c0f71b9c1bbf874b61|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.m68k/browse_frm/thread/ab9a8520ee794d85/cedb5e4f449f346c comp.sys.m68k Usenet posting] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114093111/http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.m68k/browse_frm/thread/ab9a8520ee794d85/cedb5e4f449f346c |date=November 14, 2007 }}, May 16, 1995; also see other posts in thread.

The board remained in use in US colleges as a tool for learning assembly programming until the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSYLAAAAQBAJ&dq=motorola+68000+ecbecb&pg=PA485 |title=The Atmel AVR Microcontroller: MEGA and XMEGA in Assembly and C |date=14 January 2013 |publisher=Han-Way Huang |isbn=978-1285500089 |access-date=November 18, 2021 |archive-date=April 10, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410184603/https://books.google.com/books?id=TSYLAAAAQBAJ&dq=motorola+68000+ecbecb&pg=PA485 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAt its introduction, the 68000 was first used in high-priced systems, including multiuser [[microcomputer]]s like the [[Wicat Systems|WICAT]] 150,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=254 |title=museum ~ WICAT 150 |publisher=Old-computers.com |access-date=2013-09-27 |archive-date=October 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012060639/http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=254 |url-status=live }}</ref> early [[Alpha Microsystems]] computers, [[SAGE Computer Technology|Sage II / IV]], [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]] 6000 / [[TRS-80 Model 16]], and [[Fortune 32:16]]; single-user [[workstation]]s such as [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[HP 9000]] Series 200 systems, the first [[Apollo/Domain]] systems, [[Sun Microsystems]]' [[Sun-1]], and the [[Corvus Concept]]; and graphics [[Computer terminal|terminals]] like [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[VAXstation]] 100 and [[Silicon Graphics]]' IRIS 1000 and 1200. [[Unix]] systems rapidly moved to the more capable later generations of the 68k line, which remained popular in that market throughout the 1980s.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, falling production cost made the 68000 viable for use in [[personal computer]]s starting with the [[Apple Lisa]] and [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]], and followed by the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[X68000]].\n\nThe [[Sinclair QL]] microcomputer, along with its derivatives, such as the ICL [[One Per Desk]] business terminal, was the most commercially important utilisation of the 68008. Helix Systems (in Missouri, United States) designed an extension to the [[SWTPC]] [[SS-50 bus]], the SS-64, and produced systems built around the 68008 processor.\n\nWhile the adoption of RISC and x86 displaced the 68000 series as desktop/workstation CPU, the processor found substantial use in [[Embedded system|embedded]] applications. By the early 1990s, quantities of 68000 CPUs could be purchased for less than 30&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]] per part.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}\n\nThe 68000 also saw great success as an embedded controller. As early as 1981, [[laser printer]]s such as the Imagen Imprint-10 were controlled by external boards equipped with the 68000. The first [[HP LaserJet]], introduced in 1984, came with a built-in 8&nbsp;MHz 68000. Other printer manufacturers adopted the 68000, including Apple with its introduction of the [[LaserWriter]] in 1985, the first [[PostScript]] laser printer. The 68000 continued to be widely used in printers throughout the rest of the 1980s, persisting well into the 1990s in low-end printers.\n\nThe 68000 was successful in the field of industrial control systems. Among the systems benefited from having a 68000 or derivative as their microprocessor were families of [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs) manufactured by [[Allen-Bradley]], [[Texas Instruments]] and subsequently, following the acquisition of that division of TI, by [[Siemens]]. Users of such systems do not accept product obsolescence at the same rate as domestic users, and it is entirely likely that despite having been installed over 20 years ago, many 68000-based controllers will continue in reliable service well into the 21st century.\n\nIn a number of [[Digital storage oscilloscope|digital oscilloscopes]] from the 80s,<ref>Philips PM3320 250 MS/s Dual Channel Digital Storage Oscilloscope Service Manual, Section 8.6, ordering code 4822 872 05315.</ref> the 68000 has been used as a waveform display processor; some models including the [[LeCroy Corporation|LeCroy]] 9400/9400A<ref>LeCroy 9400/9400A Digital Oscilloscope Service Manual, Section 1.1.1.3 Microprocessor, August 1990.</ref> also use the 68000 as a waveform math processor (including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two waveforms/references/waveform memories), and some digital oscilloscopes using the 68000 (including the 9400/9400A) can also perform [[fast Fourier transform]] functions on a waveform.\n\nThe [[Freescale 683XX|683XX]] microcontrollers, based on the 68000 architecture, are used in networking and telecom equipment, television set-top boxes, laboratory and medical instruments, and even handheld calculators. The MC68302 and its derivatives have been used in many telecom products from Cisco, 3com, Ascend, Marconi, Cyclades and others. Past models of the [[Palm (PDA)|Palm]] PDAs and the [[Handspring Visor]] used the [[Freescale DragonBall|DragonBall]], a derivative of the 68000. [[AlphaSmart]] used the DragonBall family in later versions of its portable word processors. [[Texas Instruments]] used the 68000 in its high-end graphing calculators, the [[TI-89]] and [[TI-92]] series and [[TI-92#Voyage 200|Voyage 200]].\n\nA modified version of the 68000 formed the basis of the [[PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes|IBM XT/370]] hardware emulator of the System 370 processor.\n\n===Video games===\n[[Video game]] manufacturers used the 68000 as the backbone of many [[arcade game]]s and home [[Video game console|game consoles]]: Atari's ''[[Food Fight (video game)|Food Fight]]'', from 1982, was one of the first 68000-based arcade games. Others included [[Sega]]'s [[Sega System 16|System 16]], [[Capcom]]'s [[CP System]] and [[CP System II|CPS-2]], and [[SNK]]'s [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo Geo]]. By the late 1980s, the 68000 was inexpensive enough to power home game consoles, such as Sega's [[Sega Genesis]] console and also the [[Sega CD]] attachment for it (A Sega CD system has three CPUs, two of them 68000s). The multi-processor [[Atari Jaguar]] console from 1993 used a 68000 as a support chip, although some developers used it as the primary processor due to familiarity. The [[Sega Saturn]] console used the 68000 as a sound co-processor. In October 1995, the 68000 made it into a [[handheld game console]], Sega's [[Genesis Nomad]], as its CPU.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Retroinspection: Sega Nomad|last=Hunt|first=Stuart|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|date=2009-10-06|issue=69|page=47}}</ref>\n\nCertain arcade games (such as ''[[Steel Gunner]]'' and others based on [[Namco System 2]]) use a dual 68000 CPU configuration,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/nonamemame/source/browse/src/drivers/namcos2.c?r=7abd17923eae3f6ed6cc76cfbd970157b2efd882|title=Google Code Archive - Long-term storage for Google Code Project Hosting.|website=code.google.com|access-date=2016-01-15|archive-date=September 14, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220914195057/https://code.google.com/archive/p/nonamemame/source|url-status=live}}</ref> and systems with a triple 68000 CPU configuration also exist (such as ''[[Galaxy Force (video game)|Galaxy Force]]'' and others based on the Sega Y Board),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/jv4779/openlase-mame/blob/master/xmame-0.106/src/drivers/segaybd.c|title=openlase-mame/segaybd.c at master - jv4779/openlase-mame|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-01-15|archive-date=December 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211209051124/https://github.com/jv4779/openlase-mame/blob/master/xmame-0.106/src/drivers/segaybd.c|url-status=live}}</ref> along with a quad 68000 CPU configuration, which has been used by [[Jaleco]] (one 68000 for sound has a lower clock rate compared to the other 68000 CPUs)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/p/nonamemame/source/browse/src/drivers/cischeat.c?r=edbd288e773e4cdc2ef6d90ca6f6f5984b1574f4&spec=svne6ae7fccf21deeb280b1f25be7ea66ae6fdeb29e |title=Google Code Archive - Long-term storage for Google Code Project Hosting |website=code.google.com |access-date=2016-01-15 |archive-date=September 14, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220914195058/https://code.google.com/archive/p/nonamemame/source |url-status=live }}</ref> for games such as ''[[Big Run (arcade game)|Big Run]]'' and ''[[Cisco Heat]]'';

These 24 lines can therefore address 16 MB of physical memory with byte resolution. Address storage and computation uses 32 bits internally; however, the 8 high-order address bits are ignored due to the physical lack of device pins. This allows it to run software written for a logically flat 32-bit [[address space]], while accessing only a 24-bit physical address space. <!-- \"By modern definition (ref?) this meant that the 68000 was a 32-bit microprocessor.\" That means an 8080 or 6809 is a 16-bit processor? Most definitions of bitness use internal bus size or instruction types.  The 68000 used unparalleled 16 bit internal bus and 3 16-bit ALU: 2 ALUs for Data Registers and 1 ALU for Addresses.--><!-- The 68000 could be described as 32/32-bit CPU, having 32-bit registers and a 32-bit logical address space; likewise, the 8080 is an 8/16-bit (or 8/16/16-bit) CPU, and the 6502/6800/6809 are 8/16-bit CPUs. --> Motorola's intent with the internal 32-bit address space was forward compatibility, making it feasible to write 68000 software that would take full advantage of later 32-bit implementations of the 68000 instruction set.<ref name=\"Starnes\" />\n\nHowever, this did not prevent programmers from writing forward incompatible software. \"24-bit\" software that discarded the upper address byte, or used it for purposes other than addressing, could fail on 32-bit 68000 implementations. For example, early (pre-7.0) versions of Apple's [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] used the high byte of memory-block master pointers to hold flags such as ''locked'' and ''purgeable''. Later versions of the OS moved the flags to a nearby location, and Apple began shipping computers which had \"[[32-bit clean]]\" ROMs beginning with the release of the 1989 Mac IIci.\n\nThe 68000 family stores multi-byte integers in memory in [[endianness|big-endian]] order.\n\n===Internal registers===\nThe [[Central processing unit|CPU]] has eight 32-bit general-purpose data [[processor register|registers]] (D0-D7), and eight address registers (A0-A7). The last address register is the [[stack (data structure)|stack pointer]], and assemblers accept the label SP as equivalent to A7. This was a good number of registers at the time in many ways. It was small enough to allow the 68000 to respond quickly to [[interrupt]]s (even in the worst case where all 8 data registers D0–D7 and 7 address registers A0–A6 needed to be saved, 15 registers in total), and yet large enough to make most calculations fast, because they could be done entirely within the processor without keeping any partial results in memory. (Note that an exception routine in supervisor mode can also save the user stack pointer A7, which would total 8 address registers. However, the dual stack pointer (A7 and supervisor-mode A7') design of the 68000 makes this normally unnecessary, except when a task switch is performed in a multitasking system.)\n\nHaving the two types of registers allows one 32-bit address and one 16-bit data calculation to take place at the same time. This results in reduced instruction execution time as addresses and data can be processed in parallel.<ref name=\"Starnes\" />\n\n===Status register===\nThe 68000 has a 16-bit status register. The upper 8 bits is the system byte, and modification of it is privileged. The lower 8 bits is the user byte, also known as the condition code register (CCR), and modification of it is not privileged. The 68000 comparison, arithmetic, and logic operations modify condition codes to record their results for use by later conditional jumps. The condition code bits are \"carry\" (C), \"overflow\" (V), \"zero\" (Z), \"negative\" (N) and \"extend\" (X). The \"extend\" (X) flag deserves special mention, because it is separate from the [[carry flag]]. This permits the extra bit from arithmetic, logic, and shift operations to be separated from the carry [[multiprecision arithmetic]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BUEEgvMcyUC&pg=PA149|title=Assembly Language and Systems Programming for the M68000 Family|edition=Second|last1=Ford|first1=William|last2=Topp|first2=William R.|publisher=[[Jones and Bartlett Publishers]]|date=1997|access-date=2022-07-29|pages=149–151|isbn=0-7637-0357-5|archive-date=July 29, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220729234028/https://books.google.com/books?id=2BUEEgvMcyUC&pg=PA149|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Instruction set===\nThe designers attempted to make the assembly language [[Orthogonal instruction set|orthogonal]]. That is, instructions are divided into operations and [[Addressing mode|address modes]], and almost all address modes are available for almost all instructions. There are 56 instructions and a minimum instruction size of 16 bits. Many instructions and addressing modes are longer to include more address or mode bits.\n\n===Privilege levels===\nThe CPU, and later the whole family, implements two levels of privilege. User mode gives access to everything except privileged instructions such as interrupt level controls.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |year=1993 |url=https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/MC68000UM.pdf |title=M68000 8-/16-/32-Bit Microprocessors User's Manual Ninth Edition |publisher=Motorola |at=p. 6-2 |access-date=February 28, 2022 |archive-date=April 14, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220414231314/https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/MC68000UM.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Supervisor privilege gives access to everything. An interrupt always becomes supervisory. The supervisor bit is stored in the status register, and is visible to user programs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAn advantage of this system is that the supervisor level has a separate stack pointer. This permits a [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] system to use very small stacks for tasks, because the designers do not have to allocate the memory required to hold the stack frames of a maximum stack-up of interrupts.\n\n===Interrupts===<!-- This section is linked from [[Guru Meditation]] -->\nThe CPU recognizes seven [[interrupt]] levels. Levels 1 through 5 are strictly prioritized. That is, a higher-numbered interrupt can always interrupt a lower-numbered interrupt. In the status register, a privileged instruction allows setting the current minimum interrupt level, blocking lower or equal priority interrupts. For example, if the interrupt level in the status register is set to 3, higher levels from 4 to 7 can cause an exception. Level 7 is a level triggered [[non-maskable interrupt]] (NMI). Level 1 can be interrupted by any higher level. Level 0 means no interrupt. The level is stored in the status register, and is visible to user-level programs.\n\nHardware interrupts are signalled to the CPU using three inputs that encode the highest pending interrupt priority. A separate encoder is usually required to encode the interrupts, though for systems that do not require more than three hardware interrupts it is possible to connect the interrupt signals directly to the encoded inputs at the cost of more software complexity. The interrupt controller can be as simple as a [[7400-series integrated circuits|74LS148]] priority encoder, or may be part of a [[Very Large Scale Integration|very large-scale integration]] (VLSI) peripheral chip such as the MC68901 Multi-Function Peripheral (used in the [[Atari ST]] range of computers and [[Sharp X68000]]), which also provides a [[UART]], timer, and parallel I/O.\n\nThe \"exception table\" ([[interrupt vector table]] interrupt vector addresses) is fixed at addresses 0 through 1023, permitting 256 32-bit vectors. The first vector (RESET) consists of two vectors, namely the starting stack address, and the starting code address. Vectors 3 through 15 are used to report various errors: [[bus error]], address error, [[illegal instruction]], [[zero division]], CHK and CHK2 vector, privilege violation (to block [[privilege escalation]]), and some reserved vectors that became line 1010 emulator, line 1111 emulator, and hardware [[breakpoint]]. Vector 24 starts the '''real''' interrupts: [[spurious interrupt]] (no hardware acknowledgement), and level 1 through level 7 autovectors, then the 16&nbsp;TRAP vectors, then some more reserved vectors, then the user defined vectors.\n\nSince the starting code address vector must always be valid on reset, systems commonly included some nonvolatile memory (e.g. [[Read-only memory|ROM]]) starting at address zero to contain the vectors and [[booting|bootstrap]] code. However, for a general purpose system it is desirable for the operating system to be able to change the vectors at runtime. This was often accomplished by either pointing the vectors in ROM to a [[Branch table|jump table]] in [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], or through use of [[bank switching]] to allow the ROM to be replaced by RAM at runtime.\n\nThe 68000 does not meet the [[Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements]] for full processor virtualization because it has a single unprivileged instruction, \"MOVE from SR\", which allows user-mode software read-only access to a small amount of privileged state. The 68EC000 and 68SEC000, which are later derivatives of the 68000, do meet the requirements as the \"MOVE from SR\" instruction is privileged. The same change was introduced on the 68010 and later CPUs.\n\nThe 68000 is also unable to easily support [[virtual memory]], which requires the ability to trap and recover from a failed memory access. The 68000 does provide a bus error exception which can be used to trap, but it does not save enough processor state to resume the faulted instruction once the operating system has handled the exception. Several companies did succeed in making 68000-based Unix workstations with virtual memory that worked by using two 68000 chips running in parallel on different phased clocks. When the \"leading\" 68000 encountered a bad memory access, extra hardware would interrupt the \"main\" 68000 to prevent it from also encountering the bad memory access. This interrupt routine would handle the virtual memory functions and restart the \"leading\" 68000 in the correct state to continue properly synchronized operation when the \"main\" 68000 returned from the interrupt.\n\nThese problems were fixed in the next major revision of the 68k architecture with the release of the MC68010. The Bus Error and Address Error exceptions push a large amount of internal state onto the supervisor stack in order to facilitate recovery, and the \"MOVE from SR\" instruction was made privileged. A new unprivileged \"MOVE from CCR\" instruction is provided for use in its place by user mode software; an operating system can trap and emulate user mode \"MOVE from SR\" instructions if desired.\n\n==Instruction set details==\nThe standard [[addressing mode]]s are:\n\n*Register direct\n**data register, e.g. \"D0\"\n**address register, e.g. \"A0\"\n*Register indirect\n**Simple address, e.g. (A0)\n**Address with post-increment, e.g. (A0)+\n**Address with pre-decrement, e.g. −(A0)\n**Address with a 16-bit signed offset, e.g. 16(A0)\n**Register indirect with index register & 8-bit signed offset e.g. 8(A0,D0) or 8(A0,A1)\n*:Note that for (A0)+ and −(A0), the actual increment or decrement value is dependent on the operand size: a byte access adjusts the address register by 1, a word by 2, and a long by 4.\n*PC (program counter) relative with displacement\n**Relative 16-bit signed offset, e.g. 16(PC). This mode was very useful for position-independent code.\n**Relative with 8-bit signed offset with index, e.g. 8(PC,D2)\n*Absolute memory location\n**Either a number, e.g. \"$4000\", or a symbolic name translated by the assembler\n**Most 68000 assemblers used the \"$\" symbol for [[hexadecimal]], instead of \"0x\" or a trailing H.\n**There are 16 and 32-bit versions of this addressing mode\n*Immediate mode\n**Data stored in the instruction, e.g. \"#400\"\n*Quick immediate mode\n**3-bit unsigned (or 8-bit signed with moveq) with value stored in opcode\n**In addq and subq, 0 is the equivalent to 8\n**e.g. moveq #0,d0 was quicker than clr.l d0 (though both made D0 equal to 0)\n\nPlus: access to the [[status register]], and, in later models, other special registers.\n\nMost instructions have dot-letter suffixes, permitting operations to occur on 8-bit bytes (\".b\"), 16-bit words (\".w\"), and 32-bit longs (\".l\").\n\nLike many CPUs of its era the cycle timing of some instructions varied depending on the source operand(s). For example, the unsigned multiply instruction takes (38+2n) clock cycles to complete where 'n' is equal to the number of bits set in the operand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldwww.nvg.ntnu.no/amiga/MC680x0_Sections/timstandard.HTML|title=Standard Instruction Execution Times|website=oldwww.nvg.ntnu.no|access-date=August 4, 2017|archive-date=September 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909080206/http://oldwww.nvg.ntnu.no/amiga/MC680x0_Sections/timstandard.HTML|url-status=live}}</ref> To create a function that took a fixed cycle count required the addition of extra code after the multiply instruction. This would typically consume extra cycles for each bit that wasn't set in the original multiplication operand.\n\nMost instructions are '''[[wikt:dyadic|dyadic]]''', that is, the operation has a source, and a destination, and the destination is changed. Notable instructions are:\n\n*Arithmetic: ADD, SUB, MULU (unsigned multiply), MULS (signed multiply), DIVU, DIVS, NEG (additive negation), and CMP (a sort of comparison done by subtracting the arguments and setting the status bits, without storing the result)\n*[[Binary-coded decimal]] arithmetic: ABCD, NBCD, and SBCD\n*Logic: EOR (exclusive or), AND, NOT (logical not), OR (inclusive or)\n*Shifting: (logical, i.e. right shifts put zero in the most-significant bit) LSL, LSR, ([[arithmetic shift]]s, i.e. sign-extend the most-significant bit) ASR, ASL, (rotates through eXtend and not) ROXL, ROXR, ROL, ROR\n*[[Bit test and manipulation]] in memory or data register: BSET (set to 1), BCLR (clear to 0), BCHG (invert) and BTST (no change). All of these instructions first test the destination bit and set (clear) the CCR Z bit if the destination bit is 0 (1), respectively.\n*[[Multiprocessing]] control: TAS, [[test-and-set]], performed an indivisible bus operation, permitting [[semaphore (programming)|semaphore]]s to be used to synchronize several processors sharing a single memory\n*Flow of control: JMP (jump), JSR (jump to subroutine), BSR (relative address jump to subroutine), RTS (return from [[subroutine]]), RTE (return from [[Interrupt|exception]], i.e. an interrupt), TRAP (trigger a software exception similar to software interrupt), CHK (a conditional software exception)\n*Branch: Bcc (where the \"cc\" specified one of 14 tests of the condition codes in the status register: equal, greater than, less-than, carry, and most combinations and logical inversions, available from the status register). The remaining two possible conditions (always true and always false) have separate instruction mnemonics, BRA (branch always), and BSR (branch to subroutine). \n*Decrement-and-branch: DBcc (where \"cc\" was as for the branch instructions), which, provided the condition was '''false''', decremented the low word of a D-register and, if the result was not -1 ($FFFF), branched to a destination. This use of −1 instead of 0 as the terminating value allowed the easy coding of loops that had to do nothing if the count was 0 to start with, with no need for another check before entering the loop. This also facilitated nesting of DBcc.\n\n==68EC000==\n[[File:KL Motorola 68EC000 PLCC.jpg|thumb|Motorola 68EC000 controller]]\n\nThe 68EC000 is a low-cost version of the 68000 with a slightly different pinout, designed for embedded controller applications. The 68EC000 can have either a [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] or [[16-bit computing|16-bit]] [[bus (computing)|data bus]], switchable at reset.<ref>{{cite web|last=Boys|first=Robert|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/motorola/68k-chips-faq/|title=M68k Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), comp.sys.m68k|date=January 6, 1996|access-date=May 3, 2010|archive-date=July 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180641/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/motorola/68k-chips-faq/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe processors are available in a variety of speeds including 8 and 16&nbsp;[[MHz]] configurations, producing 2,100 and 4,376&nbsp;[[Dhrystone]]s each.

The processor allowed the board to be configured to perform various audio tasks, such as [[MPU-401]] MIDI synthesis or [[Roland MT-32|MT-32]] emulation, without the use of a [[terminate-and-stay-resident program]]. This improved software compatibility, lowered CPU usage, and eliminated host system memory usage.\n\nThe Motorola 68EC000 core was later used in the m68k-based [[Freescale DragonBall|DragonBall]] processors from Motorola/[[Freescale]].\n\nIt also was used as a sound controller in the [[Sega Saturn]] game console and as a controller for the [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[JetDirect]] [[Ethernet]] controller boards for the mid-1990s [[HP LaserJet]] printers.\n\n==Example code==\nThe 68000 [[assembly language|assembly]] code below is for a subroutine named {{code|strtolower}}, which copies a null-terminated string of 8-bit characters to a destination string, converting all alphabetic characters to lower case.\n\n<!--NOTE: This is not intended to be optimized code, but to illustrate the variety of instructions available on the CPU. -->\n<!--NOTE: Opcodes were assembled by hand, so there may be errors. -->\n{|\n|\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\">\n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n        \n             \n                     \n                     \n                     \n00100000          \n00100000  4E56 0000\n00100004  306E 0008\n00100008  326E 000C\n0010000C  1018\n0010000E  0C40 0041\n00100012  6500 000E\n00100016  0C40 005A\n0010001A  6200 0006\n0010001E  0640 0020\n00100022  12C0\n00100024  66E6\n00100026  4E5E\n00100028  4E75\n0010002A\n</syntaxhighlight>\n|\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"tasm\" highlight=\"10\">\n; strtolower:\n; Copy a null-terminated ASCII string, converting\n; all alphabetic characters to lower case.\n;\n; Entry parameters:\n;   (SP+0): Source string address\n;   (SP+4): Target string address\n\n                org     $00100000       ;Start at 00100000\nstrtolower      public\n                link    a6,#0           ;Set up stack frame\n                movea   8(a6),a0        ;A0 = src, from stack\n                movea   12(a6),a1       ;A1 = dst, from stack\nloop            move.b  (a0)+,d0        ;Load D0 from (src), incr src\n                cmpi    #'A',d0         ;If D0 < 'A',\n                blo     copy            ;skip\n                cmpi    #'Z',d0         ;If D0 > 'Z',\n                bhi     copy            ;skip\n                addi    #'a'-'A',d0     ;D0 = lowercase(D0)\ncopy            move.b  d0,(a1)+        ;Store D0 to (dst), incr dst\n                bne     loop            ;Repeat while D0 <> NUL\n                unlk    a6              ;Restore stack frame\n                rts                     ;Return\n                end\n</syntaxhighlight>\n|}\nThe subroutine establishes a [[call frame]] using register A6 as the frame pointer. This kind of [[calling convention]] supports [[reentrancy (computing)|reentrant]] and [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]] code and is typically used by languages like [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]]. The subroutine then retrieves the parameters passed to it ({{code|src}} and {{code|dst}}) from the stack. It then loops, reading an ASCII character (one byte) from the {{code|src}} string, checking whether it is a capital alphabetic character, and if so, converting it into a lower-case character, otherwise leaving it as it is,  then writing the character into the {{code|dst}} string. Finally, it checks whether the character was a [[null character]]; if not, it repeats the loop, otherwise it restores the previous stack frame (and A6 register) and returns. Note that the string pointers (registers A0 and A1) are auto-incremented in each iteration of the loop.\n \nIn contrast, the code below is for a stand-alone function, even on the most restrictive version of AMS for the [[TI-89 series]] of calculators, being kernel-independent, with no values looked up in tables, files or libraries when executing, no system calls, no exception processing, minimal registers to be used, nor the need to save any.

The design team had formerly worked at [[Motorola]] on the [[Motorola 6800]] project; the 6502 is essentially a simplified, less expensive and faster version of that design.\n\nWhen it was introduced in 1975, the 6502 was the least expensive microprocessor on the market by a considerable margin. It initially sold for less than one-sixth the cost of competing designs from larger companies, such as the 6800 or [[Intel 8080]]. Its introduction caused rapid decreases in pricing across the entire processor market. Along with the [[Zilog Z80]], it sparked a series of projects that resulted in the [[home computer]] [[microcomputer revolution|revolution]] of the early 1980s.\n\nPopular [[video game console]]s and home computers of the 1980s and early 1990s, such as the [[Atari 2600]], [[Atari 8-bit family]], [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari Lynx]], [[BBC Micro]] and others, use the 6502 or variations of the basic design. Soon after the 6502's introduction, MOS Technology was purchased outright by [[Commodore International]], who continued to sell the microprocessor and licenses to other manufacturers. In the early days of the 6502, it was [[second source|second-sourced]] by [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] and [[Synertek]], and later licensed to other companies.\n\nIn 1981, the [[Western Design Center]] started development of a [[CMOS]] version, the [[WDC 65C02|65C02]]. This continues to be widely used in [[embedded system]]s, with estimated production volumes in the hundreds of millions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/|title=Western Design Center (WDC) Home of 65xx Microprocessor Technology|website=www.westerndesigncenter.com|access-date=2019-04-08|archive-date=2019-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408025716/http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==History and use==\n\n===Origins at Motorola===\n[[File:Motorola 6800 proto board.jpg|thumb|Motorola 6800 demonstration board built by Chuck Peddle and John Buchanan in 1974]]\nThe 6502 was designed by many of the same engineers that had designed the [[Motorola 6800]] microprocessor family.<ref name=\"MD Dec 1975 6502 Law Suit\">{{Cite journal |title=Motorola Sues MOS Technology |journal=Microcomputer Digest |volume=2 |issue=6 |page=11 |publisher=Microcomputer Associates |location=Cupertino CA |date=December 1975 |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/microcomputerAssociates/Microcomputer_Digest_v02n06_Dec75.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704150106/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/microcomputerAssociates/Microcomputer_Digest_v02n06_Dec75.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 4, 2009}}</ref> Motorola started the 6800 microprocessor project in 1971 with Tom Bennett as the main architect.

At that time, Motorola's new semiconductor fabrication facility in Austin, Texas, was having difficulty producing MOS chips, and mid-1974 was the beginning of a year-long recession in the semiconductor industry. Also, many of the [[Mesa, Arizona]] employees were displeased with the upcoming relocation to [[Austin, Texas]].<ref>Bagnall (2010), p. 11. Peddle's new offer came at an opportune time for the 6800 developers. \"They didn't want to go to Austin, Texas,\" explains Mensch.</ref>\n\nMotorola's Semiconductor Products Division management was overwhelmed with problems and showed no interest in Peddle's low-cost microprocessor proposal. Eventually Peddle was given an official letter telling him to stop working on the system.{{sfn|Interview|2014|loc=54:40}} Peddle responded to the order by informing Motorola that the letter represented an official declaration of \"project abandonment\", and as such, the intellectual property he had developed to that point was now his.{{sfn|Interview|2014|loc=55:50}} In a November 1975 interview, Motorola's Chairman, Robert Galvin, ultimately agreed that Peddle's concept was a good one and that the division missed an opportunity, \"We did not choose the right leaders in the Semiconductor Products division.\" The division was reorganized and the management replaced. The new group vice-president John Welty said, \"The semiconductor sales organization lost its sensitivity to customer needs and couldn't make speedy decisions.\"<ref name=\"Electronics Nov 13 1975\">{{Cite journal |last=Waller |first=Larry |title=Motorola seeks to end skid |journal=Electronics |volume=48 |issue=23 |pages=96–98 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |date=November 13, 1975}} Summary: Semiconductor Products split into two parts, integrated circuits and discrete components. Semiconductor losses for the last four quarters exceeded $30 million. The sales organization lost its sensitivity to customer needs, \"delays in responding to price cuts meant that customers bought elsewhere.\" Technical problems plagued IC production. The troubles are \"not in design, but in chip and die yields.\" Problems have been solved.

The goal of the team was to design and produce a low-cost microprocessor for embedded applications and to target as wide as possible a customer base. This would be possible only if the microprocessor was low cost, and the team set the price goal at {{US$|long=no|5}} in volume.{{sfn|Interview|2014|loc=58:30}} Mensch later stated the goal was not the processor price itself, but to create a set of chips that could sell at {{US$|long=no|20}} to compete with the recently introduced [[Intel 4040]] that sold for {{US$|long=no|29}} in a similar complete chipset.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=IEEE Spectrum |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/q-a-with-co-creator-of-the-6502-processor |title=Q&A With Co-Creator of the 6502 Processor |first=Stephen |last=Cass |date=16 September 2021 |access-date=20 September 2021 |archive-date=20 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210920212955/https://spectrum.ieee.org/q-a-with-co-creator-of-the-6502-processor |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nChips are produced by printing multiple copies of the chip design on the surface of a [[wafer (electronics)|\"wafer\"]], a thin disk of highly pure silicon. Smaller chips can be printed in greater numbers on the same wafer, decreasing their relative price. Additionally, wafers always include some number of tiny physical defects that are scattered across the surface. Any chip printed in that location will fail and has to be discarded. Smaller chips mean any single copy is less likely to be printed on a defect. For both of these reasons, the cost of the final product is strongly dependent on the size of the chip design.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/8223/an-introduction-to-semiconductor-physics-technology-and-industry/3 |website=Anandtech |title=An Introduction to Semiconductor Physics, Technology, and Industry |first=Joshua |last=Ho |date=9 October 2014 |access-date=24 February 2020 |archive-date=24 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224143352/https://www.anandtech.com/show/8223/an-introduction-to-semiconductor-physics-technology-and-industry/3 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe original 6800 chips were intended to be {{val|180|×|180|u=mils}}{{efn|At that time the technical literature would state the length and width of each chip in [[thousandth of an inch|\"mils\"]] (0.001 inch).}} {{val|p=(|4.6|×|4.6|u=mm|s=)}}, but layout was completed at {{val|212|×|212|u=mils}} {{val|p=(|5.4|×|5.4|u=mm|s=)}}, or an area of 29.0&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>.<ref>Motorola 6800 Oral History (2008), p. 10.</ref> For the new design, the cost goal demanded a size goal of {{val|153|×|168|u=mils}} {{val|p=(|3.9|×|4.3|u=mm|s=)}}, or an area of {{val|16.6|u=mm2}}.{{sfn|Cushman|1975|p=40}} Several new techniques would be needed to hit this goal.\n\n===Moving to NMOS===\nThere were two significant advances that arrived in the market just as the 6502 was being designed that provided significant cost reductions. The first was the move to [[depletion-load NMOS]]. The 6800 used an early NMOS process that required three supply voltages, but one of the chip's features was an onboard [[voltage doubler]] that allowed a single +5&nbsp;V supply be used for +5, −5 and +12&nbsp;V internally, as opposed to other chips of the era like the [[Intel 8080]] that required three separate supply pins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpu-world.com/info/Pinouts/8080.html |website=CPU World |title=8080A microprocessor – DIP 40 package |access-date=2020-02-24 |archive-date=2020-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200915164812/http://www.cpu-world.com/info/Pinouts/8080.html |url-status=live}}</ref> While this feature reduced the complexity of the power supply and pin layout, it still required separate power rails to the various gates on the chip, driving up complexity and size. By moving to the new depletion-load design, a single +5&nbsp;V supply was all that was needed, eliminating all of this complexity.{{sfn|Cushman|1975|p=38}}\n\nA further practical advantage was that the clock signal for earlier CPUs had to be strong enough to survive all the dissipation as it traveled through the circuits, which almost always required a separate external chip that could supply a powerful signal. With the reduced power requirements of NMOS, the clock could be moved onto the chip, simplifying the overall computer design. These changes greatly reduced complexity and the cost of implementing a complete system.{{sfn|Cushman|1975|p=38}}\n\nAnother change that was taking place was the introduction of [[projection mask]]ing. Previously, chips were patterned onto the surface of the wafer by placing a [[photomask|mask]] on the surface of the wafer and then shining a bright light on it. The masks often picked up tiny bits of dirt or [[photoresist]] as they were lifted off the chip, causing flaws in those locations on any subsequent masking. With complex designs like CPUs, 5 or 6 such masking steps would be used, and the chance that at least one of these steps would introduce a flaw was very high. In most cases, 90% of such designs were flawed, resulting in a 10% yield. The price of the working examples had to cover the production cost of the 90% that were thrown away.<ref name=milestone>{{cite web |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/moores-law-milestones |title=Moore's Law Milestones |website=IEEE |date=30 April 2015 |access-date=2020-02-24 |archive-date=2020-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224213400/https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/moores-law-milestones |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, [[Perkin-Elmer]] introduced the [[Micralign]] system, which projected an image of the mask on the wafer instead of requiring direct contact. Masks no longer picked up dirt from the wafers and lasted on the order of 100,000 uses rather than 10. This eliminated step-to-step failures and the high flaw rates formerly seen on complex designs. Yields on CPUs immediately jumped from 10% to 60 or 70%. This meant the price of the CPU declined roughly the same amount and the microprocessor suddenly became a commodity device.<ref name=milestone/>\n\nMOS Technology's existing fabrication lines were based on the older PMOS technology, they had not yet begun to work with NMOS when the team arrived. Paivinen promised to have an NMOS line up and running in time to begin the production of the new CPU. He delivered on the promise, the new line was ready by June 1975.<ref>Bagnall (2010), p. 19: \"Paivinen promised Peddle he would have the n-channel process ready. He was true to his word.\"</ref>\n\n===Design notes===\nChuck Peddle, Rod Orgill, and Wil Mathys designed the initial architecture of the new processors. A September 1975 article in ''[[EDN (magazine)|EDN]]'' magazine gives this summary of the design:{{sfn|Cushman|1975|p=36}}\n<blockquote>\nThe MOS Technology 650X family represents a conscious attempt of eight former Motorola employees who worked on the development of the 6800 system to put out a part that would replace and outperform the 6800, yet undersell it. With the benefit of hindsight gained on the 6800 project, the MOS Technology team headed by Chuck Peddle, made the following architectural changes in the Motorola CPU…\n</blockquote>\n\nThe main change in terms of chip size was the elimination of the [[Three-state logic|tri-state drivers]] from the address bus outputs. A three-state bus has states for \"1\", \"0\" and \"high impedance\". The last state is used to allow other devices to access the bus, and is typically used for [[multiprocessing]], or more commonly in these roles, for [[direct memory access]] (DMA). While useful, this feature is very expensive in terms of on-chip circuitry. The 6502 simply removed this feature, in keeping with its design as an inexpensive controller being used for specific tasks and communicating with simple devices. Peddle suggested that anyone that actually required this style of access could implement it with a single [[Multiplexer#List of ICs which provide multiplexing|74158]].{{sfn|Cushman|1975|p=41}}{{efn|One example of such a design was the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of home computers, which used DMA to share memory between the 6502 and the ANTIC video chip. This was implemented with a single flip-flop, which was later built into custom \"Sally\" versions of the 6502 used in these machines.<ref>{{cite book |title=Games vs. Hardware. The History of PC video games: The 80's |first=John |last=Purcaru |date=2014 |page=317}}</ref>}}\n\nThe next major difference was to simplify the registers. To start with, one of the two [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulators]] was removed. General-purpose registers like accumulators have to be accessed by many parts of the instruction decoder, and thus require significant amounts of wiring to move data to and from their storage. Two accumulators makes many coding tasks easier, but costs the chip design itself significant complexity.{{sfn|Cushman|1975|p=36}} Further savings were made by reducing the [[stack register]] from 16 to 8 bits, meaning that the stack could only be 256 bytes long, which was enough for its intended role as a microcontroller.{{sfn|Cushman|1975|p=36}}{{failed verification|date=January 2023}}\n\nThe 16-bit IX [[index register]] was split in two, becoming X and Y. More importantly, the style of access changed; in the 6800, IX held a 16-bit address, which was offset by an 8-bit number supplied with the instruction, the two were added to produce the final address. In the 6502 (and most other contemporary designs), the 16-bit base address was stored in the instruction, and the X or Y was added to it.{{sfn|Cushman|1975|p=41}}\n\nFinally, the instruction set was simplified, freeing up room in the decoder and control logic. Of the original 72 instructions in the 6800, 56 were implemented. Among those removed were instructions that moved data between the 6800's two accumulators, and several branch instructions inspired by the [[PDP-11]], such as the ability to directly compare two numeric values. The 6502 used a simpler system that handled comparisons by performing a subtraction which set the appropriate flags without saving the result, followed by a conditional branch instruction which tested the flags.{{sfn|Cushman|1975|p=41}}\n\nThe chip's high-level design had to be turned into drawings of transistors and interconnects. At MOS Technology, the \"layout\" was a very manual process done with color pencils and [[Vellum|vellum paper]]. The layout consisted of thousands of polygon shapes on six different drawings; one for each layer of the fabrication process. Given the size limits, the entire chip design had to be constantly considered. Mensch and Paivinen worked on the [[instruction decoder]]{{sfn|Interview|2014|loc=1:01:00}} while Mensch, Peddle and Orgill worked on the ALU and registers. A further advance, developed at a party, was a way to share some of the internal wiring to allow the ALU to be reduced in size.{{sfn|Interview|2014|loc=1:02:00}}\n\nIn spite of their best efforts, the final design ended up being 5&nbsp;mils too wide.{{sfn|Interview|2014|loc=1:02:30}} The first 6502 chips were {{nobr|168 × 183 mils}} {{nobr|(4.3 × 4.7 mm)}}, for an area of 19.8&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>. The original version of the processor had no rotate right (ROR) capability, so the instruction was omitted from the original documentation. The next iteration of the design shrank the chip and added the rotate right capability, and ROR was included in revised documentation.<ref name=\"ROR\">[[:File:MCS650x Instruction Set.jpg]]</ref>{{efn|Since the OP code still did something in the original version of the processor, just not a correct ROR instruction, this caused a persistent myth that the original 6502 had a bug in its ROR instruction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pagetable.com/?p=406|title=Measuring the ROR Bug in the Early MOS 6502 – pagetable.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.applefritter.com/content/how-test-ceramic-6502-ror-bug | title=How to test a ceramic 6502 for the ROR bug? &#124; Applefritter }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk_QC1eU0Fg | title=The 6502 Rotate Right Myth | website=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>}}\n\n===Introducing the 6501 and 6502===\n[[File:MOS 6501 6502 Ad Sept 1975.jpg|thumb|Introductory advertisement for the MOS Technology MCS6501 and MCS6502 microprocessors]]\n\nMOS would introduce two microprocessors based on the same underlying design: the 6501 would plug into the same socket as the Motorola 6800, while the 6502 re-arranged the pinout to support an on-chip clock oscillator. Both would work with other support chips designed for the 6800. They would not run 6800 software because they had a different instruction set, different registers, and mostly different addressing modes.<ref>Stanford University, Silicon Genesis project: videotaped oral history interview of Willam Mensch</ref> Rod Orgill was responsible for the 6501 design; he had assisted John Buchanan at Motorola on the 6800. Bill Mensch did the 6502; he was the designer of the 6820 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA) at Motorola. Harry Bawcom, Mike Janes and Sydney-Anne Holt helped with the layout.\n\nMOS Technology's microprocessor introduction was different from the traditional months-long product launch. The first run of a new integrated circuit is normally used for internal testing and shared with select customers as \"engineering samples\". These chips often have a minor design defect or two that will be corrected before production begins. Chuck Peddle's goal was to sell the first run 6501 and 6502 chips to the attendees at the [[Western Electronics Show and Convention|WESCON]] trade show in San Francisco beginning on September 16, 1975. Peddle was a very effective spokesman and the MOS Technology microprocessors were extensively covered in the trade press. One of the earliest was a full-page story on the MCS6501 and MCS6502 microprocessors in the July 24, 1975 issue of ''Electronics'' magazine.<ref name=\"Electronics July 24, 1975\">{{Cite journal |title=Microprocessor line offers 4, 8, 16 bits |journal=Electronics |volume=48 |issue=15 |page=118 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |date=July 24, 1975}} The article covers the 6501 and 6502 plus the 28-pin versions that would only address 4K of memory.

They rented the MacArthur Suite at the [[Westin St. Francis|St. Francis Hotel]] and directed customers there to purchase the processors. At the suite, the processors were stored in large jars to imply that the chips were in production and readily available. The customers did not know the bottom half of each jar contained non-functional chips.<ref>Bagnall (2010), pp. 33–35.</ref> The chips were {{US$|long=no|20}} and {{US$|long=no|25}} while the documentation package was an additional {{US$|long=no|10}}. Users were encouraged to make [[photocopies]] of the documents, an inexpensive way for MOS Technology to distribute product information. The preliminary data sheets listed just 55 instructions excluding the Rotate Right (ROR) instruction which was not supported on these early chips. The reviews in ''Byte'' and ''EDN'' noted the lack of the ROR instruction. The next revision of the layout fixed this problem and the May 1976 datasheet listed 56 instructions. Peddle wanted every interested engineer and hobbyist to have access to the chips and documentation; other semiconductor companies only wanted to deal with \"serious\" customers.

The first to make use of the processor design was the 1977 Atari VCS, later renamed the [[Atari 2600]]. The VCS used a 6502 variant named the [[MOS Technology 6507|6507]], which had fewer pins, so it could address only 8&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of memory. Millions of the Atari consoles would be sold, each with a MOS processor. Another significant use was by the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and Famicom. The 6502 used in the NES was a [[second source]] version by [[Ricoh]], a partial [[system on a chip]], that lacked the [[binary-coded decimal]] mode but added 22 memory-mapped registers and on-die hardware for sound generation, joypad reading, and [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] list [[Direct memory access|DMA]]. Called [[Ricoh 2A03|2A03]] in [[NTSC]] consoles and [[2A07]] in [[PAL]] consoles (the difference being the [[Frequency divider#Digital|clock frequency divider]] ratio and a lookup table for audio sample rates), this processor was produced exclusively for [[Nintendo]].\n\n6502 or variants were used in all of Commodore's [[floppy disk]] [[disk drive|drives]] for all of their 8-bit computers, from the PET line through the Commodore 128D, including the Commodore 64. 8-inch PET drives had two 6502 processors. Atari used the same 6507 used in the Atari VCS for its [[Atari 810|810]] and [[Atari 1050|1050]] disk drives used for all of their 8-bit computer line, from the 400/800 through the XEGS.\n\nIn the 1980s, a popular electronics magazine Elektor/Elektuur used the processor in its microprocessor development board [[Elektor Junior Computer|Junior Computer]].\n\nThe CMOS successor to the 6502, the [[WDC 65C02]], also saw use in home computers and video game consoles. Apple used it in the Apple II line starting with the [[Apple IIc]] and later variants of the [[Apple IIe]] and also offered a kit to upgrade older IIe systems with the new processor.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Apple IIe Enhancement Kit - Peripheral - Computing History |url=https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/54659/Apple-IIe-Enhancement-Kit/ |access-date=2023-10-23 |website=www.computinghistory.org.uk}}</ref> The [[Hudson Soft HuC6280]] chip used in the [[TurboGrafx-16]] was based on a 65C02 core.

This is partly due to a simple state machine implemented by [[Combinational logic|combinational (clockless) logic]] to a greater extent than in many other designs; the two-phase clock (supplying two synchronizations per cycle) could thereby control the machine cycle directly. Typical instructions might take half as many cycles to complete on the 6502 as on contemporary designs. Like most simple CPUs of the era, the dynamic [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] 6502 chip is not sequenced by a [[microcode]] ROM {{clarify|reason=text makes repeated references to instruction decode ROM, e.g. image caption on right|date=May 2021}} but uses a [[Programmable logic array|PLA]] (which occupied about 15% of the chip area) for instruction decoding and sequencing. As in most 8-bit microprocessors, the chip does some limited overlapping of fetching and execution.\n\nThe low clock frequency moderated the speed requirement of memory and peripherals attached to the CPU, as only about 50% of the clock cycle was available for memory access (due to the asynchronous design, this fraction varied strongly among chip versions). This was critical at a time when affordable memory had access times in the range {{nowrap|250–450 ns}}.\n\nBecause the chip only accessed memory during certain parts of the clock cycle, and those cycles were indicated by the PHI2-low clock-out pin, other chips in a system could access memory during those times when the 6502 was off the bus. This was sometimes known as \"hidden access\". This technique was widely used by computer systems; they would use memory capable of access at 2&nbsp;MHz, and then run the CPU at 1&nbsp;MHz. This guaranteed that the CPU and video hardware could interleave their accesses, with a total performance matching that of the memory device.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/12718/how-to-implement-bus-sharing-dma-on-a-6502-system |title=How to implement bus sharing / DMA on a 6502 system |access-date=2020-09-30 |archive-date=2020-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200815134410/https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/12718/how-to-implement-bus-sharing-dma-on-a-6502-system |url-status=live}}</ref> When faster memories became available in the 1980s, newer machines could run at higher clock rates, like the 2&nbsp;MHz CPU in the [[BBC Micro]], and still use the bus sharing techniques.\n\n===Registers===\nLike its precursor, the 6800, the 6502 has very few [[processor register|registers]]. The 6502's registers include one 8-bit [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]] register (A), two 8-bit [[index register]]s (X and Y), 7 [[status register|processor status flag bits]] (P; from bit 7 to bit 0 these are the negative (N), overflow (V), ''reserved'', break (B), decimal (D), interrupt disable (I), zero (Z) and carry (C) flag), an 8-bit [[stack (abstract data type)|stack pointer]] (S), and a 16-bit [[program counter]] (PC).<ref>{{Cite book |title=MOS MICROCOMPUTERS PROGRAMMING MANUAL |publisher=MOS TECHNOLOGY, INC. |date=January 1976 |chapter=PROGRAMMING MODEL MCS650X}}</ref> This compares to a typical design of the same era, the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]], which has eight general-purpose 8-bit registers, which can be combined into four 16-bit ones. The Z80 also had a complete set of alternate registers, which made a total of sixteen general-purpose registers.\n\nIn order to make up somewhat for the lack of registers, the 6502 includes a [[Zero page|''zero-page'']] addressing mode that uses one address byte in the instruction instead of the two needed to address the full {{val|64|u=KB}} of memory. This provides fast access to the first {{val|256|u=bytes}} of RAM by using shorter instructions. Chuck Peddle has said in interviews that the specific intention was to allow these first {{val|256|u=bytes}} of RAM to be used like registers.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe stack address space is [[Wiktionary:Hardwired|hardwired]] to memory page <code>$01</code>, i.e. the address range <code>$0100</code>–<code>$01FF</code> (<code>256</code>–<code>511</code>). Software access to the stack is done via four implied addressing mode instructions, whose functions are to push or pop (pull) the accumulator or the processor status register. The same stack is also used for subroutine calls via the JSR (jump to subroutine) and RTS (return from subroutine) instructions and for [[interrupt]] handling.\n\n===Addressing===\nThe chip uses the index and stack registers effectively with several [[addressing mode]]s, including a fast \"direct page\" or \"zero page\" mode, similar to that found on the [[PDP-8]], that accesses memory locations from addresses 0 to 255 with a single 8-bit address (saving the cycle normally required to fetch the high-order byte of the address){{mdash}}code for the 6502 uses the zero page much as code for other processors would use registers. On some 6502-based microcomputers with an operating system, the [[operating system]] uses most of zero page, leaving only a handful of locations for the user.\n\nAddressing modes also include ''implied'' (1-byte instructions); ''absolute'' (3 bytes); ''indexed absolute'' (3 bytes); ''indexed zero-page'' (2 bytes); ''relative'' (2 bytes); ''accumulator'' (1); ''indirect,x'' and ''indirect,y'' (2); and ''immediate'' (2). Absolute mode is a general-purpose mode. Branch instructions use a signed 8-bit offset relative to the instruction after the branch; the numerical range −128..127 therefore translates to 128 bytes backward and 127 bytes forward from the instruction following the branch (which is 126 bytes backward and 129 bytes forward from the start of the branch instruction). Accumulator mode uses the accumulator as an effective address and does not need any [[operand]] data. Immediate mode uses an 8-bit [[literal (computer programming)|literal]] operand.\n\n===Indirect addressing===\nThe indirect modes are useful for [[Array (data type)|array]] processing and other looping. With the 5/6 cycle \"(indirect),y\" mode, the 8-bit Y register is added to a 16-bit base address read from zero page, which is located by a single byte following the opcode. The Y register is therefore an ''index'' register in the sense that it is used to hold an actual ''index'' (as opposed to the X register in the 6800, where a base address was directly stored and to which an immediate offset could be added). Incrementing the index register to walk the array byte-wise takes only two additional cycles. With the less frequently used \"(indirect,x)\" mode the effective address for the operation is found at the zero page address formed by adding the second byte of the instruction to the contents of the X register. Using the indexed modes, the zero page effectively acts as a set of up to 128 additional (though very slow) address registers.\n\nThe 6502 is capable of performing addition and subtraction in binary or [[binary-coded decimal]]. Placing the CPU into BCD mode with the <code>SED</code> (set D flag) instruction results in decimal arithmetic, in which <code>$99 + $01</code> would result in <var>$00</var> and the carry (C) flag being set. In binary mode (<code>CLD</code>, clear D flag), the same operation would result in <var>$9A</var> and the carry flag being cleared. Other than [[Atari BASIC]], BCD mode was seldom used in home-computer applications.\n\nSee the [[wikibooks:Computer Programming/Hello world#Accumulator + index register machine: MOS Technology 6502, CBM KERNEL, MOS assembler syntax|Hello world!]] article for a simple but characteristic example of 6502 [[assembly language]].\n\n===Instructions and opcodes===\n6502 instruction [[opcode|operation code]]s (''opcodes'') are 8&nbsp;bits long and have the general form AAABBBCC, where AAA and CC define the opcode, and BBB defines the addressing mode.<ref name=ii>{{cite web |url=http://nparker.llx.com/a2/opcodes.html |title=The 6502/65C02/65C816 Instruction Set Decoded |first=Neil |last=Parker |website=Neil Parker's Apple II page |access-date=2019-07-16 |archive-date=2019-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716023057/http://nparker.llx.com/a2/opcodes.html |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFor instance, consider the <code>ORA</code> instruction, which performs a bitwise OR on the bits in the accumulator with another value. The instruction opcode is of the form 000bbb01, where bbb may be 010 for an immediate mode value (constant), 001 for zero-page fixed address, 011 for an absolute address, and so on.<ref name=ii/>\n\nThis pattern is not absolute, and there are a number of exceptions. However, where it does apply, it allows one to easily deconstruct opcode values back to assembly mnemonics for the majority of instructions, handling the edge cases with special-purpose code.<ref name=ii/>\n\nOf the 256 possible opcodes available using an 8-bit pattern, the original 6502 uses 151 of them, organized into 56 instructions with (possibly) multiple [[addressing mode]]s. Depending on the instruction and addressing mode, the opcode may require zero, one or two additional bytes for operands. Hence 6502 machine instructions vary in length from one to three bytes.<ref>[http://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html 6502 Instruction Set] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508053805/http://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html |date=2018-05-08}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.6502.org/tutorials/6502opcodes.html NMOS 6502 Opcodes]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114001557/http://www.6502.org/tutorials/6502opcodes.html |date=2016-01-14}}.</ref> The operand is stored in the 6502's customary [[endianness#Atomic element size 8-bit 2|little-endian format]].\n\nThe [[WDC 65C816|65C816]], the 16-bit [[CMOS]] descendant of the 6502, also supports 24-bit addressing, which results in instructions being assembled with three-byte operands, also arranged in little-endian format.\n\nThe remaining 105 opcodes are undefined. In the original design, instructions where the low-order 4&nbsp;bits (''nibble'') were 3, 7, B or F were not used, providing room for future expansion. Likewise, the $2x column had only a single entry, <code>LDX #''constant''</code>. The remaining 25 empty slots were distributed. Some of the empty slots were used in the 65C02 to provide both new instructions and variations on existing ones with new addressing modes. The $Fx instructions were initially left free to allow 3rd-party vendors to add their own instructions, but later versions of the 65C02 standardized a set of [[bit manipulation]] instructions developed by [[Rockwell Semiconductor]].\n\n===Assembly language===\nA 6502 [[assembly language]] statement consists of a three-character instruction [[mnemonic]], followed by any [[operand]]s. Instructions that do not take a separate operand but target a single register based on the addressing mode combine the target register in the instruction mnemonic, so the assembler uses <code>INX</code> as opposed to <code>INC X</code> to increment the X register.\n\n===Instruction table===\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n!colspan=13| Opcode matrix for the 6502 instruction set \n|-\n|colspan=13| Addressing modes: {{font color||#e0e0e0|'''''A'''''}} – accumulator, {{font color||#e0ffe0|'''''#'''''}} – immediate, {{font color||#ffe0e0|'''''zpg'''''}} – zero page, {{font color||#e0ffff|'''''abs'''''}} – absolute, {{font color||#ffe0ff|'''''ind'''''}} – indirect, '''''X''''' – indexed by X register, '''''Y''''' – indexed by Y register, {{font color||#ffffe0|'''''rel'''''}} – relative\n|-\n!rowspan=2| High nibble ||colspan=12| Low nibble\n|- \n! 0||  1||  2||  4||  5||  6||  8||  9||  A||  C||  D||  E\n|- \n! 0\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|BRK\n| bgcolor=#ffe0ff|ORA (''ind'',X)\n| \n| \n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|ORA ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|ASL ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|PHP\n| bgcolor=#e0ffe0|ORA #\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|ASL A\n| \n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ORA ''abs''\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ASL ''abs''\n|- \n! 1\n| bgcolor=#ffffe0|BPL ''rel''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0ff|ORA (''ind''),Y\n| \n| \n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|ORA ''zpg'',X\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|ASL ''zpg'',X\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|CLC\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ORA ''abs'',Y\n| \n| \n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ORA ''abs'',X\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ASL ''abs'',X\n|- \n! 2\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|JSR ''abs''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0ff|AND (''ind'',X)\n| \n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|BIT ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|AND ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|ROL ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|PLP\n| bgcolor=#e0ffe0|AND #\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|ROL A\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|BIT ''abs''\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|AND ''abs''\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ROL ''abs''\n|- \n! 3\n| bgcolor=#ffffe0|BMI ''rel''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0ff|AND (''ind''),Y\n| \n| \n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|AND ''zpg'',X\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|ROL ''zpg'',X\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|SEC\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|AND ''abs'',Y\n| \n| \n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|AND ''abs'',X\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ROL ''abs'',X\n|- \n! 4\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|RTI\n| bgcolor=#ffe0ff|EOR (''ind'',X)\n| \n| \n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|EOR ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|LSR ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|PHA\n| bgcolor=#e0ffe0|EOR #\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|LSR A\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|JMP ''abs''\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|EOR ''abs''\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|LSR ''abs''\n|- \n! 5\n| bgcolor=#ffffe0|BVC ''rel''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0ff|EOR (''ind''),Y\n| \n| \n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|EOR ''zpg'',X\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|LSR ''zpg'',X\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|CLI\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|EOR ''abs'',Y\n| \n| \n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|EOR ''abs'',X\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|LSR ''abs'',X\n|- \n! 6\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|RTS\n| bgcolor=#ffe0ff|ADC (''ind'',X)\n| \n| \n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|ADC ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|ROR ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|PLA\n| bgcolor=#e0ffe0|ADC #\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|ROR A\n| bgcolor=#ffe0ff|JMP (''ind'')\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ADC ''abs''\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ROR ''abs''\n|- \n! 7\n| bgcolor=#ffffe0|BVS ''rel''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0ff|ADC (''ind''),Y\n| \n| \n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|ADC ''zpg'',X\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|ROR ''zpg'',X\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|SEI\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ADC ''abs'',Y\n| \n| \n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ADC ''abs'',X\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|ROR ''abs'',X\n|- \n! 8\n| \n| bgcolor=#ffe0ff|STA (''ind'',X)\n| \n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|STY ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|STA ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|STX ''zpg''\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|DEY\n| \n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|TXA\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|STY ''abs''\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|STA ''abs''\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|STX ''abs''\n|- \n! 9\n| bgcolor=#ffffe0|BCC ''rel''\n| bgcolor=#ffe0ff|STA (''ind''),Y\n| \n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|STY ''zpg'',X\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|STA ''zpg'',X\n| bgcolor=#ffe0e0|STX ''zpg'',Y\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|TYA\n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|STA ''abs'',Y\n| bgcolor=#e0e0e0|TXS\n| \n| bgcolor=#e0ffff|STA ''abs'',X\n| \n|- \n!

The implication of this feature is that a [[wired-OR]] interrupt circuit is not readily supported. However, this also prevents nested NMI interrupts from occurring until the hardware makes the NMI input inactive again, often under control of the NMI [[interrupt handler]].\n\nThe simultaneous assertion of the NMI and [[Interrupt request|IRQ]] (maskable) hardware interrupt lines causes IRQ to be ignored. However, if the IRQ line remains [[assertion (software development)|asserted]] after the servicing of the NMI, the processor will immediately respond to IRQ, as IRQ is [[Interrupt#Level-triggered|level sensitive]]. Thus a sort of built-in interrupt priority was established in the 6502 design.\n\n{{anchor|BRK Flag}}The B flag is set by the 6502's periodically sampling its NMI edge detector's output and its IRQ input. The IRQ signal being driven low is only recognized though if IRQs are allowed by the I flag. If in this way a NMI request or (maskable) IRQ is detected the B flag is set to zero and causes the processor to execute the BRK instruction next instead of executing the next instruction based on the program counter.<ref>{{Cite web|title=INTERRUPT HANDLING|url=https://github.com/ogamespec/breaks/blob/master/Docs/6502/6502_circuitlab/interrupt-handling.png|access-date=2021-05-15|website=ogamespec|quote=FLAG B CONTROL; FLAG B}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=6502 BRK and B bit|url=http://visual6502.org/wiki/index.php?title=6502_BRK_and_B_bit|url-status=dead|access-date=2021-05-15|website=VisualChips|archive-date=2021-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210405071302/http://visual6502.org/wiki/index.php?title=6502_BRK_and_B_bit}}</ref>\n\nThe BRK instruction then pushes the processor status onto the stack, with the B flag bit set to zero. At the end of its execution the BRK instruction resets the B flag's value to one. This is the only way the B flag can be modified. If an instruction other than the BRK instruction pushes the B flag onto the stack as part of the processor status<ref>{{Cite web|title=FLAGS|url=https://github.com/ogamespec/breaks/blob/master/Docs/6502/6502_circuitlab/flags.png|access-date=2021-05-15|website=ogamespec|quote=B_OUT; INTERNAL DATA BUS (DB)}}</ref> the B flag always has the value one.\n\nA high-to-low transition on the SO input pin will set the processor's overflow status bit. This can be used for fast response to external hardware. For example, a high-speed [[Polling (computer science)|polling]] device driver can poll the hardware once in only three cycles using a Branch-on-oVerflow-Clear (<code>BVC</code>) instruction that branches to itself until overflow is set by an SO falling transition. The [[Commodore 1541]] and other [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[floppy disk]] drives use this technique to detect when the [[serialization|serializer]] is ready to transfer another byte of disk data. The system hardware and software design must ensure that an SO will not occur during arithmetic processing and disrupt calculations.\n\n==Variations and derivatives {{anchor|variants|Variants}}==\nThe 6502 was the most prolific variant of the 65xx series family from [[MOS Technology]].\n\nThe 6501 and 6502 have 40-pin [[dual inline package|DIP]] packages; the 6503, 6504, 6505, and 6507 are 28-pin DIP versions, for reduced chip and circuit board cost. In all of the 28-pin versions, the pin count is reduced by leaving off some of the high-order address pins and various combinations of function pins, making those functions unavailable.\n\nTypically, the 12 pins omitted to reduce the pin count from 40 to 28 are the three not connected (NC) pins, one of the two Vss pins, one of the clock pins, the SYNC pin, the set overflow (SO) pin, either the maskable interrupt or the non-maskable interrupt (NMI), and the four most-significant address lines (A12&ndash;A15).  The omission of four address pins reduces the external addressability to 4&nbsp;KB (from the 64&nbsp;KB of the 6502), though the internal PC register and all effective address calculations remain [[16-bit computing|16-bit]].\n\nThe [[MOS Technology 6507|6507]] omits both interrupt pins in order to include address line A12, providing 8 KB of external addressability but no interrupt capability.  The 6507 was used in the popular [[Atari 2600]] video game console, the design of which divides the 8 KB memory space in half, allocating the lower half to the console's internal RAM and peripherals, and the upper half to the Game Cartridge, so Atari 2600 cartridges have a 4 KB address limit (and the same capacity limit unless the cartridge contains [[bank switching]] circuitry).\n\nOne popular 6502-based computer, the [[Commodore 64]], used a modified 6502 CPU, the [[MOS Technology 6510|6510]]. Unlike the 6503&ndash;6505 and 6507, the 6510 is a 40-pin chip that adds internal hardware: a 6-bit parallel I/O port mapped to addresses 0000 and 0001. The [[MOS Technology 6508|6508]] is another chip that, like the 6510, adds internal hardware: 256 bytes of [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] and an 8-bit I/O port similar to those featured by the 6510. Though these chips do not have reduced pin counts compared to the 6502, they need new pins for the added parallel I/O port.  In this case, no address lines are among the removed pins.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Variations\n|-\n! Company\n! Model\n!

The W65C816S is a newer variant of the 65C816, which is the core of the [[Apple IIGS]] computer and is the basis of the [[Ricoh 5A22]] processor that powers the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The W65C816S incorporates minor improvements over the 65C816 that make the newer chip not an exact hardware-compatible replacement for the earlier one. Among these improvements was conversion to a static core, which makes it possible to stop the clock in either phase without the registers losing data. Available through electronics distributors, as of March 2020, the W65C816S is officially rated for 14&nbsp;MHz operation.\n\nThe Western Design Center also designed and produced the [[WDC 65C816|65C802]], which was a 65C816 core with a 64-kilobyte address space in a 65(C)02 pin-compatible package. The 65C802 could be retrofitted to a 6502 board and would function as a 65C02 on power-up, operating in \"emulation mode.\" As with the 65C816, a two-instruction sequence would switch the 65C802 to \"native mode\" operation, exposing its 16-bit [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]] and [[index register]]s, and other 65C816 features. The 65C802 was not widely used and production ended.\n\n==Bugs and quirks==\nThe 6502 had several [[hardware bug|bugs]] and quirks, which had to be accounted for when programming it:\n\n* The earliest revisions of the 6502, such as those shipped with some [[KIM-1]] computers, did not have a [[circular shift|ROR]] (rotate right memory or accumulator) instruction. The operation of ROR in these chips is effectively an ASL (arithmetic shift left) instruction that does not affect the carry bit in the status register. MOS left the instruction out of chip documentation entirely, promising that ROR would appear on 6502 chips starting in 1976.<ref name=\"ROR\" />{{efn|Eric Schlaepfer, who built a transitorized replica of the 6502 at monster6502.com, argues in his Youtube video \"The 6502 Rotate Right Myth\" (by TubeTimeUS) that according to Chuck Peddle and Bill Mensch there was no ROR bug. Instead, the instruction was not implemented at all as it was deemed unnecessary. Schlaepfer then compares screenshots from the early revision to later revisions of the 6502 and proves that the ROR instruction was not present in either the instruction decoding, wiring, or execution parts of the chip.}} The vast majority of 6502 chips in existence today do not exhibit this quirk.\n* The [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] 6502 family has a variety of [[illegal opcode|undocumented instructions]], which vary from one chip manufacturer to another. The 6502 instruction decoding is implemented in a [[hardwired control|hardwired]] logic array (similar to a [[programmable logic array]]) that is only defined for 151 of the 256 available [[opcode]]s. The remaining 105 trigger strange and occasionally hard-to-predict actions, such as crashing the processor, performing two valid instructions consecutively, performing strange mixtures of two instructions, or simply doing nothing at all. Eastern House Software developed the \"Trap65\", a device that plugged between the processor and its socket to convert (trap) unimplemented opcodes into [[BRK]] (software interrupt) instructions.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Some programmers utilized this feature to extend the 6502 instruction set by providing functionality for the unimplemented opcodes with specially written software intercepted at the BRK instruction's 0xFFFE vector.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Moser |first=Carl W. |title=Add a Trap Vector for Unimplemented 6502 Opcodes |magazine=Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computer Calisthenics and Orthodontia |issue=31 |page=32 |url=http://archive.6502.org/publications/dr_dobbs_journal/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_04.pdf |date=January 1979 |location=Menlo Park, California |access-date=2017-01-07 |archive-date=2016-06-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611125516/http://archive.6502.org/publications/dr_dobbs_journal/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_04.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Harrod |first=Dennette A. |title=The 6502 Gets Microprogrammable Instructions |magazine=BYTE |volume=5 |issue=10 |page=282 |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1980-10 |date=October 1980 |location=Peterborough, New Hampshire |access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref> All of the undefined opcodes have been replaced with [[NOP (code)|NOP]] instructions in the [[65C02]], an enhanced [[CMOS]] version of the 6502, although with varying byte sizes and execution times. In the [[WDC 65C816|65C802/65C816]], all 256 opcodes perform defined operations.\n* The 6502's [[indirect branch|memory indirect jump]] instruction, <code>JMP (&lt;address>)</code>, is partly broken. If <var>&lt;address></var> is [[hexadecimal|hex]] <var>xxFF</var> (i.e., any word ending in <var>FF</var>), the processor will not jump to the address stored in <var>xxFF</var> and <code>xxFF+1</code> as expected, but rather the one defined by <var>xxFF</var> and <var>xx00</var> (for example, <code>JMP ($10FF)</code> would jump to the address stored in 10FF and 1000, instead of the one stored in 10FF and 1100). This defect continued through the entire NMOS line, but was corrected in the CMOS derivatives.\n* The NMOS 6502 indexed addressing across page boundaries will do an extra read of an invalid address. This characteristic may cause random issues by accessing hardware that acts on a read, such as clearing timer or IRQ flags, sending an I/O handshake, etc. This defect continued through the entire NMOS line, but was corrected in the CMOS derivatives, in which the processor does an extra read of the last instruction byte.\n* The 6502 [[read–modify–write]] instructions perform one read and two write cycles. First, the unmodified data that was read is written back, and then the modified data is written. This characteristic may cause issues by twice accessing hardware that acts on a write. This anomaly continued through the full NMOS line, but was fixed in the CMOS derivatives, in which the processor does two reads and one write cycle. [[Defensive programming]] practice will generally avoid this problem by not executing read/modify/write instructions on hardware registers.\n* The N (result negative), V (sign bit overflow) and Z (result zero) [[status register|status flags]] are generally meaningless when performing arithmetic operations while the processor is in [[binary-coded decimal|BCD]] mode, as these flags reflect the binary, not BCD, result. This limitation was removed in the CMOS derivatives. Therefore, this feature may be used to distinguish a CMOS processor from an NMOS version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.s-direktnet.de/homepages/k_nadj/cputest.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102014138/http://www.s-direktnet.de/homepages/k_nadj/cputest.html |title=65c02, 6502, 65816 ??? CPU sells but who's buying... |date=19 June 1997 |author=Draco |archive-date=2 January 2008}}</ref>\n* If the 6502 happens to be in BCD mode when a hardware interrupt occurs, it will not revert to binary mode. This characteristic could result in obscure bugs in the interrupt service routine if it fails to clear BCD mode before performing any arithmetic operations. For example, the [[Commodore 64]]'s [[KERNAL]] did not correctly handle this processor characteristic, requiring that [[interrupt request|IRQ]]s be disabled or re-vectored during BCD math operations. This issue was addressed in the CMOS derivatives also.\n* The 6502 instruction set includes BRK (opcode $00), which is technically a [[software interrupt]] (similar in spirit to the SWI mnemonic of the [[Motorola 6800]] and [[ARM architecture family|ARM]] processors). BRK is most often used to interrupt program execution and start a [[Machine code monitor|machine language monitor]] for testing and debugging during software development. BRK could also be used to route program execution using a simple jump table (analogous to the manner in which the [[Intel 8086]] and derivatives handle software interrupts by number). However, if a [[hardware interrupt]] occurs when the processor is fetching a BRK instruction, the NMOS version of the processor will fail to execute BRK and instead proceed as if only a hardware interrupt had occurred. This fault was corrected in the CMOS implementation of the processor.\n* When executing JSR (jump to subroutine) and RTS (return from subroutine) instructions, the return address pushed to the stack by JSR is that of the last byte of the JSR operand (that is, the most significant byte of the subroutine address), rather than the address of the following instruction.

It is a modified form of the very successful [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]]. The 6510 is widely used in the [[Commodore 64]] (C64) [[home computer]] and its variants.\n\nThe primary change from the 6502 is the addition of an 8-bit general purpose [[input/output|I/O]] port, although 6 I/O pins are available in the most common version of the 6510. In addition, the address bus can be made [[three-state logic|tristate]] and the CPU can be halted cleanly.\n\n==Use==\nIn the C64, the extra I/O pins of the processor are used to control the computer's [[memory map]] by [[bank switching]], and for controlling three of the four signal lines of the [[Commodore Datasette|Datasette]] tape recorder (the electric motor control, key-press sensing and write data lines; the read data line went to another I/O chip).  It is possible, by writing the correct [[bit pattern]] to the processor at address $01, to completely expose almost the full 64&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] in the C64, leaving no [[Read-only memory|ROM]] or [[I/O]] hardware exposed except for the processor I/O port itself and its data directional register at address $00.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue32/112_1_COMMODORE_64_ARCHITECTURE.php |title=Commodore 64 Architecture |first=Jim|last=Butterfield |magazine=Compute! |date=January 1983 |page=208 |issue=32}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n[[Image:6510 CPU Pinout.svg|thumb|300px|Pin configuration of the most common variation of the 6510 CPU (/HALT in this image refers to the RDY pin)]]\n\n=== MOS 8500 {{anchor|8500}} ===\nIn 1985, MOS produced the '''8500''', an [[HMOS]] version of the 6510. Other than the process modification, it is virtually identical to the [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] version of the 6510. The 8500 was originally designed for use in the modernised C64, the C64C. However, in 1985, limited quantities of 8500s were found on older NMOS-based C64s. It finally made its official debut in 1987, appearing in a motherboard using the new 85xx HMOS chipset.\n\n=== MOS 7501/8501 {{anchor|7501|8501}} ===\n[[File:MOS8501R1.jpg|thumb|MOS 8501 CPU]]\nThe '''7501/8501''' variant of the 6510 was introduced in 1984.<ref name=\"auto\">[http://plus4world.powweb.com/hardware/MOS_75018501 Hardware – MOS 7501/8501]</ref> Compared to the 6510, this variant extends the number of I/O port pins from 6 to 8, but omits the pins for non-maskable interrupt and clock output.<ref>[https://ist.uwaterloo.ca/~schepers/MJK/7501.html  CPU 7501 / 8501]</ref>   It is used in Commodore's [[Commodore 16|C16]], [[Commodore 16|C116]] and [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]] home computers, where its I/O port controls not only the [[Commodore Datasette|Datasette]] but also the [[Commodore 1541#Interface|CBM Bus]] interface.

LaVell had previously worked for [[Rockwell Collins|Collins Radio]] on their C8500 computer that was built with small scale [[Emitter-coupled logic|ECL]] ICs. In 1971, he led a group that examined the needs of their existing customers such as [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register]], [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC), and [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC). They would study the customer's products and try to identify functions that could be implemented in larger integrated circuits at a lower cost. The result of the survey was a family of 15 building blocks; each could be implemented in an integrated circuit.<ref name=\"Motorola 6800 Oral History 2008\"/> Some of these blocks were implemented in the initial M6800 release and more were added over the next few years. To evaluate the 6800 architecture while the chip was being designed, LaVell's team built an equivalent circuit using 451 small scale TTL ICs on five 10 by 10 inch (25 by 25&nbsp;cm) circuit boards. Later they reduced this to 114 ICs on one board by using ROMs and MSI (medium scale integration) logic devices.<ref>''Electronics'' April 18, 1974.

Typical n-channel MOS IC's required three power supplies: -5 volts, +5 volts and +12 volts. The M6800 family was to use only one, +5 volts. It was easy to eliminate the −5 volt supply by using an internal [[voltage inverter]], but the [[enhancement-mode]] logic also needed a supply of 10 to 12 volts. To address this, the design added an on-chip voltage doubler. Buchanan did the circuit design, analysis and layout for the 6800 microprocessor.

The buffers for address and data buses were standard Motorola products. Motorola could supply every IC, transistor, and diode necessary to build an MC6800-based computer.\n\n=== MOS ICs ===\n[[File:Silicon wafer.jpg|thumb|upright=.75 | A silicon wafer holding many integrated circuit chips]]\n\nThe first-generation metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) chips used p-channel field-effect transistors, known as p-channel [[MOSFET]]s (p-channel describes the configuration of the transistor). These ICs were used in calculators and in the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004. They were easy to produce but were slow and difficult to interface to the popular [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]] digital logic ICs. An n-channel MOS integrated circuit could operate two or three times faster and was compatible with TTL. They were much more difficult to produce because of an increased sensitivity to contamination that required an ultra clean production line and meticulous process control.<ref name = \"Verhofstadt 1976\">{{Cite journal | last = Verhofstadt | first = Peter | title = Evaluation of technology options for LSI processing elements | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 64 | issue = 6 | pages =842–851 | publisher = IEEE | date = June 1976 | doi = 10.1109/PROC.1976.10234 | s2cid = 28259688 }}</ref> Motorola did not have an n-channel MOS production capability and had to develop one for the 6800 family.\n\nMotorola's n-channel MOS test integrated circuits were complete in late 1971 and these indicated the clock rate would be limited to 1&nbsp;MHz. These used \"[[enhancement-mode]]\" MOS transistors. There was a newer fabrication technology that used \"[[depletion-mode]]\" MOS transistors as loads, which would allow smaller and faster circuits (this was also known as [[depletion-load nMOS]]). The \"depletion-mode\" processing required extra steps so Motorola decided to stay with \"enhancement-mode\" for the new single-supply-voltage design. The 1&nbsp;MHz clock rate meant the chip designers would have to come up with several architectural innovations to speed up the microprocessor throughput.<ref name =\"Bennett 3962682\"/> These resulting circuits were faster but required more area on the chip.<ref>Motorola 6800 Oral History (2008), p. 27</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, semiconductors were fabricated on 3 inch (75&nbsp;mm) diameter [[Wafer (electronics)|silicon wafers]]. Each wafer could produce 100 to 200 integrated circuit chips or dies. The technical literature would state the length and width of each chip in \"mils\" (0.001 inch). The current industry practice is to state the chip area. Processing wafers required multiple steps and flaws would appear at various locations on the wafer during each step. The larger the chip the more likely it would encounter a defect. The percentage of working chips, or yield, declined steeply for chips larger than 160 mils (4&nbsp;mm) on a side.\n\nThe target size for the 6800 was 180 mils (4.6&nbsp;mm) on each side but the final size was 212 mils (5.4&nbsp;mm) with an area of 29.0&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>.

One point was that Motorola did not have patents on the technology. This was technically true when the lawsuit was filed in late 1975 {{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}. On October 30, 1974, before the 6800 was released, Motorola filed numerous patents applications on the microprocessor family, and over twenty patents were subsequently granted. The first was to Tom Bennett on June 8, 1976, for the 6800 internal address bus.<ref name =\"Bennett 3962682\"/> The second was to Bill Mensch on July 6, 1976, for the 6820 chip layout.<ref name =\"Mensch 3968478\"/> Many of these patents named several of the departing engineers as co-inventors. These patents covered the 6800 bus and how the peripheral chips interfaced with the microprocessor.<ref>Motorola was awarded the following US Patents on the 6800 microprocessor family: 3962682, 3968478, 3975712, 3979730, 3979732, 3987418, 4003028, 4004281, 4004283, 4006457, 4010448, 4016546, 4020472, 4030079, 4032896, 4037204, 4040035, 4050096, 4069510, 4071887, 4086627, 4087855, 4090236, 4106091, 4145751, 4218740, 4263650</ref>\n\n=== Move to Austin ===\n[[File:Motorola MC6820L MC6821L.jpg|thumb|The M6800 family chips were redesigned to use depletion-mode technology. The MC6820 PIA became the MC6821.]]\n[[File:Motorola MC6800 microprocessor ad August 1976.jpg|thumb|Three typical applications for the MC6800, as shown in a Motorola advertisement from August 1976: a point-of-sale terminal, an electronic signal tester, and a security card entry system.]]\nGary Daniels was designing ICs for electronic wristwatches when Motorola shut down their Timepiece Electronics Unit. Tom Bennett offered him a job in the microprocessor group in November 1974. Bennett did not want to leave the Phoenix area so Gary Daniels managed the microprocessor development in Austin. (Daniels was the microprocessor design manager for the next ten years before he was promoted to a vice president.)\n\nThe first task was to redesign the 6800 MPU to improve the manufacturing yield and to operate at a faster clock. This design used depletion-mode technology and was known internally as the MC6800D. The transistor count went from 4000 to 5000 but the die area was reduced from 29.0&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> to 16.5&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> (allowing the price of the CPU to be lowered to $35). The maximum clock rate for selected parts doubled to 2&nbsp;MHz. The other chips in the M6800 family were also redesigned to use depletion-mode technology. The Peripheral Interface Adapter had a slight change in the electrical characteristics of the I/O pins so the MC6820 became the MC6821.<ref name = \"MC6821\">{{Cite book | title = Advanced Information: 1.5 and 2.0 MHz Components for the M6800 Microcomputer System. | pages = 4–6 | publisher = Motorola Semiconductor Products | location = Austin, Texas | date = April 1977 | id = ADI-429}} The MC6820 became the MC6821 because the electrical characteristic of PA0–7 and PB0–7 pins changed slightly. The typical Input High Current went from −250 μAdc to −400 μAdc and the Input Low Current went from 1.0 mAdc to 1.3 mAdc.</ref> These new IC were completed in July 1976.\n\nA new low-cost clock generator chip, the MC6875, was released in 1977. It replaced the $35 MC6870 hybrid IC. The MC6875 came in a 16-pin dip package and could use quartz crystal or a resistor capacitor network.<ref name=\"MC6875 Byte Dec 1977\">{{Cite journal | title = New Clock Chip for 6800 Systems | journal = Byte | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | page =210 | publisher = Byte Publications | location = Peterborough NH | date = December 1977}} Requiring only a 5&nbsp;V supply and a quartz crystal or an RC network, the MC6875 provides buffered 2 phase clock outputs… $3.75 in 1000 piece quantities from Motorola Linear Products</ref>\n\nAnother project was incorporating 128 bytes of RAM and the clock generator on a single 11,000-transistor chip. The MC6802 microprocessor was released in March 1977. The companion MC6846 chip had 2048 byte ROM, an 8-bit bidirectional port and a programmable timer. This was a two-chip microcomputer. The 6802 has an on-chip oscillator that uses an external 4&nbsp;MHz quartz crystal to produce the two-phase 1&nbsp;MHz clock. The internal 128 byte RAM could be disabled by grounding a pin and devices with defective RAM were sold as a MC6808.<ref name = \"MC6802 March 1977\">{{Cite journal | title = Texas Instruments and Motorola pare down microprocessors for low end market | journal = Electronic | volume = 50 | issue = 5 |pages=34, 36 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | date = March 3, 1977}} MC6802 microprocessor has oscillator and 128 byte RAM.

The MC6840 programmable counter had three 16-bit binary counters that could be used for frequency measurement, event counting, or interval measurement. The MC6844 Direct Memory Access Controller could transfer data from an I/O controller to RAM without loading down the MC6800 microprocessor. The MC6845 CRT Controller (CRTC) provided the control logic for a character based computer terminal. The 6845 had support for a [[light pen]], an alternative to a computer mouse.\n\nThe MC6845 was a very popular chip: it was even used in the original [[IBM Monochrome Display Adapter]] and the original [[IBM Color Graphics Adapter]] for the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] and successors, where the 6845 was used with an Intel 8088 CPU.<ref>The MDA (i.e. [[Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter|MDPA]]) and CGA were both introduced by IBM simultaneously with the IBM PC in April 1981, as options for the PC and later for the [[IBM Personal Computer XT|PC XT]] and the [[IBM Personal Computer AT|PC AT]].</ref>  During the time of cold war technology embargoes, a 6845 clone named CM607 was produced in Bulgaria. The later [[IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] (EGA) card contained a custom IBM chip (the EGA CRTC) that replaced the Motorola 6845, adding many enhancements, in a mostly-compatible way.  The [[IBM Video Graphics Array]] (VGA), which became ubiquitous (to the point that it is still emulated as the baseline functionality of most modern PC video adapter chips) incorporates a compatible near-superset of the EGA CRTC, still mostly-compatible with the MC6845 (but by this point without the light pen support, which the EGA CRTC retained).\n\nThe MC6801 was a single-chip microcomputer (that today would also be called a microcontroller) incorporating a 6802 CPU with 128&nbsp;bytes of RAM, a 2&nbsp;KB ROM, a 16-bit timer, 31 programmable parallel I/O lines, and a serial port. (The MC6803 was the same except without the ROM and with fewer different bus configurations.) It could also use the I/O lines as data and address buses to connect to standard M6800 peripherals. The 6801 would execute 6800 code, but it had ten additional instructions, and the execution time of key instructions was reduced. The two 8-bit accumulators could act as a single 16-bit accumulator for double precision addition, subtraction and multiplication.<ref name = \"MC6801\">{{Cite book | title = Product Preview MC6801| publisher = Motorola Semiconductor Products | location = Austin, Texas | date = August 1978 | id = NP-93}}.</ref><ref name=\"manual_6801\" >{{cite book |title=MC6801 8-bit Single-Chip Computer Reference Manual |date=1983 |publisher=Motorola |url=https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_motorola68ReferenceManualMay84_19173732}}</ref> It was initially designed for automotive use, with General Motors as the lead customer.

In that sense, the 6809 was upward compatible with the 6800. The 6809 had two 16-bit index registers, two 16-bit stack pointers, and many instructions to perform 16-bit operations, including the first 8-bit multiply instruction (generating a 16-bit product) in a microprocessor. Other key points of the 6809 design were full support for both [[position-independent code]] (object code that can run wherever it is loaded in memory) and [[reentrant code]] (object code that can be re-invoked when interrupted or by calling itself recursively<ref>without the restriction that invocations must complete in the opposite of their order of initiation</ref>), features previously seen only in much larger machines such as IBM 360 mainframes.<ref name = \"MC6809\">{{Cite book | title = Product Preview MC6809| publisher = Motorola Semiconductor Products | location = Austin, Texas | date = December 1978 | id = NP-98 R1}}.</ref>\n\n== Use in personal computers ==\n[[File:SWTPC6800 open.jpg|thumb|The [[SWTPC 6800]] computer system, introduced in November 1975, was based on the MEK6800 design evaluation kit chip set.]]\n[[File:Altair 680.jpg|thumb|MITS Altair 680]]\nThe [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] Altair 8800, the first successful personal computer, used the Intel 8080 microprocessor and was featured on the January 1975 cover of ''[[Popular Electronics]]''.<ref name = \"PE Jan 1975\">{{cite magazine | author = H.

This ensured they could get parts if a supplier had financial problems or a disaster. Initially Motorola selected [[American Microsystems, Inc.|American Microsystems Inc (AMI)]] as a second source for the M6800 family. [[Hitachi]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Fairchild Semiconductor|Fairchild]], [[Rockwell Semiconductor|Rockwell]] and [[STMicroelectronics|Thomson Semiconductors]] were added later. <!--Hitachi second source for 6800, Dec 11 1975 page 39 Electronics--><!-- Rockwell second source InfoWorld Oct 17, 1979-->\n\n[[Rochester Electronics]] was authorized by Freescale/Motorola in 2014 to continue manufacturing any of the 8-bit peripherals and 8-bit processors of this era. Rochester specializes in fully authorized device duplication. Freescale has provided all the source design archives to enable [[Rochester Electronics]] for this product and others. At the end of 2016, Rochester was fully qualified and shipping the MC6802 processor, the MC6840 PTM, and the MC6809 processor (including the MC68A09, and MC68B09 versions) and can still be bought today.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:KL AMI S6800 Black Background.jpg | AMI S6800 MPU\nFile:Atari 90 6001 1.jpg|Atari 90-6001\nFile:Fairchild 6802 AMI 6820.jpg | Fairchild F6802P and an AMI S6820 PIA\nFile:Hitach HD46800 1.jpg | Hitachi HD46800\n</gallery>\n\n==Oral histories==\n*[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102658123 \"Intel 8080 Microprocessor Oral History Panel\"] Steve Bisset, Federico Faggin, Hal Feeney, Edward Gelbach, Ted Hoff, Stan Mazor, Masatoshi Shima, Computer History Museum, April 26, 2007, moderator: David House.\n*[http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102658073 \"Zilog Z80 Microprocessor Oral History Panel\"] Federico Faggin, Masatoshi Shima, Ralph Ungermann.

A lower-cost version was also made available, known as the '''68EC020'''. In keeping with naming practices common to Motorola designs, the 68020 is usually referred to as the \"020\", pronounced \"oh-two-oh\" or \"oh-twenty\".\n\nThe 020 was in the market for a relatively short time. The [[Motorola 68030]] was announced in September 1986 and began deliveries in the summer of 1987. Priced about the same as the 020 of the time, the 030 was significantly faster and quickly replaced in 020 in almost every use.\n\n==History==\n===68000 and 68010===\nAt the time the [[Motorola 68000]] was designed, Motorola's design and fabrication services were outdated. Although even small companies like [[MOS Technologies]] and [[Zilog]] had moved on to silicon gate [[depletion mode]] [[NMOS logic]] on ever-larger [[semiconductor wafer|wafers]], Motorola was still using metal gates and enhancement mode and their largest fab worked on 4-inch wafers long after most lines had moved to 5-inch. Although the 68000 met the goal of being the fastest CPU available when it was introduced, it was not nearly as powerful as it could be if it had been designed with more modern techniques.{{sfn|Oral|2007|pp=9-11}}\n\nDuring the period of the 68000 design, the company was working with [[Hitachi]] on their process technology and as part of this they opened a new fab, MOS-8, using 5-inch wafers and the latest [[HMOS]] process licensed from [[Intel]]. This line was capable of building all of the new techniques, but the 68000 went ahead with the older design as they were sure it would work. Moving to new design techniques would wait until the design was in the market.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=10}} The conversion to the new design techniques took place during the [[Motorola 68010]] effort, a relatively minor upgrade to the original design that added basic [[virtual memory]] support for the emerging [[Unix workstation]] market.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=20}}\n\n===020 concept emerges===\nAs this effort was ongoing, Motorola was canvassing their customers for their desires for future developments in the line. These all pointed to a fully 32-bit implementation. Those using the 68k in Unix systems also stated they would purchase a [[floating point unit]] for every one of the machines if one was available.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=22}}\n\nThe original 68000 had been designed as a hybrid 16/32-bit system largely because the maximum number of pins available on [[dual inline package]]s (DIPs) was 64, and even at that size, packaging of this size was highly problematic.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=9}} By reducing the number of [[address bus|address pins]] to 24, and the [[data bus|data pins]] to only 16, there were enough free pins to implement all the other needed lines, like interrupts and power supplies. The 24-pin address bus meant that the memory could only be 16&nbsp;MB in total, which was at this point becoming a limitation. The 16-bit data bus meant reading a 32-bit word from that memory required two clock cycles.\n\nA design that had 32 pins for both the address and data busses would access data twice as fast, making the machine that much faster even with no other changes. Moving to 32&nbsp;bit addressing would also make the implementation of virtual memory easier, and allow for more than 16&nbsp;MB of [[random access memory]]. But doing so would also demand a much higher total pin count. By the early 1980s, similar limitations on all modern CPU designs led to the introduction of the [[pin grid array]] that replaced the DIP. For the new project, Motorola selected a 169-pin layout, giving them plenty of room to work with. The design ultimately used only 114 of them.\n\nA great debate broke out about how to refer to the underlying design of the new chip in marketing materials. Technically, the 020 was moving from the long-established [[NMOS logic]] design to a [[CMOS]] layout, which requires two transistors per gate. Common knowledge of the era suggested that CMOS cost four times as much as NMOS, and there was a significant amount of the market that believed \"CMOS equals bad.\"{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=29}}\n\n===Launch, fabrication problems===\nThe design was completed in the summer of 1983 and announced in June 1984.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Motorla 68020 |magazine= Electronic Design |date=18 September 1986 |page=27}}</ref> This \"super chip\" was significant news at the time, with the [[New York Times]] making it a lead story in their business section. The launch price was quoted at $487 each, about the same as the 68000 when it was launched in 1980, but the 68000 was now available for about $15. However, it was understood that it would be some time before computers using the new chip would be available, as existing designs would have to be heavily modified to take advantage of its performance.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |date=29 June 1984 |title=Motorola's Powerful New Chip |first=David |last=Sanger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/29/business/motorola-s-powerful-new-chip.html}}</ref>\n\nThe announcement led to Motorola's customers clamouring for supply. At this point, serious supply problems became evident. The design had been laid out to be built in the same MOS-8 factory as the 68000, although several new pieces of equipment were introduced to support it. By the time of the public release, the yield for the new chip was zero. That is, for every wafer sent through the multi-step process, zero working chips would be produced.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=30}}\n\nGary Johnson concluded the problem was the floor manager of MOS-8, Tom Felesi, and decided to replace him with Bill Walker, who was at that time running the older MOS-2 factory. Walker arrived at the plant on 5 July 1985 to find Johnson had not bothered to tell Felesi of the change, and arguments followed. Johnson eventually told Felesi this was indeed happening. Walker then toured the plant and found it had been turned into what was essentially a [[research and development]] lab, not a production line, with numerous bits of machinery in use nowhere else.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=30}}\n\nOne significant issue was a new piece of equipment from a new vendor, Genius, which produced [[silicide]]. The machine simply didn't work. Walker flew to California to meet with the CEO of Genius, who offered up nothing but excuses. Walker eventually slammed his hand down on the desk, breaking his watch band, and stated \"No more excuses! I want this thing fixed now, today!\" Genius took the demand seriously and fixed the machine. The CEO later sent Walker a new watch band to commemorate the event.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=30}}\n\nMeanwhile, Walker instituted a new policy at MOS-8 to improve the plant itself. He normally called meetings at 6:30 AM. If things were not going well, he would move that up to 5:30, and even 4:30. This provided a strong incentive to get the plant running. The production problems were soon ironed out, and volume deliveries began late that year. By this point, their workstation customers had already developed complete systems ready to use the 020 and the new floating point unit, the [[Motorola 68881]]. Systems were in the market only five or six months after the 020 had been announced.{{sfn|Oral|2007|p=32}}\n\n===Replacement===\nDesign of the 020's follow-on began almost immediately. As part of their ongoing work with Hitachi, Motorola's fabrication system was finally catching up to the competition, as was their internal design workflow. This gave them considerably more room to work with, allowing the addition of larger [[processor cache]]s, a built-in [[memory management unit]] (MMU) and other features. The [[Motorola 68030]] was announced in September 1986,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Motorla 68030 |magazine= Electronic Design |date=18 September 1986 |page=27}}</ref> with deliveries to begin the next summer. Due to the changes in the production lines, the new 030 would have a lower launch price than the 020.\n\nThere were significant differences between the 68000 and 020, especially due to the 32-bit memory interface. This required computer designs using it to be considerably different from earlier models. In contrast, there were few changes between the 020 and 030, the latter of which could be used as a drop-in replacement in many roles. For this reason, designs using the 030 appeared much more quickly after its release than the 020. The first [[Macintosh]] with the 020 was the [[Macintosh II]], released in March 1987, two years after the 020 had become widely available.<ref>{{cite magazine\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LWkn070OgWQC&q=appleworld+1987&pg=PA1\n| title = Apple Debuts Two \"Open\" MacIntoshes, Is Developing a Mac Ethernet Interface With 3Com\n| magazine = Local Area Networks Newsletter\n| date = April 1987\n| page = 1\n| volume = 5\n| issue = 4\n}}</ref> with low-volume initial shipments starting two months later.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://tech-insider.org/mac/research/1987/0507.html\n| title = Apple Begins Shipments Of Macintosh II Computer\n| date =8 May 1987\n| newspaper = Wall Street Journal\n}}</ref> Only eighteen months later, the [[Macintosh IIx]] replaced it, using the 030.

The 68020's [[arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] is also natively 32-bit, so can perform 32-bit operations in one clock cycle, whereas the 68000 took a minimum of two clock cycles due to its 16-bit ALU. Newer packaging methods allowed the '020 to feature more external pins without the large size that the earlier [[dual in-line package]] method required. The 68EC020 lowered cost through a 24-bit address bus. The 68020 was produced at speeds ranging from 12&nbsp;MHz to 33&nbsp;MHz.\n\n[[Image:Motorola 68020 die.JPG|thumb|250px|Motorola 68020 die shot]]\n[[Image:XC68020 bottom p1160085.jpg|thumb|250px|bottom view of a Motorola XC68020]]\n\n=== Improvements over the 68010 ===\nThe 68020 has a 32-bit [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), 32-bit external data and address buses.  It adds extra instructions and additional addressing modes. The 68020 (and 68030) has a proper three-stage pipeline. Though the 68010 had a \"loop mode\", which sped loops through what was effectively a tiny instruction cache, it held only two short instructions and was thus little used. The 68020 replaced this with a proper instruction cache of 256 bytes, the first 68k series processor to feature true on-chip cache memory.\n \nThe previous 68000 and 68010 processors could only access word (16-bit) and long word (32-bit) data in memory if it were word-aligned (located at an even address). The 68020 has no alignment restrictions on data access. Naturally, unaligned accesses are slower than aligned accesses because they required an extra memory access.\n\nThe 68020 has a small 256-byte direct-mapped instruction cache, arranged as 64 four-byte entries. Although small, it still made a significant difference in the performance of many applications. The resulting decrease in bus traffic was particularly important in systems relying heavily on [[Direct memory access|DMA]].\n\n=== Coprocessor support ===\nThe 68020 has a [[coprocessor]] interface supporting up to eight coprocessors. The main [[central processing unit|CPU]] recognizes \"F-line\" instructions (with the four most significant opcode bits all one), and uses special bus cycles to interact with a coprocessor to execute these instructions. Two types of coprocessors were defined: floating point units ([[Motorola 68881|MC68881 or MC68882]] [[floating-point unit|FPUs]]) and the paged memory management unit ([[Motorola 68851|MC68851]] PMMU). Only one PMMU can be used with a CPU. In principle, multiple FPUs could be used with a CPU, but it was not commonly done. The coprocessor interface is asynchronous, so it is possible to run the coprocessors at a different clock rate than the CPU.\n\n=== Multiprocessing features ===\nMultiprocessing support is implemented externally by the use of an RMC pin<ref>{{cite web| url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a245775.pdf| title=Video-Text Processing By Using Motorola 68020 CPU And Its Environment |at=MC68020 Signal Description, Appendix A, p. 84| first=M.

To avoid problems with returns from coprocessor, bus error, and address error exceptions, it was generally necessary in a multiprocessor system for all CPUs to be the same model, and for all FPUs to be the same model as well.\n\n=== Instruction set ===\nThe new instructions include some minor improvements and extensions to the supervisor state, several instructions for software management of a multiprocessing system (which were removed in the 68060), some support for high-level languages which did not get used much (and was removed from future 680x0 processors), bigger multiply (32×32→64 bits) and divide (64÷32→32 bits quotient and 32 bits remainder) instructions, and bit field manipulations.\n\nThe new addressing modes add [[Addressing mode#Scaled|scaled indexing]] and another level of [[Addressing mode#Memory indirect|indirection]] to many of the pre-existing modes.\n\n== Architecture ==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%;width:39em;\"\n|-\n|+ Motorola 68020 registers\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:10px;

Some programs used the high 8 bits (bits 24-31) of addresses to contain various flag bits, with the understanding that the earlier 680x0 CPUs would safely ignore these high bits. Such software had to be rewritten to adjust to the larger physical address space available to the 68020 and later CPUs.\n\n== Usage ==\nThe 68020 was used in the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh II]] and [[Macintosh LC]] [[personal computer]]s, [[Sun-3]] workstations, [[Amiga 1200]] (68EC020 variant), the [[Hewlett-Packard]] 8711 Series Network Analyzers, [[HP 9000]]/320, HP 9000/330, [[Apollo Computer]]'s [[Apollo/Domain|DN3000 and DN4000]] workstations,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web-docs.gsi.de/~kraemer/COLLECTION/www.hunkler.com/aegis/aegis_sg.html|title=Survival Guide for Apollo Workstations|author=Tim Hunkler|date=July 1996|access-date=2022-10-13}}</ref> and the [[Alpha Microsystems]] AM-2000. The 68020 was an alternative upgrade to the [[Sinclair QL]]'s [[Motorola 68008|68008]] in the Super Gold Card interface by [[Miracle Systems]].\n\nThe [[Amiga 2500]] and A2500UX optionally shipped with the A2620 Accelerator using a 68020, 68881 FPU and 68851 MMU. The 2500UX shipped with [[Amiga Unix]], requiring an '020 or '030 processor.\n\nA number of [[Digital storage oscilloscope|digital oscilloscopes]] from the mid-80s to the late-90s used the 68020, including the [[LeCroy Corporation|LeCroy]] 9300 Series<ref>LeCroy 1996 Test & Measurement Product Catalog, 9300 Series Upgrade Path, p. 66</ref> (higher end models including \"C\" suffix models used the more powerful [[68EC030]];<ref>LeCroy 1998 Test & Measurement Product Catalog, 9300 Series Hardware Options, Mega Waveform Processing, pp. 87–88</ref> the 9300 models with a 68020 processor can be upgraded to the [[68EC030]] with a change of the CPU board<ref>LeCroy 1996 Test & Measurement Product Catalog, 9300 Series Hardware Options, Mega Waveform Processing, pp. 66-67</ref>) and the earlier LeCroy 9400 series (all models<ref>LeCroy 9410 Digital Oscilloscope Service Manual, 9410 Hardware Overview, Section 2.1, December 1991</ref><ref>LeCroy 9424 Digital Oscilloscope Service Manual, 9424 Hardware Overview, Section 2.1, May 1993</ref><ref>LeCroy 9450 Digital Oscilloscope Service Manual, 9450 Hardware Overview, October 1990</ref><ref>LeCroy 9450A Digital Oscilloscope Service Manual, 9450 Hardware Overview, December 1991</ref> excluding the 9400/9400A which used the [[68000]]<ref>LeCroy 9400/9400A Digital Oscilloscope Service Manual, Section 1.1.1.3 Microprocessor, August 1990</ref>), along with certain [[Tektronix]] TDS Series models.<ref>Tektronix TDS684A, TDS744A, & TDS784A Digitizing Oscilloscope Service Manual, 070-8992-03, January 1995</ref> The HP 54520, 54522, 54540 and 54542 also use the 68020, together with a 68882 FPU.<ref>Hewlett Packard 54520 and 54540 Series Oscilloscope Service Guide (54542-97015), Chapter 8, Main Assembly Theory, April 1994</ref>\n\nIt is also the processor used on [[TGV]] trains to decode signalling information sent to the trains through the rails. It is used in the flight control and radar systems of the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] combat aircraft.\n\nThe Nortel Networks [[DMS-100]] telephone central office switch also used the 68020 as the first [[microprocessor]] of the SuperNode computing core.\n\n== Variant ==\n[[Image:KL Motorola MC68EC020.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Motorola MC68EC020]]\n[[File:M68EC020.jpg|thumb|MC68EC020 in 20mm × 14mm QFP package]]\nThe '''68EC020''' is a lower cost version of the Motorola 68020. The main difference is that the 68EC020 only has a 24-bit address bus, rather than the 32-bit address bus of the full 68020, and thus is only able to address 16&nbsp;MB of memory.\n\nThe [[Amiga 1200]] computer and the [[Amiga CD32]] game console use the cost-reduced 68EC020; the [[Namco System 22]], [[Taito F3 System|Taito F3]] and [[Konami GX]] arcade boards also used this processor. The [[Atari Corporation|Atari]] Jaguar II prototype featured this to replace the 68000 of the original [[Atari Jaguar]] console. \n\nIt also found use in laser printers. Apple used it in the LaserWriter IIɴᴛx. Kodak used it in the Ektaplus 7016PS, and Dataproducts used it in the LZR 1260.\n\nIn 2014, [[Rochester Electronics]] re-established manufacturing capability for the 68020 microprocessor and it is still available today.\n\n== Technical data ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Formal name\n|  MC68020<ref name=\"fund020\"/>{{rp|577}}\n|-\n| CPU [[clock rate]]\n|  {{nowrap|12.5, 16.67, 20, 25, 33 MHz}} (minimum 8&nbsp;MHz, no on-chip clock generation)<ref name=\"fund020\"/>{{rp|577}}\n|-\n| Voltage supply\n|  {{nowrap|5 V}}<!--no reference found-->\n|-\n| Maximum power\n|  {{nowrap|1.75 W}}<ref name=\"fund020\"/>{{rp|577}}\n|-\n| Production process\n|   HCMOS, 3/8\" silicon piece<ref name=\"fund020\"/>{{rp|577}}\n|-\n| [[Chip carrier]]\n|   [[Pin grid array|PGA 169]] (114 pins used) {{nowrap|34.16 mm × 34.16 mm}}<ref name=\"fund020\"/>{{rp|577}} (53&nbsp;°C/W without heatsink)<!--282/313--><ref name=\"free020UM\" />\n|-\n| Address bus\n|   32-bit (4&nbsp;GB directly linear addressable)<ref name=\"fund020\"/>{{rp|578}}<br/>[68EC020] 24-bit (16&nbsp;MB addressable)\n|-\n| Data bus\n|   32-bit<!--no reference found, assumed..-->\n|-\n| [[Instruction set]]\n|   101 [[Complex instruction set computing|CISC]] instructions\n|-\n| Cache\n|   {{nowrap|256 byte}} instruction cache<ref name=\"fund020\"/>{{rp|578}}<ref name=\"free020UM\" /><!--\"128 16-bit word cache\"-->\n|-\n| Register ||<!--3x 32-bit ALU-->\n* 7 for Address operations (32-bit)<ref name=\"fund020\"/>{{rp|578}}\n* 8 for Data operations (32-bit)<ref name=\"fund020\"/>{{rp|578}}\n|-\n| Branch handling \n| Branch prediction:\n* Fixed branch prediction, branch-never-taken approach<ref>{{cite book | title = Guide to RISC Processors | url = https://archive.org/details/guidetoriscproce00dand_422 | url-access = limited | year = 2004 | author = Dandamudi, S.

It was released in 1987. The 68030 was the successor to the [[Motorola 68020]], and was followed by the [[Motorola 68040]]. In keeping with general [[Motorola]] naming, this CPU is often referred to as the 030 (pronounced ''oh-three-oh'' or ''oh-thirty'').\n\nThe 68030 is essentially a 68020 with a [[memory management unit]] (MMU) and instruction and data caches of 256 [[byte]]s each. It added a [[burst mode (computing)|burst mode]] for the caches, where four [[longword]]s can be loaded into the cache in a single operation. The MMU was mostly compatible with the external [[Motorola 68851|68851]] that would be used with the 68020,<ref>{{cite web |first=Roy |last=Gord |date=2 May 1990 |title=68851 PMMU and 68030 MMU |url=http://www.verycomputer.com/154_18105061e58769a5_1.htm |access-date=2017-05-24 |quote=Neither the PMMU nor the 68030 MMU constitutes a proper superset of the other. The PMMU has instructions and registers not found in the 68030 MMU, while the latter has registers not on the PMMU. However, in a typical Unix implementation little work would needed [sic] to port PMMU specific code to the 68030.}}</ref> but being internal allowed it to access memory one cycle faster than a 68020/68851 combo. The 68030 did not include a built-in [[floating-point unit]] (FPU), and was generally used with the [[Motorola 68881|68881]] and the faster [[Motorola 68882|68882]]. The addition of the FPU was a major design note of the subsequent 68040. The 68030 lacks some of the 68020's instructions, but it increases performance by ≈5% while reducing power draw by ≈25%.\n\nThe 68030 features 273,000 transistors. A lower-cost version was also released, the Motorola 68EC030, lacking the on-chip MMU. It was commonly available in both 132-pin [[Quad Flat Package|QFP]] and 128-pin [[Pin Grid Array|PGA]] packages. The poorer thermal characteristics of the QFP package limited that variant to 33&nbsp;MHz; the PGA 68030s included 40&nbsp;MHz and 50&nbsp;MHz versions. There was also a small supply of QFP packaged EC variants.\n\n[[File:Motorola MC68030RC33B.JPG|thumb|Motorola MC68030RC33B die]]\n\nThe 68030 can be used with the 68020 bus, in which case its performance is similar to 68020 that it was derived from. However, the 68030 provides an additional synchronous bus interface which, if used, accelerates memory accesses up to 33% compared to an equally clocked 68020. The finer manufacturing process allowed Motorola to scale the full-version processor to 50&nbsp;MHz. The EC variety topped out at 40&nbsp;MHz.\n\n==Usage==\nThe 68030 was used in many models of the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh II]] and [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] series of [[personal computer]]s, [[NeXT]] [[NeXT Computer|Cube]], later [[Alpha Microsystems]] multiuser systems, and some descendants of the [[Atari ST]] line such as the [[Atari TT030|Atari TT]] and the [[Atari Falcon]]. It was also used in Unix [[workstation]]s such as the [[Sun Microsystems]] [[Sun-3#Sun-3x|Sun-3x]] line of desktop workstations (the earlier \"sun3\" used a 68020), [[Apollo Computer]]'s [[Apollo/Domain|DN3500 and DN4500]] workstations,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web-docs.gsi.de/~kraemer/COLLECTION/www.hunkler.com/aegis/aegis_sg.html|title=Survival Guide for Apollo Workstations|author=Tim Hunkler|date=July 1996|access-date=2022-10-13}}</ref> [[laser printer]]s and the Nortel Networks [[DMS-100]] telephone central office switch. More recently{{when|date=December 2022}}, the 68030 core has also been adapted by [[Freescale]] into a [[microcontroller]] for embedded applications.\n\n[[LeCroy Corporation|LeCroy]] has used the 68EC030 in certain models of their 9300 Series digital oscilloscopes including “C” suffix models{{R|ReferenceA|p=87-88}} and high performance 9300 Series models,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">LeCroy 1996 Test & Measurement Product Catalog, 9300 Series Hardware Options, Mega Waveform Processing, Pages 66-67</ref> along with the Mega Waveform Processing hardware option for 68020-based 9300 Series models.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Variants==\nThe 68EC030 is a low cost version of the 68030, the difference between the two being that the 68EC030 omits the on-chip [[memory management unit]] (MMU) and is thus essentially an upgraded 68020.\n\nThe 68EC030 was used as the CPU for the low-cost model of the [[Amiga 4000]], and on a number of CPU accelerator cards for the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] line of computers. It was also used in the [[Cisco Systems]] [[Cisco 2500 series|2500 Series]] router, a small-to-medium enterprise computer internetworking appliance. Additionally it was also used as the primary processor in a number of [[Alpha Microsystems]] Eagle mini-computers.\n\nThe 50&nbsp;MHz speed is exclusive to the ceramic [[pin grid array|PGA]] package, the plastic '030 stopped at 40&nbsp;MHz.\n\n==Technical data==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| CPU [[clock rate]] || 16, 20, 25, 33, 40, 50&nbsp;MHz, except for MC68EC030 available in 25 and 40&nbsp;MHz ||<ref name=m30/>\n|-\n|             || Internal [[modified Harvard architecture#Split-cache (or almost-von-Neumann) architecture|split-cache modified Harvard architecture]]     ||<ref name=m30>{{cite web|url=http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=MC68030|title=MC68030 Product Summary Page|date=2012|website=Freescale|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006204732/http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=MC68030|archive-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n| Address bus || 32 bit ||<ref name=cw>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/68030/index.html|website=cpu-world.com|title=Motorola 68030 (MC68030) microprocessor family|date=November 17, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n| Data bus    || 32 bit ||<ref name=cw/>\n|-\n| Cache       || 256 bytes each for instruction and data, 16 lines of 4 entries of 4 bytes each, direct mapped ||<ref name=m30/><ref name=\"um\"/>\n|-\n|             || dynamic bus sizing ||<ref name=m30/>\n|-\n|             || burst memory interface ||<ref name=m30/>\n|-\n| Performance || 18 MIPS @ 50&nbsp;MHz ||<ref name=m30/>\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Macintosh models grouped by CPU type]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cpu-collection.de/?tn=1&l0=cl&l1=68030 68030 images and descriptions at cpu-collection.de]\n*[http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=MC68030 Official information about the Freescale MC68030 microcontroller]\n*[http://www.bitsavers.org/components/motorola/68000/ Motorola 68k family data sheets at bitsavers.org]\n*[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZtULPYBnZ2ZnI8LJavVCWvJ2v2n0UO8J ''Extraordinarily'' rare, pictures, (Shared) of the 68030 emulator pre-silicon breadboard.

It is the successor to the [[Motorola 68030|68030]] and is followed by the [[Motorola 68060|68060]], skipping the 68050. In keeping with general Motorola naming, the 68040 is often referred to as simply the '040 (pronounced ''oh-four-oh'' or ''oh-forty'').\n\nThe 68040 was the first [[Motorola 68000 family|680x0 family]] member with an on-chip [[Floating-point unit|Floating-Point Unit]] (FPU). It thus included all of the functionality that previously required external chips, namely the FPU and [[Memory management unit|Memory Management Unit]] (MMU), which was added in the 68030. It also had split instruction and data caches of 4 [[kilobyte]]s each.  It was fully [[Instruction pipeline|pipelined]], with six stages.\n\nVersions of the 68040 were created for specific market segments, including the [[Motorola 68040#68LC040|68LC040]], which removed the FPU, and the [[Motorola 68040#68EC040|68EC040]], which removed both the FPU and MMU. Motorola had intended the EC variant for embedded use, but embedded processors during the 68040's time did not need the power of the 68040, so EC variants of the 68020 and 68030 continued to be common in designs.\n\nMotorola produced several speed grades. The 16&nbsp;MHz and 20&nbsp;MHz parts were never qualified (XC designation) and used as prototyping samples. 25&nbsp;MHz and 33&nbsp;MHz grades featured across the whole line, but until around 2000 the 40&nbsp;MHz grade was only for the \"full\" 68040. A planned 50&nbsp;MHz grade was canceled after it exceeded the [[Thermal Design Power|thermal design envelope]].\n\n==Usage==\nIn [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] computers, the 68040 was introduced in the [[Macintosh Quadra]], which was named for the chip. The fastest 68040 processor was clocked at 40&nbsp;MHz and it was used only in the Quadra 840AV. The more expensive models in the (short-lived) [[Macintosh Centris]] line also used the 68040, while the cheaper Quadra, Centris and [[Macintosh Performa]] used the [[Motorola 68LC040|68LC040]]. The 68040 was also used in other [[personal computer]]s, such as the [[Amiga 4000]] and [[Amiga 4000T]], as well as a number of [[workstation]]s, [[Alpha Microsystems]] servers, the [[HP 9000]]/400 series, [[NCR Corporation]]'s TOWER 32/750, 32/825 and 32/850,<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Fitzgerald |first=Michael |date=May 6, 1991 |title=NCR promises Tower line lives |magazine=Computerworld |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_computerworld_1991-05-06_25_18/page/n115 |access-date=31 Mar 2023}}</ref> [[Apollo Computer]]'s [[Apollo/Domain|DN5500]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web-docs.gsi.de/~kraemer/COLLECTION/www.hunkler.com/aegis/aegis_sg.html|title=Survival Guide for Apollo Workstations|author=Tim Hunkler|date=July 1996|access-date=2022-10-13}}</ref> and later versions of the [[NeXT]] computer.\n\nThe 68040 processor is used in the [[Flight management system|flight management computers]] (FMC) aboard many [[Boeing 737]] aircraft, including all [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Next Generation]] and [[Boeing 737 MAX|MAX]] models.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brady |first=Chris |title=The Boeing 737 Flight Management Computer |url=http://www.b737.org.uk/fmc.htm |access-date=24 June 2022 |website=The Boeing 737 Technical Site}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe 68040 ran into the transistor budget limit early in design. While the MMU did not take many transistors—indeed, having it on the same die as the CPU actually saved on transistors—the FPU certainly did. Motorola's [[Motorola 68881|68882]] external FPU was known as a very high performance unit and Motorola did not wish to risk integrators using the \"LC\" version with a 68882 instead of the more profitable full \"RC\" unit. (For information on Motorola's multiprocessing model with the 680x0 series, see [[Motorola 68020]].) The FPU in the 68040 was thus made incapable of IEEE [[transcendental function]]s, which had been supported by both the 68881 and 68882 and were used by the popular fractal generating software of the time and little else. The Motorola floating point support package (FPSP) emulated these instructions in software under interrupt. As this was an exception handler, heavy use of the transcendental functions caused severe performance penalties.\n\nHeat was always a problem throughout the 68040's life. While it delivered over four times the per-clock performance of the 68020 and 68030, the chip's complexity and power requirements came from a large die and large caches. This affected the scaling of the processor and it was never able to run with a clock rate exceeding 40&nbsp;MHz. A 50&nbsp;MHz variant was planned, but canceled. [[Overclocking]] enthusiasts reported success reaching 50&nbsp;MHz using  a 100&nbsp;MHz oscillator instead of an 80&nbsp;MHz part and the then novel technique of adding oversized heat sinks with fans.\n\nThe 68040 offered the same features as the [[Intel 80486]], but on a clock-for-clock basis could significantly outperform the Intel chip in integer and floating point instructions.<ref>{{cite web|title=CISC: The Intel 80486 vs. The Motorola MC68040|url=http://textfiles.meulie.net/computers/486vs040.txt|access-date=20 May 2013|date=July 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbs.ingedigit.com.ve/TechInfo/68040.Microprocessor.html|title=68040 Microprocessor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216013510/http://www.bbs.ingedigit.com.ve/TechInfo/68040.Microprocessor.html|archive-date=16 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n===68EC040===\nThe ''68EC040'' is a version of the Motorola 68040 microprocessor, intended for embedded controllers (EC). It differs from the 68040 in that it has neither an FPU nor an MMU. This makes it less expensive and it draws less power. The 68EC040 was used in Cisco switch [[Supervisor Engine (Cisco)|Supervisor Engine I]] that is the heart of models 2900, 2948G, 2980G, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, 6500 and 7600.\n\n===68LC040===\n[[Image:Motorola68040die.jpg|thumb|180px|Die of a Motorola 68LC040]]\nThe ''68LC040'' is a ''low cost'' version of the Motorola 68040 [[microprocessor]] with no FPU. This makes it less expensive and it draws less power. Although the CPU now fits into a feature chart more like the Motorola 68030, it continues to include the 68040's [[CPU cache|caches]] and [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] and is thus significantly faster than the 68030.\n\nSome [[Mask (computing)|mask]] revisions of the 68LC040 contained a [[Software bug|bug]] that prevents the chip  from operating correctly when a software FPU [[emulator]] is used. According to Motorola's errata,<ref>{{cite web|title=Documentation Clarification for MC68040|url=http://www.freescale.com/files/microcontrollers/doc/errata/MC68040DE_D.txt|website=Freescale|access-date=20 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314132128/http://www.freescale.com/files/microcontrollers/doc/errata/MC68040DE_D.txt|archive-date=14 March 2012}}</ref> any chip with a mask set 2E71M or later does not contain the bug. This new mask was introduced in mid-1995 and converted the 68LC040 chip to MC status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freescale.com/files/shared/doc/pcn/PCNR00274.html |title=E71M and E42K MC-Qualified Mask Sets |website=Freescale |access-date=24 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302145418/http://www.freescale.com/files/shared/doc/pcn/PCNR00274.html|archive-date=2 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe buggy revisions are typically found in 68LC040-based [[Apple Macintosh]] computers. Chips with mask set 2E23G (as used in the LC 475) have been confirmed to be faulty. The fault relates to pending writes being lost when the F-line exception is triggered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gnats.netbsd.org/13078 |title=NetBSD Problem Report #13078: Mac 68LC040 problem |publisher=Gnats.netbsd.org |access-date=24 July 2012}}</ref> The 68040 cannot update its microcode in the manner of modern x86 chips. This means that the only way to use software that requires floating-point functionality is to replace the buggy 68LC040 with a later revision, or a full 68040.\n\n===Feature table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The 68060 design was led by Joe Circello.\n\nThe 68060 shares most architectural features with the [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium]]. Both have a very similar [[superscalar]] [[tree traversal|in-order]] dual [[instruction pipeline]] configuration,<ref name = Foundations/> and an instruction decoder which breaks down complex instructions into simpler ones before execution. However, a significant difference is that the 68060 FPU is not pipelined and is therefore up to three times slower than the Pentium in floating point applications. In contrast to that, integer multiplications and bit shifting instructions are significantly faster on the 68060. The 68060 has the ability to execute simple instructions in the [[address generation unit]] (AGU) and thereby supply the result two cycles before the [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]. In the development of the 68060, large amounts of commercial compiled code were analyzed for clues as to which instructions would be the best candidates for performance optimization.\n\nAgainst the Pentium, the 68060 can perform better on mixed code; Pentium's decoder cannot issue an FP instruction every opportunity and hence the FPU is not superscalar as the ALUs were. If the 68060's non-pipelined FPU can accept an instruction, it can be issued one by the decoder. This means that optimizing for the 68060 is easier: no rules prevent FP instructions from being issued whenever was convenient for the programmer other than well understood instruction latencies. However, with properly optimized and scheduled code, the Pentium's FPU is capable of double the clock for clock throughput of the 68060's FPU.\n\nThe 68060 is the last development of the [[68000 family]] for general purpose use, abandoned in favor of the [[PowerPC]] chips. It saw use in some late-model [[Amiga]] machines and Amiga accelerator cards as well as some [[Atari ST]] clones and [[Atari Falcon|Falcon]] accelerator boards (CT60/CT63/CT60e, the latter of which was created in 2015), and very late models of the [[Alpha Microsystems]] multiuser computers before their migration to x86, but [[Apple Inc.]] and the [[Unix]] world had moved onto various [[RISC]] platforms by the time the 68060 was available.

There were, however, no major overhauls of the core architecture. Similarly, the Motorola [[Motorola 68030|68030]] represents a process improvement on the [[Motorola 68020|68020]] with the MMU and a small [[CPU cache|data cache]] (256 bytes) moved on-chip. The 68030 was released in speed ratings up to 50 MHz.\n\nThe jump from the 68000/68010 to the 68020/68030, however, represents a major overhaul, with innumerable individual changes.\n\nBy the time the 68060 was in production, Motorola had abandoned development of the 68000 family in favor of the [[PowerPC]]. The 68060 is the last 68000 family processor from Motorola.\n\n[[Signetics]] (Philips) produced a 68000-based variant that they somewhat confusingly named the [[68070]]. It contains a modestly-improved 68000 CPU, a simple on-chip MMU and an [[I²C]] bus controller.

It was designed by [[Motorola]]'s Terry Ritter and Joel Boney and introduced in 1978. Although source compatible with the earlier [[Motorola 6800]], the 6809 offered significant improvements over it and 8-bit contemporaries like the [[MOS Technology 6502]], including a hardware multiplication instruction, 16-bit arithmetic, system and user [[stack register]]s allowing re-entrant code, improved [[interrupt]]s, position-independent code and an [[orthogonal instruction set]] architecture with a comprehensive set of addressing modes.\n\nThe 6809 was among the most powerful (and most expensive) 8-bit processors of its era. In 1980 a 6809 in single-unit quantities was {{US$|long=no|37}} compared to {{US$|long=no|9}} for a [[Zilog Z80]] and {{US$|long=no|6}} for a 6502.{{sfnb|Ancrona|1981}} It was launched when a new generation of 16-bit processors were coming to market, like the [[Intel 8086]], and 32-bit designs were on the horizon, including Motorola's own [[Motorola 68000|68000]]. It was not feature competitive with newer designs and not price competitive with older ones.\n\nThe 6809 was used in the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]], [[Dragon 32/64]], [[SuperPET]], [[ENER 1000]], the [https://museum.eecs.yorku.ca/items/show/31 Cybernex LC3], and [[Thomson computers|Thomson MO/TO]] home computers, the [[Vectrex]] game console, and early 1980s arcade machines including ''[[Star Wars (1983 video game)|Star Wars]]'', ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]'', ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'', and ''[[Gyruss]]''. 1990s [[WMS Industries|Williams]] pinball machines are equipped with [[Williams Pinball Controller|WPC]]-series controller boards based on 68B09.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Williams WPC - PinWiki |url=https://pinwiki.com/wiki/index.php/Williams_WPC |access-date=2022-07-30 |website=pinwiki.com}}</ref> Series II of the [[Fairlight CMI]] digital audio workstation and Konami's ''[[Time Pilot '84]]'' arcade game each use dual 6809 processors.<ref>{{cite web |title=Konami Dual 6809 Based Hardware |url=http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=557 |website=System 16}}</ref> [[Hitachi]] was a major user of the 6809 and later produced an updated version as the [[Hitachi 6309]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Motorola_6809_die.JPG|thumb|[[Die (integrated circuit)|Die]] of Motorola 6809]]\n\n===6800 and 6502===\nThe [[Motorola 6800]] was designed beginning in 1971 and released in 1974. In overall design terms, it has a strong resemblance to other CPUs that were designed from the start as 8-bit designs, like the [[Intel 8080]].{{efn|In contrast to other early CPU designs that attempted to emulate [[minicomputer]] instruction sets and were much more complex.}} It was initially fabricated using early [[NMOS logic]], which normally required several different [[power supply]] voltages. A key feature was an on-chip [[voltage doubler]] that allowed it to run on a single {{val|+5 |u=V}} supply, a major advantage over its competitors like the [[Intel 8080]] which required {{val|-5 |u=V}}, {{val|+5 |u=V}}, {{val|-12 |u=V}} and [[Ground (electricity)|ground]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cpu-world.com/info/Pinouts/8080.html |title= 8080A microprocessor - DIP 40 package |website=CPU World}}</ref>\n\nThe 6800 was initially fabricated using the then-current [[contact lithography]] process. In this process, the [[photomask]] is placed in direct contact with the [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]], exposed, and then lifted off. There was a small chance that some of the etching material would be left on the wafer when it was lifted, causing future chips patterned with the mask to fail. For complex multi-patterned designs like a CPU, this led to about 90% of the chips failing when tested. To make a profit on the small number of chips that did work, the prices for the working models had to be fairly high, on the order of hundreds of dollars in small quantities.<ref name=milestone>{{cite web |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/moores-law-milestones |title=Moore's Law Milestones |website=IEEE|date=30 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nSome of the 6800's designers were convinced that a lower-cost system would be key to widespread acceptance. Notable among them was [[Chuck Peddle]], who was sent on sales trips and saw prospective customers repeatedly reject the design as being too expensive for their intended uses. He began a project to produce a much less costly design, but Motorola's management proved uninterested and eventually told him to stop working on it. Peddle and some other members of the 6800 team left Motorola for [[MOS Technology]] and introduced this design in 1975 as the [[MOS Technology 6502]].<ref>{{Cite interview |title=Oral History of Chuck Peddle |last= Peddle |first= Chuck |interviewer = Doug Fairbairn and Stephen Diamond |date=12 June 2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHF9lMseP8  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/enHF9lMseP8| archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live|ref=CITEREFInterview2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nThe 6800 was initially sold at {{US$|long=no|360}} in single-unit quantities,<ref name = \"MC6850 1975\">{{Cite journal | title = Motorola microprocessor set is 1 MHz n-MOS | journal = Control Engineering | volume = 21 | issue = 11 | page =11 | date = November 1974}} MC6800 microprocessor price was $360.

It remained uncompetitive and sales prospects dimmed. The introduction of the [[Micralign]] to Motorola's lines allowed further reductions and by 1981 the price of the then-current 6800P was slightly less than the equivalent 6502, at least in single-unit quantities.{{sfnb|Ancrona|1981}} By that point, however, the 6502 had sold tens of millions of units and the 6800 had been largely forgotten.\n\n===6809===\nWhile the 6502 began to take over the 6800's market, [[Intel]] was experiencing the same problem when the upstart [[Zilog Z80]] began to steal sales from the [[Intel 8080]]. Both Motorola and Intel began new design cycles to leapfrog those designs. Intel responded by quickly introducing a small but practical upgrade of the 8080 as the [[Intel 8085|8085]], which made it less expensive to use and more competitive with the Z80. They also began to design a series of 16-bit processors, which emerged as the [[Intel 8086]] in 1978. Motorola also began the design of a similar high-end design, in the MACSS project,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/articleview.php?item=415 |website=The Vintage Technology Association |title= Motorola 68000 |date=17 May 2007}}</ref> but did not initially consider an improved 8-bit design. But when they polled their existing 6800 customers, they found that many were not willing to pay for a 16-bit design for their simple needs. This led to the decision to produce a greatly improved but compatible 8-bit design that became the 6809.{{sfn|Ritter|Boney|1979|pp=20, 26}}\n\nAnalysis of 6800 code demonstrated that loads and stores were the vast majority of all the time in CPU terms, accounting for 39% of all the operations in the code they examined. In contrast, mathematical operations were relatively rare, only 2.8% of the code. However, a careful examination of the loads and stores noted that many of these were being combined with adds and subtracts, revealing that a significant amount of those math operations were being performed on 16-bit values. This led to the decision to include basic 16-bit mathematics in the new design: load, store, add, and subtract. Similarly, increments and decrements accounted for only 6.1% of the code, but these almost always occurred within loops where each one was performed many times. This led to the addition of post-incrementing and pre-decrementing modes using the [[index register]]s.{{sfn|Ritter|Boney|1979|p=26}}\n\nThe main goal for the new design was to support [[position-independent code]]. Motorola's market was mostly [[embedded system]]s and similar single-purpose systems, which often ran programs that were very similar to those on other platforms. Development for these systems often took the form of collecting a series of pre-rolled [[subroutine]]s and combining them together. However, as [[assembly language]] is generally written starting at a \"base address\", combining pre-written modules normally required a lengthy process of changing constants (or \"equates\") that pointed to key locations in the code.{{sfn|Ritter|Boney|1979|pp=20, 24}}\n\nMotorola's idea was to eliminate this task and make the building-block concept much more practical. System integrators would simply combine off-the-shelf code in ROMs to handle common tasks. Libraries of common routines like [[floating point]] arithmetic, graphics primitives, [[LZ77 and LZ78|Lempel-Ziv compression]], and so forth would be available to license, combine together along with custom code, and burn to ROM.{{sfn|Ritter|Boney|1979|pp=20, 24}}{{efn|Other examples are matrix arithmetic, Huffman encoding/decoding, statistical functions, string searching (e.g. by the [[Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm|Boyer-Moore algorithm]]) and tree structure management. A larger example is found in Motorola's 6809 programming manual, which contains the full listing of ''assist09'', a so-called [[Resident monitor|monitor]], a miniature operating system intended to be burned in ROM.{{sfn|Manual|1983|p=B.1}}}}\n\nIn previous processor designs, including the 6800, there was a mix of ways to refer to memory locations. Some of these were relative to the current location in memory or to a value in an index register, while others were absolute, a 16-bit value that referred to a physical location in memory. The former style allows code to be moved because the address it references will move along with the code. The absolute locations do not; code that uses this style of addressing will have to be recompiled if it moves. To address this, the 6809 filled out its instruction opcodes so that there were more instances of relative addressing where possible.{{sfn|Manual|1983|p=1.2}}\n\nAs an example, the 6800 included a special \"direct\" [[addressing mode]] that was used to make code smaller and faster; instead of a memory address having 16-bits and thus requiring two bytes to store, direct addresses were only 8-bits long. The downside was that it could only refer to memory within a 256-byte window, the \"[[direct page]]\", which was normally at the bottom of memory - the 6502 referred to this as \"[[zero page addressing]]\". The 6809 added a new 8-bit DP register, for \"direct page\". Code that formerly had to be in the [[zero page]] could now be moved anywhere in memory as long as the DP was changed to point to its new location.{{sfn|Manual|1983|p=1.2}}\n\nUsing DP solved the problem of referring to addresses within the code, but data is generally located some distance from the code, outside ROM. To solve the problem of easily referring to data while remaining position independent, the 6809 added a variety of new addressing modes. Among these was program-counter-relative addressing which allowed any memory location to be referred to by its location relative to the instruction. Additionally, the [[Call stack|stack]] was more widely used, so that a program in ROM could set aside a block of memory in RAM, set the SP to be the base of the block, and then refer to data within it using relative values.{{sfn|Manual|1983|pp=2.1-2.4}}\n\nTo aid this type of access, the 6809 renamed the SP to U for \"user\", and added a second stack pointer, S, for \"system\".{{sfn|Manual|1983|p=1.3}} The idea was user programs would use U while the CPU itself would use S to store data during [[subroutine|subroutine calls]]. This allowed system code to be easily called by changing S without affecting any other running program. For instance, a program calling a floating-point routine in ROM would place its data on the U stack and then call the routine, which could then perform the calculations using data on its own private stack pointed to by S, and then return, leaving the U stack untouched.{{sfn|Manual|1983|p=1.3}}\n\nAnother reason for the expanded stack access was to support [[reentrant (subroutine)|reentrant]] code, code that can be called from various different programs concurrently without concern for coordination between them, or that can recursively call itself.{{sfn|Ritter|Boney|1979|p=30}} This makes the construction of [[operating system]]s much easier; the operating system had its own stack, and the processor could quickly switch between a user application and the operating system simply by changing which stack pointer it was using. This also makes servicing [[interrupt]]s much easier for the same reason.{{sfn|Manual|1983|loc=4}} The 6809 adds a fast [[interrupt request]] (FIRQ) interrupt that saves only the program counter and condition code register before calling the interrupt code, whereas the IRQ interrupt saves all registers, taking additional cycles, then more to unwind the stack on exit.{{sfn|Manual|1983|p=1.9}}\n\nThe 6809 includes one of the earliest dedicated hardware multipliers.{{sfn|Ritter|Boney|1979|p=36}} It takes 8-bit numbers in the A and B accumulators and produces a result in A:B, known collectively as D.{{sfn|Manual|1983|p=1.1}}\n\n===Market acceptance===\nMuch of the design had been based around the market concept of building-block code. But the market for pre-rolled ROM modules never materialized: Motorola's only released example was the MC6839 floating-point ROM. The industry as a whole solved the problem of integrating code modules from separate sources by using [[Relocation (computing)|automatic relocating linkers and loaders]], which is the solution used today.<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Levine |author-first=John R. |author-link=John R.

While process improvements meant it could be fabricated cheaper than the original 6800, those same improvements were being applied to the other designs and so the relative cost remained the same. Such was the case in practice; in 1981 the 6809 sold in single-unit quantities for roughly six times the price of a 6502.{{sfnb|Ancrona|1981}} For those systems that needed some of its special features, like the hardware multiplier, the system could justify its price, but in most roles, it was overlooked.\n\nAnother factor in its low use was the presence of newer designs with significantly higher performance. Among these was the [[Intel 8086]], released the same year, and its lower-cost version, the [[Intel 8088]] of 1979. A feeling for the problem can be seen in the [[Byte Sieve]] assembly language results against other common designs from the era (taken from 1981<ref>{{cite magazine |title=A High-Level Language Benchmark |first=Jim |last=Gilbreath |magazine=Byte |date=September 1981 |pages=180–198 |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-09/page/n181}}</ref> and 1983<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Eratosthenes Revisited: Once More through the Sieve |first1=Jim |last1=Gilbreath |first2=Gary |last2=Gilbreath |magazine=[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] |date=January 1983 |pages=283–325 |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1983-01/page/n291 |volume=8 |issue=1}}\n</ref>):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Byte Sieve comparison\n|-\n!

For those where price was not the primary concern, but outright performance was, the new designs outperformed it by as much as an [[order of magnitude]].\n\nEven before the 6809 was released, in 1976 Motorola had launched its own advanced CPU project, then known as Motorola Advanced Computer System on Silicon project, or MACSS. Although too late to be chosen for the [[IBM PC]] project, when MACSS appeared as the [[Motorola 68000]] in 1979 it took any remaining interest in the 6809. Motorola soon announced that their future 8-bit systems would be powered by cut-down versions of the 68000 rather than further improved versions of the 6809.\n\n===Major uses===\n[[File:TRS-80 Color Computer 1 front right.jpg|thumb|upright|TRS-80 Color Computer]]\n\nIts first major use was in the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]], which happened largely by accident. Motorola had been asked to design a color-capable [[computer terminal]] for an online farm-aid project, a system known as \"AgVision\". [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]] ([[Radio Shack]]) was brought in as a retail partner and sold them under the name \"VideoTex\", but the project was ultimately canceled shortly after its introduction in 1980.<ref name=\"ElencoAgVision\">{{cite news | url=https://vintagecomputer.ca/agvision-videotex-terminal/ | title=AgVision Videotex terminal | work=Vintage Computer | date=2016-12-22 | access-date=16 April 2018 }}</ref> Tandy then re-worked the design to produce a [[home computer]], which became one of the 6809's most notable design wins.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=G.

The result was later picked up by Commodore, who sold it as the [[Commodore PET#SuperPET 9000 series|SuperPET]], or MicroMainframe in Europe. These were relatively popular in the mid-1980s before the introduction of the [[PC clone]] market took over the programming role for most users.\n\nOther popular home computer uses include the [[FM-7|Fujitsu FM-7]], Canon CX-1, [[Dragon 32/64]], and the [[Thomson TO7]] series. It was also available as an option on the [[Acorn System 2]], 3 and 4 computers. Most [[SS-50 bus]] designs that had been built around the 6800 also had options for the 6809 or switched to it exclusively. Examples include machines from [[SWTPC]], [[Gimix]], [[Smoke Signal Broadcasting]], etc. Motorola also build a series of [[EXORmacs]] and EXORset development systems.\n\n[[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] produced its own 6809-based machines, the MB-6890 and later the S1. These were primarily for the Japanese market, but some were exported to and sold in [[Australia]], where the MB-6890 was dubbed the \"Peach\", probably in reference to the [[Apple II]]. The S1 was notable in that it contained [[paging]] hardware extending the 6809's native 64 [[kilobyte]] addressing range to a full 1 [[megabyte]] in 4 KB pages. It was similar in this to machines produced by SWTPC, Gimix, and several other suppliers. TSC produced a Unix-like operating system [[uniFlex]] which ran only on such machines. [[OS-9]] Level II, also took advantage of such memory management facilities. Most other computers of the time with more than 64 KB of memory addressing were limited to [[bank switching]] where much if not all the 64 KB was simply swapped for another section of memory, although in the case of the 6809, Motorola offered their own MC6829 [[Memory management unit|MMU]] design mapping 2 megabytes in 2 KB pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_motoroladaMicroprocessorsDataManual_80083566 |title=1981 Motorola Microprocessors Data Manual |access-date=2 April 2018 |year= 1981 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vectrex-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|upright|Vectrex home video game console]]\nThe 6809 also saw use in various [[videogame]] systems. Notable among these, in the 68A09 incarnation, was the unique [[vector graphics]]-based [[Vectrex]] home videogame machine. It was also used in the Milton Bradley Expansion (MBX) system (an arcade console for the [[TI-99/4A]] home computer), and a series of [[arcade game]]s released during the early to mid-1980s. [[WMS Industries|Williams Electronics]] was a prolific user of the processor, which was deployed in ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]'', ''[[Stargate (1981 video game)|Stargate]]'', ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'', ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', ''[[Sinistar]]'', and other games. The 6809 CPU forms the core of the successful [[Williams Pinball Controller]]. The KONAMI-1 is a modified 6809 used by [[Konami]] in ''[[Roc'n Rope]]'', ''[[Gyruss]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons (video game)|The Simpsons]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/cpu/konami/konami.c.html |title=konami: Portable Konami cpu emulator|author=Nicola Salmoria and the MAME Team|access-date=2012-10-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004145431/http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/cpu/konami/konami.c.html |archive-date=2012-10-04 }}</ref>\n\nSeries II of the [[Fairlight CMI]] (computer musical instrument) used dual 6809 CPUs running [[OS-9]], and also used one 6809 CPU per voice card. The 6809 was often employed in music synthesizers from other manufacturers such as Oberheim ([[Oberheim Xpander|Xpander]], [[Oberheim Matrix synthesizers|Matrix 6/12/1000]]), PPG (Wave 2/2.2/2.3, Waveterm A), and [[Ensoniq]] ([[Ensoniq Mirage|Mirage]] sampler, SDP-1, [[Ensoniq ESQ-1|ESQ-1]], [[Ensoniq SQ-80|SQ-80]]). The latter used the 6809E as their main CPU. The (E) version was used in order to synchronize the microprocessor's clock to the sound chip (Ensoniq 5503 DOC) in those machines; in the ESQ-1 and SQ-80 the 68B09E was used, requiring a dedicated arbiter logic in order to ensure 1&nbsp;MHz bus timing when accessing the DOC chip.\n\nIn contrast to earlier Motorola products, the 6809 did not see widespread use in the [[microcontroller]] field. It was used in [[traffic signal]] controllers made in the 1980s by several different manufacturers,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert J. Simpson|author2=Raveendran Paramesran|title=Advanced 8-bit Microprocessor, MC6809: Its Software, Hardware, Architecture & Interfacing Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orNQAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-3083-09-7}}</ref> as well as Motorola's SMARTNET and SMARTZONE Trunked Central Controllers (so dubbed the \"6809 Controller\").

Faster versions were produced later by Hitachi. With little to improve, the 6809 marks the end of the evolution of Motorola's 8-bit processors; Motorola intended that future 8-bit products would be based on an 8-bit data bus version of the 68000 (the [[Motorola 68008|68008]]). A microcontroller version with a slightly modified instruction set, the [[Motorola 68HC11|6811]], was discontinued as late as the second decade of the 21st century.\n\nThe [[Hitachi 6309]] is an enhanced version of the 6809 with extra registers and additional instructions, including block move, additional multiply instructions, and division.\n\n===Legacy===\nMotorola spun off its microprocessor division in 2004. The division changed its name to Freescale and was subsequently acquired by [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]].\n\nNeither Motorola nor Hitachi produce 6809 processors or derivatives anymore. 6809 cores are available in [[VHDL]] and can be programmed into an [[FPGA]] and used as an embedded processor with speed ratings up to 40&nbsp;MHz.{{citation needed|reason=Cite source for this speed rating.|date=December 2017}} Some 6809 opcodes also live on in the [[Freescale]] embedded processors. In 2015, Freescale authorized [[Rochester Electronics]] to start manufacturing the MC6809 once again as a drop-in replacement and copy of the original NMOS device. Freescale supplied Rochester the original [[GDSII]] physical design database. At the end of 2016, Rochester's MC6809 (including the MC68A09, and MC68B09) is fully qualified and available in production.\n\nAustralian developer John Kent has synthesized the Motorola 6809 CPU in hardware description language (HDL).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.optushome.com.au/jekent/ |title=John Kent's Home Web Page }}</ref> This has made possible the use of the 6809 core at much higher clock speeds than were available with the original 6809.

Like most 8-bit microprocessors, the 6809 implementation is a [[register-transfer level]] machine, using a central [[Programmable logic array|PLA]] to implement much of the instruction decoding as well as parts of the sequencing.\n\nLike the 6800 and 6502, the 6809 uses a [[two-phase clock]] to gate the latches. This two-phase clock cycle is used as a full [[machine cycle]] in these processors. Simple instructions can execute in as little as two or three such cycles. The 6809 has an internal two-phase clock generator (needing only an external crystal) whereas the 6809E needs an external clock generator. There are variants such as the 68A09(E) and 68B09(E); the internal letter indicates the processor's rated clock speed.\n\nThe 6800, 6502, the 6809's clock system differs from other processors of the era. For instance, the Z80 uses a single external clock and the internal steps of the instruction process continue on each transition. This means that the external clock generally runs much faster; 680x designs generally ran at 1 or 2&nbsp;MHz while the Z80 generally ran at 2 or 4. Internally, the 680x's divided the external clock frequency by four to create the system clock; so a 1&nbsp;MHz 6809 would have a 4&nbsp;MHz crystal or clock signal.  Typically, on an instruction-for-instruction basis, they ran roughly twice as fast, when comparing the external clocks to other microprocessors.\n\nThe advantage to the 680x style access was that [[dynamic RAM]] chips of the era generally ran at 2&nbsp;MHz. Due to the cycle timing, there were periods of the internal clock where the memory bus was guaranteed to be free. This allowed the computer designer to interleave access to memory between the CPU and an external device, say a [[direct memory access]] controller, or more commonly, a [[graphics chip]]. By running both chips at 1&nbsp;MHz and stepping them one after the other, they could share access to the memory without any additional complexity or circuitry.  Depending on version and speed grade, approximately 40–60% of a single clock cycle is typically available for memory access in a 6800, 6502, or 6809.\n\n===Registers and instructions===\n[[File:6809 Internal Registers.svg|thumb|300px|6809 programming model, showing the [[processor register]]s ]]\nThe original 6800 included two [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]s, A and B, a single [[16-bit computing|16-bit]] [[index register]], X, a 16-bit [[program counter]], PC, a 16-bit [[stack pointer]], SP, and an 8-bit [[status register]]. The 6809 added a second index register, Y, a second stack pointer, U (while renaming the original S), and allowed the A and B registers to be treated as a single 16-bit accumulator, D. It also added another 8-bit register, DP, to set the base address of the direct page. These additions were invisible to 6800 code, and the 6809 was 100% [[source-code compatibility|source-compatible]] with earlier code.{{sfn|Manual|1983|p=1.1}}\n\nAnother significant addition was program-counter-relative addressing for all data manipulation instructions. This was a key addition for [[position-independent code]], as it allows data to be referred to relative to the instruction, and as long as the resulting memory location exists then the instructions can be moved in memory freely. The system retained its previous addressing modes as well, although in the new [[assembler language]], what were previously separate instructions were now considered to be different addressing modes on other instructions. This reduced the number of instructions from the 6800's 78 instructions to the 6809's 59. These new modes had the same opcodes as the previously separate instruction, so these changes were only visible to the programmer working on new code.{{sfn|Manual|1983|p=1.2}}\n\nThe [[instruction set]] and register complement are highly [[Orthogonal (computing)|orthogonal]], making the 6809 easier to program than contemporaries. Like the 6800, the 6809 includes an undocumented address bus test instruction which came to be nicknamed [[Halt and Catch Fire (computing)|Halt and Catch Fire (HCF)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/hoglet67/6809Decoder/wiki/Undocumented-6809-Behaviours |title=Undocumented 6809 Behaviours |author=David Banks}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://student.brighton.ac.uk/burks/pcinfo/hardware/cpu.htm |title=Great Microprocessors of the Present and the Past|author=John Bayko|access-date=2013-07-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130701061311/https://student.brighton.ac.uk/burks/pcinfo/hardware/cpu.htm |archive-date=2013-07-01 }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite magazine |title=Ancrona is better |page= 111 | type=Advertising |magazine= Radio-Electronics |date=April 1981 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Electronics/80s/1981/Radio-Electronics-1981-04.pdf |volume=54 |number=4 |ref=CITEREFAncrona1981}}\n* {{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_motorola68_13419254 |title=MC6809-MC6809E Microprocessor Programming Manual |publisher=Motorola |date=May 1983 |ref=CITEREFManual1983}}\n* {{cite magazine\n |magazine=[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]\n |date=January 1979 \n |first1= Terry |last1=Ritter |first2=Joel |last2=Boney\n |title=The 6809, Part 1: Design Philosophy\n |pages=14–42\n |url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1979-01/page/n15\n |volume=4 |issue=1\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Datasheets and manuals\n* ''[https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_motorolada_3224333 MC6809 Datasheet]''; Motorola; 36 pages; 1983.\n* ''[https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_motorolada_2239908 MC6809E Datasheet]''; Motorola; 34 pages.\n* ''[https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_motoroladaMicroprocessorsDataManual_80083566 Motorola 8-bit Microprocessors Data Book]''; Motorola; 1182 pages; 1981.\n;Books\n* ''6809 Assembly Language Programming''; 1st Ed; Lance Leventhal; 579 pages; 1981; {{ISBN|0-931988-35-7}}. <small>[https://archive.org/details/6809AssemblyLanguageProgramming/ (archive)]</small>\n* ''The MC6809 Cookbook''; 1st Ed; Carl Warren; 180 pages; 1980; {{ISBN|0-8306-9683-0}}. <small>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190714002120/http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/Documents/Books/The%20MC6809%20CookBook%20(TAB%20BOOKS%20Inc).pdf (archive)]</small>\n* ''Advanced 8-bit Microprocessor: MC6809: Its Software, Hardware, Architecture and Interfacing Techniques''; 1st Ed; Robert Simpson; 274 pages; 1998; {{ISBN|978-9813083097}}\n;Magazines\n* '' A Microprocessor for the Revolution: The 6809''; Terry Ritter & Joel Boney (co-designers of 6809); BYTE magazine; Jan-Feb 1979. <small>[http://tlindner.macmess.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/byte_6809_articles.pdf (archive)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215123813/http://tlindner.macmess.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/byte_6809_articles.pdf |date=2010-02-15 }}</small>\n* ''MC6809 microprocessor''; Ian Powers; Microprocessors, Volume 2, Issue 3; July 1978; page 162; {{ISSN|0308-5953}}, {{doi|10.1016/0308-5953(78)90010-7}}.\n;Reference cards\n* ''MC6809 Reference Card''; Motorola; 16 pages; 1981. <small>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190714001537/http://chiclassiccomp.org/docs/content/computing/Motorola/A13262-16_MC6809MicroprocessorReferenceCard_0291.pdf (archive)]</small>\n* ''6809/6309 Reference Card''; Chris Lomont; 10 pages; 2007. <small>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180329043820/http://www.lomont.org/Software/Misc/CoCo/Lomont_6809.pdf (archive)]</small>\n\n==External links==\n;Simulators / Emulators\n* [http://atjs.great-site.net/mc6809/ 6809 Emulation Page] &ndash; collection of 6809 instructions, emulators, tools, debuggers, disassemblers, assemblers\n* [http://www.swtpcemu.com 6809 Emulator based on the SWTPC 6809 system]\n;Boards\n* [http://searle.x10host.com/6809/Simple6809.html Grant's 6-chip 6809 computer]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20220430063943/http://www.kswichit.com/6809/6809.htm 6809 microprocessor training board]\n;FPGA\n* [https://opencores.org/projects/system09 System09 6809 CPU core - VHDL source code] - OpenCores - [http://members.optushome.com.au/jekent/system09/index.html project website]\n\n{{Motorola processors}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Motorola microprocessors]]\n[[Category:8-bit microprocessors]]","_bytes":35566,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2023-10-28T02:02:23Z"},"title":"Motorola 6809","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}
