They were the eighth Olympics to be hosted by the United States, and the most recent to be held in the country (Los Angeles will host the future [[2028 Summer Olympics]]). The 2002 Winter Olympics and [[2002 Paralympic Winter Games|Paralympics]] were both organized by the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake Organizing Committee]] (SLOC), the first time that both events were organized by a single committee.<ref name=\"SLOC_Official_Report_p35\">{{cite book|last=Salt Lake Organizing Committee|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf|title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games|year=2002|isbn=978-0-9717961-0-2|page=35|access-date=October 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008034211/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf|archive-date=October 8, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Games featured 2,399 athletes from 78 nations, participating in 78 events in 15 disciplines. Norway topped the medal table, with 13 gold and 25 medals overall, while Germany finished with the most total medals, winning 36 (with 12 of them gold). The hosting United States was third by gold medals and second by overall medals, with 10 and 34 respectively. Australia notably became the first [[Southern Hemisphere]] country to ever win gold medals at the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe Games finished with a budgetary surplus of US$40 million; the surplus was used to fund the formation of the Utah Athletic Foundation—which has continued to maintain the facilities built for these Olympics. The venues have continued to be used for national and international winter sports events after the Olympics, while the [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]] has backed the possibility of Salt Lake City bidding for a future Winter Olympics.\n\n==Host city selection==\n{{Main|Bids for the 2002 Winter Olympics}}\nSalt Lake City was chosen over Québec City, Canada; Sion, Switzerland; and Östersund, Sweden, on June 16, 1995, at the 104th [[IOC Session]] in [[Budapest]], Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html |title=IOC Vote History |access-date=June 10, 2008 |archive-date=May 25, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525070757/http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Salt Lake City had previously come in second during the bids for the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], awarded to [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]], Japan, and had offered to be the provisional host of the [[1976 Winter Olympics]] when the original host, [[Denver, Colorado]], withdrew. The 1976 Winter Olympics were ultimately awarded to [[Innsbruck]], Austria.\n\nThere was a [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|scandal]] involving allegations of bribery used to win the rights to the Games. Prior to its successful bid, Salt Lake City had attempted four times to secure the games, failing each time. In 1998, members of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) were accused of taking gifts from the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake Organizing Committee]] (SLOC) during the bidding process. The allegations resulted in the expulsion of several IOC members and the adoption of new IOC rules. Although nothing strictly illegal had been done, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was morally dubious.

The university was also asked to expand [[Rice Eccles Stadium]] to accommodate 50,000 people up from 32,000. The university would then be refunded almost $59&nbsp;million and be given an extra $40&nbsp;million for its maintenance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/09/realestate/the-2002-olympics-are-transforming-salt-lake-city.html |title=The 2002 Olympics Are Transforming Salt Lake City |work=The New York Times |last=Kopytoff |first=Verne |date=November 9, 1997 |access-date=February 19, 2022}}</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: Rice Eccles Stadium Areial View.jpg|thumb| RES is also home to the University of Utah football team.]] -->\n\nThe 2002 Olympic Games also benefited the university economically since the [[Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Cauldron Park]] was elevated by the renovations that took place. Ice rinks were very scarce in Utah, but they became plentiful and offered several entertainment and training opportunities for hockey players and figure skaters due to the Olympic Games. The Cauldron Park located at the University of Utah which was built with $6.5&nbsp;million in profits and had the following features: a visitors' center which had a theater that showed a thrilling movie about the Olympic Games of 2002 and a \"park\" which had a dazzling pool and a V-shaped stone wall with the names of all the medalists of the 2002 Olympic Games. Besides, the park had 17 plates that hung on the stadium's fence celebrating the highlights of each day of the Olympics. All these features acted as tourist attraction that boosted the economic development of the university. In addition, it is indicated that the approximate value of media exposure through print during the Games was equated to $22.9&nbsp;million. Mainly, this was a huge economic benefit to the university as more and more people got to know about the educational establishment, and this also boosted enrollment and future development.\n\n===Immigration===\nHolger Preuss in his book ''The Economics of Staging the Olympics: A Comparison of the Games 1972–2008'' argues that \"The export of the 'Olympic Games' service results in an inflow of funds to the host city, causing additional production which, in its turn, leads to employment and income effects.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQzccu2Qw-oC&q=%22inflow+of+funds%22 |title=The Economics of Staging the Olympics: A Comparison of the Games 1972–2008 |isbn=978-1-8-4376-893-7 |last=Preuss |first=Holger |year=2004 |publisher=Edward Elgar |page=36}}</ref> According to the study \"2002 Olympic Winter Games, Economic, Demographic and Fiscal Impacts\", the estimated creation of new job years of employment was 35,424, and additional earnings of $1,544,203,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digitallibrary.utah.gov/awweb/awarchive?type=file&item=12491 |title=2002 Olympic Winter Games – Economic, Demographic and Fiscal Impacts |date=November 2000 |publisher=State of Utah, Governor's Office of Planning and Budget |website=digitallibrary.utah.gov |pages=4, 14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428145956/https://digitallibrary.utah.gov/awweb/awarchive?type=file&item=12491 |archive-date=April 28, 2021 |url-status=live |access-date=April 28, 2021}}</ref> It was noted that the increase of Olympic related job started in 1996 and continued until 2003. These effects can be estimated on the ground of historical relationship between job and corresponding population growth. A lot of people migrated into the future place of the [[Olympic Games]] for expanding and favorable employment opportunities that the Olympics ensured. Although residents occupied many of the higher paying jobs created by the Games, many of the vacated jobs were filled by immigrants who relocated for the better employment opportunities.\n\nBasically, the immigration rate was even larger because the employees immigrated with their families. The additional people paid diverse taxes and fees from their income, creating additional revenue on the state and local levels.\n\n===Employment===\nOlympic related jobs in Utah started in 1996 with slight job opportunities of less than 100. However, from the job measurement conducted from 1996 to 2002, steady attainment of job opportunities established and a maximum level was noted in 2001 where there were 12,500 job opportunities attained yearly, and approximately 25,070 jobs created in 2002.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0047287502041001006|title=Nonhost Community Resident Reactions to the 2002 Winter Olympics: The Spillover Impacts|first1=Cary|last1=Deccio|first2=Seyhmus|last2=Baloglu|date=August 1, 2002|journal=Journal of Travel Research|volume=41|issue=1|pages=46–56|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0047287502041001006|s2cid=154897887}}</ref> Therefore, from 1996 to 2002 the sum of employment equated to 35,000 jobs which lasted a year. February 2002 is when the highest employment opportunities were created compared to other years. There were around 25,070 job opportunities created compared to 35,000 created from 1996 to 2001.\n\nIt is difficult to quantify the impact of the 2002 Olympics on the [[unemployment rates]] in Utah, due mostly to the effect of the [[early 2000s recession]]. In 1996, the unemployment rate in Utah was approximately 3.4%, while the U.S. national average was 5.4% and by the end of 2001, the unemployment rate in Utah was around 4.8%, while the national average had risen to 5.7%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov |title=Databases, Tables & Calculators by Subject |publisher=Data.bls.gov |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2022}}</ref> There was a high percentage of visitors to the Games, which raised the number of tourists whose consumption and demand prompted the establishment of job opportunities to meet the demands.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pace |first=Levi |date=2006-07-25 |title=Economic Impact of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games |url=https://gardner.utah.edu/_documents/publications/econ-dev/olympics-econ-impact.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013004057/https://gardner.utah.edu/_documents/publications/econ-dev/olympics-econ-impact.pdf |archive-date=2017-10-13 |access-date=2022-07-23 |website=University of Utah Center for Public Policy and Administration}}</ref>\n\n===Proposed hosting of a future Winter Olympics===\nIn 2017, an exploratory committee was formed to consider a Salt Lake City bid for a future Winter Olympics.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kamrani|first1=Christopher|last2=Gorrell|first2=Mike|date=October 16, 2017|title=Utah takes big step toward bidding for 2026 or 2030 Winter Olympics|work=Salt Lake Tribune website|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sports/2017/10/16/utah-forms-exploratory-committee-for-2026-or-2030-winter-games/|access-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref> In December 2018, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC, now the [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]] [USOPC]) named Salt Lake City as its preferred candidate to bid for a future Winter Olympics, citing that its experience and existing venues could be leveraged.<ref>{{cite news|date=December 2018|title=Salt Lake City gets go-ahead to bid for Winter Olympics|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-winter-olympics-20181214-story.html|access-date=December 14, 2018}}</ref> In February 2022, amid the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] and the 20th anniversary of the Games in Salt Lake City, the USOPC stated that it was \"already in dialogue with the IOC, not yet for a specific year but as part of their evolving process\", and acknowledged that there was \"very high excitement and support from the local population.\"<ref>{{Cite web|date=February 10, 2022|title=Officials to meet next week to discuss 2030 Winter Olympic Bid in Salt Lake City|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1119076/salt-lake-olympic-bid|access-date=February 15, 2022|website=Inside the Games}}</ref>\n\n==Concerns and controversies==\n===Disqualifications for doping===\n{{see|Doping at the Olympic Games#2002 Salt Lake City}}\nThe 2002 Winter Olympics were the first Winter Olympics held after the formation of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]], resulting in the first instances of athletes being disqualified for failing drug testing.<ref>{{cite news |title=Expect illegal drugs at 2012 Olympics |author=Bob Weiner & Caitlin Harrison |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/opinion/50948868-82/drug-games-olympics-athletes.html.csp |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=December 29, 2010 |access-date=January 7, 2011}}</ref> Athletes in [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] were disqualified for various reasons, including [[doping (sport)|doping]] by two Russians and one Spaniard, leading Russia to file protests and threaten to withdraw from the competition.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/22/sports/olympics-protests-russians-threaten-to-pull-out-of-games.html |title=OLYMPICS: PROTESTS; Russians Threaten To Pull Out Of Games |first=Michael |last=Janofsky |date=February 22, 2002 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n===Pairs figure skating judging controversy===\n{{Main|2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal}}\nA major scandal emerged during the [[Figure skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics|pairs figure skating competition]]; the Canadian pair of [[Jamie Salé]] and [[David Pelletier]] narrowly lost to the Russian pair of [[Elena Berezhnaya]] and [[Anton Sikharulidze]], despite the Canadians being deemed the favorites to win after their free skate program. The French judge [[Marie-Reine Le Gougne]] alleged that the head of the [[French Federation of Ice Sports]], [[Didier Gailhaguet]], had pressured her to judge the competition in favor of Russia regardless of performance. Amid criticisms of the incident by both Canadian and American media outlets, and suspicions that this was part of a [[vote swapping]] scheme with Russia to benefit the French ice dance team, the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) voted to suspend Le Gougne for failing to immediately inform officials of Gailhaguet's actions. They also recommended to the IOC that the gold medal be jointly awarded to both pairs. An IOC panel voted in favor of the motion, resulting in both Salé and Pelletier, as well as Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, being jointly awarded gold medals.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Swift|first=E.

Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32–33</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under {{cvt|115|°C|°F}}. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76°.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30–32</ref>\n\nAccurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km|sp=us}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25–26</ref>\n\nThe mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum for display.<ref name=spare/>\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10'']]\n\n''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury.

To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of {{cvt|-40|°C|°F}}; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight.

Immediately afterward, the star-tracker locked onto a bright flake of paint which had come off the spacecraft and lost tracking on the guide star [[Canopus]]. An automated safety protocol recovered Canopus, but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission. The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems. Periodic problems with the high-gain antenna also occurred during the cruise. On 8 January 1974, a malfunction thought to be caused by a short-circuited diode occurred in the power subsystem.<ref name=\"Paul\"/> As a result, the main booster regulator and inverter failed, leaving the spacecraft dependent on the redundant regulator.

Engineers initially feared that the star-tracker could mistake the much brighter Venus for Canopus, repeating the mishaps with flaking paint. However, the star-tracker did not malfunction. Earth occultation occurred between 17:07 and 17:11 UTC, during which the spacecraft transmitted X-band radio waves through Venus' atmosphere, gathering data on cloud structure and temperature.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 61–64</ref><ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 61–63</ref> Although Venus's cloud cover is nearly featureless in visible light, it was discovered that extensive cloud detail could be seen through Mariner's ultraviolet camera filters.

It is a derivative of the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60 Black Hawk]] and incorporates the US Air Force [[PAVE]] electronic systems program. The HH-60/MH-60 is a member of the [[Sikorsky S-70]] family.\n\nThe MH-60G Pave Hawk's primary mission is insertion and recovery of [[special operations]] personnel, while the HH-60G Pave Hawk's core mission is recovery of personnel under hostile conditions, including [[combat search and rescue]]. Both versions conduct day or night operations into hostile environments. Because of its versatility, the HH-60G may also perform peacetime operations such as civil search and rescue, emergency [[medical evacuation|aeromedical evacuation]] (MEDEVAC), disaster relief, international aid and counter-drug activities.\n\nThe USAF HH/MH-60G are in the process of being replaced by the new ''HH-60W Jolly Green II''.\n\n==Design and development==\nIn 1981, the U.S. Air Force chose the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60A Black Hawk]] to replace its [[Sikorsky S-61R|HH-3E Jolly Green Giant]] helicopters. After acquiring some UH-60s, the Air Force began upgrading each with an air refueling probe and additional fuel tanks in the cabin. The machine guns were changed from 7.62&nbsp;mm (0.308&nbsp;in) [[M60 machine gun|M60s]] to .50&nbsp;caliber (12.7&nbsp;mm) [[M2 Browning machine gun#XM213/M213, XM218, GAU-15/A, GAU-16/A, and GAU-18/A|XM218s]]. These helicopters were referred to as \"Credible Hawks\" and entered service in 1987.<ref name=\"Eden_H-60\">Eden, Paul. \"Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk/Seahawk\", ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''. Amber Books, 2004. {{ISBN|1-904687-84-9}}.</ref>\n\nAfterwards, the Credible Hawks and new UH-60As were upgraded and designated MH-60G Pave Hawk. These upgrades were to be done in a two-step process. However, funding allowed only 16 Credible Hawks to receive the second step equipment. These helicopters were allocated to special operations use. The remaining 82 Credible Hawks received the first step upgrade equipment and were used for combat search and rescue. In 1991, these search and rescue Pave Hawks were redesignated HH-60G.<ref name=\"Eden_H-60\"/><ref name=\"Bishop_UH-60\">Bishop, Chris. ''Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk''.

The term [[PAVE]] stands for Precision Avionics Vectoring Equipment.\n\n[[File:Sikorsky HH60.jpg|thumb|left|An HH-60G at the 2007 [[Paris Air Show]] ]]\nAll HH-60Gs have an automatic flight control system, [[night vision goggles]] lighting and [[forward looking infrared]] system that greatly enhances night low-level operations. Additionally, some Pave Hawks have color weather [[radar]] and an engine/rotor blade anti-ice system that gives the HH-60G an all-weather capability. Pave Hawk mission equipment includes a retractable [[in-flight refueling]] probe, internal auxiliary fuel tanks, two crew-served (or pilot-controlled) 7.62&nbsp;mm miniguns or .50-caliber machine guns and an 8,000 pound (3,600&nbsp;kg) capacity cargo hook. To improve air transportability and shipboard operations, all HH-60Gs have folding rotor blades.\n\nPave Hawk combat enhancements include a radar warning receiver, infrared jammer and a [[flare]]/[[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]] [[countermeasure]] dispensing system. HH-60G rescue equipment includes a hoist capable of lifting a 600-pound (270&nbsp;kg) load from a hover height of 200 feet (60 m), and a personnel locating system.

An options analysis was completed in 2002 and funding for 141 aircraft under the \"personnel recovery vehicle\" program began in 2004.  In 2005, it was renamed ''CSAR-X'', meaning combat search and rescue.

Some of the differences were:\n\n* The MOVE from SR instruction is now privileged (it may only be executed in supervisor mode). This means that the 68010 meets [[Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements]]. Because the 68000 offers an unprivileged MOVE from SR, it does not meet them.\n* The MOVE from CCR instruction was added to partially compensate for the removal of the user-mode MOVE from SR.\n* It can recover from bus faults, and re-run the last instruction, allowing it to implement [[virtual memory]].\n* The exception stack frame is different.\n* It introduced a 22-bit Vector Base Register (VBR) that holds A[31:10] of the 1 KiB-aligned base address for the [[Exception handling|exception]] vector table. The 68000 vector table was always based at address zero.\n* \"Loop mode\" which accelerates loops consisting of only two instructions, such as a MOVE and a DBRA. The two-instruction mini-loop opcodes are prefetched and held in the 6-byte instruction cache while subsequent memory read/write cycles are only needed for the data operands for the duration of the loop. It provided for performance improvements averaging 50%, as a result of the elimination of instruction opcodes fetching during the loop.\n\nIn practice, the overall speed gain over a 68000 at the same frequency is less than 10%.\n\n[[Image:MC68451 p1160081.jpg|thumb|upright|Motorola 68451 MMU]]\nThe 68010 could be used with the [[Motorola 68451|68451]] [[Memory management unit|MMU]]. However, aspects of its design, such as its 1 [[Clock signal|clock]] [[computer storage|memory]] access penalty, made this configuration unpopular. Some vendors used their own MMU designs, such as [[Sun Microsystems]] in their [[Sun-2]] workstation and [[Convergent Technologies]] in the [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] [[AT&T UNIX PC|UNIX PC/3B1]].\n\n== Usage ==\nThe 68010 was never as popular as the 68000. However, due to the 68010's small speed boost over the 68000 and its support for virtual memory, it can be found in a number of smaller [[Unix]] systems, both with the 68451 MMU (for example in the [[Torch Triple X]]), and with a custom MMU (such as the [[Sun-2]] [[Workstation]], [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] [[AT&T UNIX PC|UNIX PC/3B1]], [[Convergent Technologies]] MiniFrame, [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] Tower XP, [[Apollo Computer]]'s [[Apollo/Domain|DN300 and DN320]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/apollo/002685-07_Technical_Publications_Overview_Jun87.pdf|title=Apollo Computer Technical Publications Overview|date=June 1987|publisher=Apollo Computer|access-date=2022-10-13}}</ref> and [[HP 9000]] Model 310) and various research machines. Most other vendors (such as Apple Computer) stayed with the 68000 until the [[Motorola 68020|68020]] was introduced. \n\n[[Atari Games]] used the 68010 in some of their arcade boards such as the [[Atari System|Atari System 1]]. Some owners of [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] computers and [[Sega Genesis]] game consoles replaced their system's 68000 CPU with a 68010 to gain a small speed boost.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.memphisamigagroup.net/diskmags/198803/68010-kit/MC68010.ins| title =  AMIGA (tm) TECHNICAL NOTE Upgrading an AMIGA A1000 with a Motorola MC68010L8| first = Thad| last = Floryan}}</ref>\n\n==Motorola 68012==\n[[File:Motorola MC68012 0988.jpg|upright|thumb|Motorola 68012]]\n[[File:Motorola MC68012 die.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Die (integrated circuit)|Die]] of Motorola 68012]]\nThe '''Motorola MC68012''' processor is a 16/32-bit [[microprocessor]] from the early 1980s.

All other features of the MC68010 were preserved.\n\nThe expansion of the memory space caused an issue for any programs that used the high byte of an address to store data, a programming trick that was successful with those processors that only have a 24-bit address bus (68000 and 68010).

From [[1971 Daytona 500|1971]] to [[2011 Daytona 500|2011]], and again since [[2018 Daytona 500|2018]], the event has been as associated with [[Washington's Birthday|Presidents Day]] weekend, taking place on the Sunday before the third Monday in February. On eight occasions, the race has been run on [[Valentine's Day]].\n\nSince 1997, the winner of the Daytona 500 has been presented with the [[Harley J.

A {{convert|500|mi|km|0|adj=on}} [[stock car racing|stock car race]] was held at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in [[1959 Daytona 500|1959]]. It was the second 500-mile NASCAR race, following the annual [[Bojangles' Southern 500|Southern 500]], and has been held every year since. By [[1961 Daytona 500|1961]], it began to be referred to as the '''Daytona 500''',<ref name=\"programs\">1959, 1960, and 1961 Daytona 500 Programs</ref> by which it is still commonly known.\n\nDaytona International Speedway is {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}} long and a 500-mile race<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.autoballa.com/2014/07/157289/rise-and-fall-nascar-indy | title=The Rise And Fall Of NASCAR At Indy | date=Jul 24, 2014 | access-date=16 August 2014 | archive-date=19 August 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082417/http://www.autoballa.com/2014/07/157289/rise-and-fall-nascar-indy | url-status=dead }}</ref> requires 200 laps to complete. However, the race was considered official after halfway (100 laps/250 miles) had been completed from 1959 to 2016. From 2017 to 2019, the race was considered official after the conclusion of Stage 2 (120 laps/300 miles) when stage-racing was introduced. In 2020, they revised the rule in which a race is considered official at either halfway or the conclusion of Stage 2 (whichever comes first, in this case halfway). The race has been shortened four times due to rain (in [[1965 Daytona 500|1965]], [[1966 Daytona 500|1966]], [[2003 Daytona 500|2003]], and [[2009 Daytona 500|2009]]) and once in response to the energy crisis of [[1974 Daytona 500|1974]]. Since the adaptation of the [[green–white–checker finish|green–white–checkered finish]] rule in 2004, the race has gone past 500 miles on ten occasions ([[2005 Daytona 500|2005]], [[2006 Daytona 500|2006]], [[2007 Daytona 500|2007]], [[2010 Daytona 500|2010]], [[2011 Daytona 500|2011]], [[2012 Daytona 500|2012]], [[2015 Daytona 500|2015]], [[2018 Daytona 500|2018]], [[2019 Daytona 500|2019]], [[2020 Daytona 500|2020]] and 2023). It took two attempts to finish the race in 2010, 2011, and 2020. The 2023 running is the longest Daytona 500 contested, lasting 212 laps/530 miles.\n\n==History highlights==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\n{{Main|Daytona 500 history}}\n* '''[[1959 Daytona 500|1959]]''': [[Lee Petty]], patriarch of the racing family, won the inaugural Daytona 500 on February 22, 1959, defeating [[Johnny Beauchamp]].\n* '''[[1960 Daytona 500|1960]]''': [[Junior Johnson]] made use of the [[drafting (aerodynamics)|draft]], then a little-understood phenomenon, to win while running a slower, year-old car in a field of 68 cars, the most in the history of the Daytona 500.\n* '''[[1965 Daytona 500|1965]]''': The first rain-shortened Daytona 500.

With 5 laps to go, Cale made a successful slingshot pass on the third turn to take the lead from LeeRoy and never looked back as he won his first Daytona 500 by 1.3 seconds.\n* '''[[1969 Daytona 500|1969]]''' : Having learned from the previous year, LeeRoy Yarbrough would use the same slingshot treatment out of turn 3 on [[Charlie Glotzbach]], to score the victory on the final lap.\n* '''[[1971 Daytona 500|1971]]''': Richard Petty becomes the first three-time winner, including the [[1964 Daytona 500|1964]] and [[1966 Daytona 500|1966 races]]. Through 2015, only 5 drivers have won 3 or more Daytona 500s.\n* '''[[1972 Daytona 500|1972]]''':  A. J. Foyt cruised into the lead on lap 80 and stayed there through the 200 lap race, lapping the entire field. Foyt beat second-place Charlie Glotzbach by nearly two laps, with Jim Vandiver finishing 6 laps down in third.\n* '''[[1973 Daytona 500|1973]]''': Richard Petty becomes the first four-time winner, including the [[1964 Daytona 500|1964]], [[1966 Daytona 500|1966]] and [[1971 Daytona 500|1971 races]] . Through 2015, only Petty (7 total) and Cale Yarborough have won at least 4 Daytona 500s.\n* '''[[1974 Daytona 500|1974]]''': During the start of the 1974 NASCAR season, many races had their distance cut ten percent in response to the [[1973 oil crisis]]. As a result, the 1974 Daytona 500 was shortened to 180 laps (450 miles), as symbolically, the race \"started\" on lap 21.  Richard Petty became the first of only 4 drivers (as of 2021) to win consecutive Daytona 500s, while also setting a mark of 5 total wins.<!--not clear as written if it's 5 or 7 that was unequalled; mention it at 7.-->\n* '''[[1976 Daytona 500|1976]]''': In the 1976 race, Richard Petty was leading on the last lap when he was passed on the backstretch by David Pearson. Petty tried to turn under Pearson coming off the final corner but didn't clear Pearson. The contact caused the drivers to spin into the grass in the infield just short of the finish line. Petty's car didn't start, but Pearson was able to keep his car running and limp over the finish line for the win. Many fans consider this finish to be the greatest in the history of NASCAR.\n* '''[[1979 Daytona 500|1979]]''': The 1979 race was the first Daytona 500 to be broadcast live on national television,<ref name=nascar.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2003/kyn/history/daytona/01/23/daytona_1979/ |title=1979: Petty winds up in 'fist' place |access-date=June 9, 2007 |author=Mark Aumann |date=January 23, 2003 |publisher=Turner Sports Interactive |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061914/http://www.nascar.com/2003/kyn/history/daytona/01/23/daytona_1979/ |archive-date=May 25, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/1979-Daytona-500/dp/B000E4IED2 |title=1979 Daytona 500 |website=Amazon |access-date=June 9, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070716050023/http://www.amazon.com/1979-Daytona-500/dp/B000E4IED2| archive-date= 16 July 2007 | url-status= dead}}</ref> airing on [[CBS Sports|CBS]], whose audience was increased in much of the Eastern and Midwestern USA due to a blizzard. (The [[Indianapolis 500]] was only broadcast on tape delay that evening in this era; most races were broadcast only through the final quarter to half of the race, as was the procedure for ABC's Championship Auto Racing broadcasts; with the new CBS contract, the network and NASCAR agreed to a full live broadcast.) That telecast introduced in-car and low-level track-side cameras, which has now become standard in all sorts of automotive racing broadcasts. A final lap crash and subsequent fight between leaders Cale Yarborough and [[Donnie Allison]] (along with Donnie's brother [[Bobby Allison|Bobby]]) brought national (if unwelcome) publicity to NASCAR, with the added emphasis of a snowstorm that bogged down much of the northeastern part of the United States. Donnie Allison was leading the race on the final lap with Yarborough drafting him tightly. As Yarborough attempted a slingshot pass at the end of the backstretch, Allison attempted to block him. Yarborough refused to give ground and as he pulled alongside Allison, his left side tires left the pavement and went into the wet and muddy infield grass. Yarborough lost control of his car and contacted Allison's car halfway down the backstretch. As both drivers tried to regain control, their cars made contact several more times before finally locking together and crashing into the outside wall in turn three. After the cars settled in the grass, Donnie Allison and Yarborough began to argue. After they had talked it out, Bobby Allison, who was lapped at that point, pulled over, began defending his brother, and a fight broke out. Richard Petty, who was over half a lap behind at the time, went on to win; with the brawl in the infield, the television audience scarcely noticed. The story was the talk of the water cooler the next day, even making the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' Sports section.\n* '''[[1980 Daytona 500|1980]]''': [[Buddy Baker]] won the fastest Daytona 500 in history before the introduction of mandatory stage cautions in 2017, at 177.602&nbsp;mph (285.809&nbsp;km/h).\n* '''[[1981 Daytona 500|1981]]''': Richard Petty becomes the first seven-time winner, three wins more than the second-highest multiple winner, Cale Yarborough. With wins in [[1964 Daytona 500|1964]], [[1966 Daytona 500|1966]], [[1971 Daytona 500|1971]], [[1973 Daytona 500|1973]], [[1974 Daytona 500|1974]], and [[1979 Daytona 500|1979]],  Petty is the only driver to win in three different decades.\n* '''[[1982 Daytona 500|1982]]''': The Daytona 500 becomes the opening race in the NASCAR season, a position held since. Bobby Allison wins his second Daytona 500 but many people consider this a controversial win because on lap 3 Bobby Allison's rear bumper broke away from the car (later it was discovered that it was welded on purpose by a wire welder) and caused a pileup further behind the leaders. Without a rear bumper, Allison's car gained an aerodynamic advantage and won the race by just over twenty-two seconds.\n* '''[[1983 Daytona 500|1983]]''': Cale Yarborough was the first driver to run a qualifying lap over {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in his [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]; only to crash out during the second qualifying lap. Yarborough raced in a backup [[Pontiac LeMans]] displayed at a nearby [[Hardee's]] (Yarborough's sponsor) and took the backup car to his 3rd Daytona 500 victory. This would also be the final time a driver won a Daytona 500 in a Pontiac.\n* '''[[1984 Daytona 500|1984]]''': Cale Yarborough completed a lap of  {{convert|201.848|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, officially breaking the {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} barrier at Daytona. He joined Richard Petty as the only drivers to win the race in consecutive years and to win the race four times overall.\n* '''[[1985 Daytona 500|1985]]''': [[Bill Elliott]] dominated the race, and by lap 140, was close to lapping the entire field. During a pit stop, NASCAR officials held him in the pit area in order to repair a supposed broken headlight assembly. The two-minute pit stop dropped him to third, barely clinging to the lead lap. Elliott made up the deficit and survived a late-race caution and a final lap restart to win his first Daytona 500. Elliott would go on to win the first [[Grand Slam (NASCAR)|Winston Million]].\n* '''[[1986 Daytona 500|1986]]''': The race that came down to a two-car duel between [[Dale Earnhardt]] and [[Geoff Bodine]]. With 3 laps to go, Earnhardt was forced to make a pit stop for a \"splash 'n go\". However, as Earnhardt left the pits, he burned a piston, allowing Bodine to cruise to victory.\n* '''[[1987 Daytona 500|1987]]''': Winner Bill Elliott qualified for the pole position at an all-time Daytona record of 210.364&nbsp;mph (338.532&nbsp;km/h). Bill Elliott dominated much of the race, leading 104 of the 200 laps. During two different points in the race, he pulled away from the other leaders and was all by himself on the track, leading the first 35 laps, 29 in a row at another point, and the last three.\n* '''[[1988 Daytona 500|1988]]''': [[Restrictor plate]]s were mandated to reduce dangerously high speeds at Daytona. This race was remembered for two things. First, Richard Petty's rollover crash in the tri-oval on lap 106, initiated when he was tagged from behind by Phil Barkdoll. Petty rolled over about eight times and was then hit by Brett Bodine. The wreck also collected 1972 race winner A. J. Foyt, Eddie Bierschwale, and Alan Kulwicki. all of the drivers, including Petty, walked away. Second, [[Bobby Allison]] and his son [[Davey Allison|Davey]] finished one-two and celebrated together in Victory Lane, making Bobby Allison the oldest driver to win the Daytona 500.\n* '''[[1989 Daytona 500|1989]]''': [[Darrell Waltrip]] stretches his final tank of fuel for 53 laps to win in his 17th try.\n* '''[[1990 Daytona 500|1990]]''': Dale Earnhardt appeared headed for certain victory until the closing laps. On lap 193, Geoff Bodine spun in the first turn, causing the third and final caution of the race. All of the leaders pitted except [[Derrike Cope]], who stayed out to gain track position. On the lap 195 restart, Earnhardt re-took the lead. On the final lap, going into turn three, he ran over a [[bell housing]] from the blown engine of [[Rick Wilson (NASCAR)|Rick Wilson]]'s car. He blew a tire, allowing the relatively unknown Cope to slip by and take his first career win in a major upset.<ref>{{cite web | title = NASCAR.com&nbsp;— The 1990 Daytona 500 – July 28, 2003 | url = http://www.nascar.com/2002/kyn/history/races/02/02/90daytona500/ | access-date = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070817224950/http://www.nascar.com/2002/kyn/history/races/02/02/90daytona500/ | archive-date = August 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n* '''[[1991 Daytona 500|1991]]''': Dale Earnhardt's Daytona 500 frustrations continued as [[Ernie Irvan]] passed Earnhardt with six laps to go to. Ultimately, Earnhardt - who was battling issues with the car temperature after striking a seagull early in the race - spun with two laps remaining and collected [[Davey Allison]] and [[Kyle Petty]]. Irvan took the win as the race ended under the caution flag. The race was dominated by complex pit stop rules, implemented to improve safety in the pit area.\n* '''[[1992 Daytona 500|1992]]''': Davey Allison dominated the second half en route to his lone Daytona 500 victory. He avoided a major wreck on lap 92 and went on to lead the final 102 laps.\n* '''[[1993 Daytona 500|1993]]''':  In a frightening wreck on lap 170, [[Rusty Wallace]] flipped over multiple times on the back straightaway. With two laps to go, [[Dale Earnhardt]] was leading Jeff Gordon and [[Dale Jarrett]]. Jarrett battled into the lead with one lap to go. It was the fourth time Earnhardt had been leading the Daytona 500 with less than ten laps to go but failed to win.\n* '''[[1994 Daytona 500|1994]]''': [[Sterling Marlin]] gambled on fuel and was able to complete the final 59 laps without stopping, to win his first career Cup victory.

[[Kurt Busch]] won as Elliott, [[Martin Truex Jr.]], and [[Kyle Larson]] all ran out of fuel in the last four laps.\n* '''[[2018 Daytona 500|2018]]''': 20 years after [[Dale Earnhardt Sr.]] earned his [[1998 Daytona 500|iconic victory]] at Daytona, [[Austin Dillon]] brought Richard Childress's #3 Chevrolet back to Victory Lane. Dillon, Childress's grandson, who was photographed next to Earnhardt as a child after the earlier win, led only the final lap, bumping leader [[Aric Almirola]] out of the way, sending the latter's Ford into the wall. Also of note, rookie [[Darrell Wallace Jr.]] finished in the runner-up spot, barely edging out 2016 winner [[Denny Hamlin]], the highest finish for an African-American driver in the event's history. It was also the final NASCAR race for [[Danica Patrick]], who was collected in a multi-car wreck near the end of the second stage that also ended the days of [[Chase Elliott]], [[Brad Keselowski]], [[Kevin Harvick]], among others. This race was also the fastest Daytona 500 in the stages era.\n* '''[[2019 Daytona 500|2019]]''': The last race to use traditional restrictor plates in NASCAR since 1988. [[William Byron (racing driver)|William Byron]] started on the pole alongside [[Alex Bowman]], making it the youngest front-row starters in Daytona 500 history. [[Kurt Busch]] was caught up in an early wreck after contact with [[Ricky Stenhouse Jr.]], collecting [[Jamie McMurray]], [[Austin Dillon]], and [[Bubba Wallace]]. [[Kyle Busch]] would win stage 1 and [[Ryan Blaney]] would win stage 2. [[Matt DiBenedetto]], driving for [[Leavine Family Racing]], would lead a race-high of 49 laps until he was caught up in \"[[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]]\" with nine laps to go after contact with [[Paul Menard]] going into turn 3, collecting 18 cars in all. Two more wrecks occurring in the final 5 laps forced the race into overtime. [[Denny Hamlin]] escaped through all the late crashes and would go on to win his second Daytona 500 race in his career.

On Lap 63, an eight-car wreck caused by Brad Keselowski, who now was a part owner at [[RFK Racing]], would lead to rookie [[Harrison Burton]] flipping his car. Keselowski later turned Stenhouse Jr. with six laps to go in the race. [[Austin Cindric]] would hold off [[Bubba Wallace]] at the finish line to win the 500 in only his 8th Cup start, while also becoming the second youngest driver to win (behind Trevor Bayne).\n\n==Qualifying procedure==\n{{Main|Bluegreen Vacations Duel}}\nThe qualifying procedure is unique for the Daytona 500. Some teams must race their way into the Daytona 500 field. The first row is set by a timed round of qualifying. Prior to 2021, the session was held one week before the race (prior to 2003, this was two rounds; prior to 2001, it was three) but the session is now held on the Wednesday evening leading up to the race. The remainder of the field is set on the Thursday before the race by two separate qualifying races (these were {{convert|100|mi|km}} from 1959 to 1967; {{convert|125|mi|km}} from 1969 to 2004; and {{convert|150|mi|km}} with a two-lap overtime, if necessary, beginning in 2005 (these races were not held in 1968 due to rain)). The top two drivers from the qualifying races who were not in the top 35 in owner points were given spots on the field, and the rest of the field was set by the finishing order of the duels, with guaranteed spots to those in the top 35. The remaining spots, 40 to 43, were filled by top qualifying times of those not already in the field from the qualifying race. If there was a previous NASCAR champion without a spot, he would get one of those four spots, otherwise, the fourth-fastest car was added to the field.\n\nPrior to 2005 – and beginning again in 2013 – after the top two cars were set, the top fourteen cars in the qualifying races advance to the field, and then between six (1998–2003), eight (1995–97, 2004) or 10 (until 1994) fastest cars which do not advance from the qualifying race are added, then cars in the top 35 in owner points not locked into the race, and then the driver with the championship provisional, except for 1985 when no such car was eligible for a provisional starting spot, the only time that happened in the Daytona 500 from when the provisional was added in 1976 through 2004.\n\n==Television==\n{{See also|List of Daytona 500 broadcasters}}\n\nThe Daytona 500 was the first {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} auto race to be televised live flag-to-flag on network television when [[CBS]] aired it in 1979, continuing to air until 2000.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2006, the race alternated between [[Fox NASCAR|FOX]] and [[NASCAR on NBC|NBC]] under the terms of a six–year, $2.48 billion NASCAR television contract, with FOX broadcasting the Daytona 500 in odd-numbered years (2001, 2003, 2005) and the [[Coke Zero 400|Pepsi 400]] in even-numbered years (2002, 2004, 2006) and NBC broadcasting the opposite race in that year.\n\nIn 2005, a new television contract was signed, which made FOX the sole broadcaster of the Daytona 500 for eight years, from 2007 to 2014. In 2013, 10 more years were added to the contract, giving FOX every Daytona 500 from 2015 to 2024 as well, for a total of at least 20 Daytona 500s in a row.\nThe installation of the [[Night game#Motorsports|lighting system]] at Daytona International Speedway in 1998, as well as the implementations of the television packages in 2001 and 2007 respectively, have resulted in the race starting and ending much later than it did in the race's early years. The race started at 12:15&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] from 1979 until 2000. The start time was moved to 1:00&nbsp;p.m [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] from 2001 to 2004, 2:30&nbsp;p.m. in 2005 and 2006, and 3:30&nbsp;p.m. from 2007 to 2009, all for the convenience of west coast viewers. The 2005 race ended at sunset for the first time in its history, and the 2006 race ended well after sunset.\n\nEvery Daytona 500 between 2006 and 2010, as well as the 2012 and 2014 races, ended under the lights. The changing track conditions caused by the onset of darkness in the closing laps in these years forced the crew chiefs to predict the critical car setup adjustments needed for their final two pit stops. The 2007 race was the first Daytona 500 to go into prime-time, ending at 7:07&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time. In 2010, the race moved back to a 1:00&nbsp;p.m. start time, which should have resulted in it ending in daylight; however, two red flags caused by track surface issues led to long delays that pushed the race to 7:34&nbsp;p.m. EST, pushing the race into prime-time for the second time. The 2012 race was also scheduled to start at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. EST on Sunday, February 26, but heavy rain in the area caused the race to be postponed to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. EST on Monday, February 27, making it the first Daytona 500 to be postponed to a Monday, as well as the first (and only) Daytona 500 to be run as a night race. Due to a two–hour red flag period after a jet dryer fire on the track with 40 laps remaining, the race did not end until about 12:40&nbsp;a.m. on Tuesday, February 28. The 2013 race marked a return to the race's past tradition of ending in the late afternoon, as it ended at about 4:40&nbsp;p.m., the race's earliest ending time since 2004. Although the 2014 race started around 1:30&nbsp;p.m. EST, heavy rain and a [[tornado warning]] red–flagged the race after 38 laps and it was delayed for a record six hours and 22 minutes; the race finished the entire 500–mile distance around after 11:00&nbsp;p.m. the same day, which effectively competed with the time-delayed East Coast broadcast of [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]]'s coverage of the [[2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony]], scheduled between 7:00 and 10:30&nbsp;p.m. The 2015 race started on time around 1:00 &nbsp;p.m., and ended after 203 laps due to a Green–white–checkered finish.\n\nThe television ratings for the Daytona 500 have surpassed those of the larger [[Indianapolis 500]] (which has much larger physical attendance and international attendance) since 1995, even though the 1995 race was available in far fewer homes than the year before. Then-broadcaster CBS had lost well-established [[very high frequency|VHF]] (channels 2–13) affiliates in major markets as a result of the [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|Fox affiliate switches of 1994]]. As an example, new affiliates [[WDJT-TV|WDJT]] in [[Milwaukee]] and [[WANF|WGNX]] in [[Atlanta]]&nbsp;— both cities that are home to NASCAR races&nbsp;—  and [[WWJ-TV|WWJ]] in [[Detroit]], close to [[Michigan International Speedway]], were on the [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] band (channels 14–69), meaning that they had a significantly reduced broadcast area compared to former affiliates [[WITI (TV)|WITI]], [[WAGA-TV]], and [[WJBK]], respectively.  WDJT was not available in many Wisconsin markets by the time the Daytona 500 took place.\n\n==Pole position holders==\n{{Main|List of Daytona 500 pole position winners}}\n\n==List of Daytona 500 winners==\n{{Main|List of Daytona 500 winners}}\n''For NASCAR [[NASCAR Cup Series|Grand National]] winners at Daytona from 1949 to 1958, see [[Daytona Beach and Road Course#NASCAR race results|Daytona Beach and Road Course]].''<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Date\n! rowspan=\"2\"|{{abbr|No.|Car number}}\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Driver\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Manufacturer\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Sponsor\n! colspan=\"2\"|Distance\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Race Time\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Average Speed<br />(mph)\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Report\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Ref\n|-\n!

Although the original Tandy 1000 comes in an IBM PC-like [[desktop case]], some models, notably the 1000 EX and 1000 HX, use [[home computer|home-computer]]-style cases with the keyboard, motherboard and disk drives in one enclosure. This high level of integration made these machines a cost-effective alternative to larger and more complex IBM PC/XT and PC/AT-type systems, which require multiple add-in cards, often purchased separately, to implement a comparable feature-set to the Tandy 1000.\n\nBeing derived from IBM's PCjr architecture, the Tandy 1000 offers several important features that most IBM PC-compatibles of the time lacks, such as the PCjr's sound generator and extended CGA-compatible graphics controller. It also offers multiple built-in I/O ports, including a [[game port]] port which was frequently a separate add-on card on non-Tandy machines.\n\nThe original line is equipped with the [[Intel 8088]] [[central processing unit|CPU]], which was later extended to faster clock speeds and also the [[Intel 8086|8086]], [[Intel 80286|80286]] and toward the end of the line with the RSX, [[Intel 80386SX|80386SX]] processors. Successors to the 1000 appended two or three letters to the name, after a space (e.g. Tandy 1000 EX and Tandy 1000 HX).  In a few instances, after these letters a slash was appended, followed by either a number or additional letters (e.g. Tandy 1000 TL/2, Tandy 1000 RL/HD).\n\n===Retirement===\nBy 1993, changes in the market made it increasingly difficult for Tandy Corporation to make a profit on its computer line. Tandy Corporation sold its computer manufacturing business to [[AST Computers]], and all Tandy computer lines were terminated. Radio Shack stores then began selling computers made by other manufacturers, such as [[IBM]]<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Radio+Shack+adds+hot+new+IBM+Aptiva+MPC+to+name-brand+computer+line.-a015914929|access-date=May 16, 2017|date=Nov 9, 1994|via=Business Wire|title=Radio Shack adds hot new IBM Aptiva MPC to name-brand computer line.|archive-date=July 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714021322/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Radio+Shack+adds+hot+new+IBM+Aptiva+MPC+to+name-brand+computer+line.-a015914929|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Compaq]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corpinfo.radioshack.com/investor/annualreports/97/ops_computers.htm |title=Radio Shack Computers - 1997 Annual Report |publisher=RadioShack.com |date=1997 |access-date=2015-02-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212025433/http://corpinfo.radioshack.com/investor/annualreports/97/ops_computers.htm |archive-date=February 12, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn an article subtitled \"Junior meets his match\", [[John J.

The original 1000 and SX has a light-pen port. Unlike most PC clones, several Tandy 1000 computers have [[MS-DOS]] built into [[read-only memory|ROM]] and can boot in a few seconds. Tandy bundled [[DeskMate]], a graphical suite of consumer-oriented applications, with various Tandy 1000 models. \n \nEarly Tandy 1000 models use [[Phoenix Technologies|Phoenix BIOS]]. Common models of the machine include the Tandy 1000, 1000 EX, 1000 HX, 1000 SX, 1000 TX, 1000 SL, 1000 RL, and 1000 TL. With the exception of the RLX and RSX, the Tandy 1000 machines are XT-class machines, which cannot support [[extended memory]] despite some models using 80286 processors. The RLX is an oddity, as it is an XT-class machine that supports 384&nbsp;KB of extended memory, and the RSX is a fully AT-class machine which can support up to 9&nbsp;MB of extended memory.\n\n=== Expansion slots ===\nWith the exception of the 1000 EX and HX, Tandy used industry standard 8-bit XT ISA slots in their desktop models, including the SX, TX, SL, and TL series, but the actual length is limited to 10.5 inches or shorter, rather than the industry standard XT length of 13 inches. While many 8-bit cards meet this length requirement, some cards such as hard cards, EMS memory cards, and multifunction cards that require the standard 13\" length do not fit in the 1000s case. The EX and HX utilize a PLUS-style connector, which is electronically identical to an 8-bit XT ISA slot, but has a 62-pin Berg connector instead of a card edge, rendering it incompatible with ISA cards without an adapter. The PLUS connector was designed for compactness in these models with built-in keyboards. The 1000 RSX features two 16-bit AT ISA slots.\n\n===Hard disk drives===\nAs hard disk drives at the time of the Tandy 1000's introduction were very expensive, Tandy 1000 systems are not usually equipped with hard drives. However, it is possible to add a hard drive to most Tandy 1000 computers. Most of the desktop-type Tandy 1000 units can accept regular 8-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]], [[Run-length limited|RLL]] and [[SCSI]] controllers like typical XT-class machines; however, care has to be taken when configuring the cards so that they do not cause conflicts with the on-board Tandy-designed peripherals.\n\nFor most Tandy 1000 models (other than the compact EX and HX) that do not come equipped with a hard drive, Tandy offered hard disk options in the form of [[hardcard]]s that are installed in one of the computer's expansion slots and consist of a controller and drive (typically a 3.5-inch MFM or RLL unit with a Western Digital controller) mounted together on a metal bracket. Their own 20 MB hard card was offered for $799, though compatible third-party units were available. Although this arrangement providses a neat physical coupling between the controller and the disk, single-sector internal transfers and dependence on the speed of the host machine to transfer data to memory means that a trial-and-error approach was still needed to set the disk [[interleaving (disk storage)|interleave]] correctly to ensure optimum transfer rates. Furthermore, as the Tandy 1000's slots are only 10.5\" long and are 8-bit only, some units do not fit and/or operate correctly unless they are certified to be Tandy-compatible.\n\nStarting with the Tandy 1000 TL/2, XT IDE controllers are integrated onto the motherboard. However, these are incompatible with common AT IDE hard drives. The TL/2, TL/3, RL and RLX all use the XT IDE interface, where the later (and significantly upgraded) RSX is the only Tandy 1000 model computer to use a standard [[Integrated Drive Electronics|AT IDE]] interface. One option for modern users of these systems is to install and use XT ISA CompactFlash adapter; this is also the most practical way to install a hard drive into a Tandy 1000 EX or HX, using an adapter cable that adapts the male PLUS-style connector to an 8-bit ISA card-edge slot.\n\n=== I/O and ports ===\nTandy 1000, SX, and TX use a proprietary 8-pin round DIN connector for the keyboard port that is compatible with the older TRS computers but not compatible with the [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM PC/AT]] or PS/2 standard. Some scan codes differ between the Tandy 1000 and IBM PC/XT and AT, resulting in software compatibility issues. The SL/TL and later use a more directly PC/XT-compatible keyboard protocol, and the 1000 RSX used a PC/AT and PS/2-compatible protocol.\n\nTandy 1000 uses a proprietary 6-pin female round connector for the joystick port that on the SX/TX i adjacent to the keyboard port in the front of the computer. As with the keyboard, it is compatible with the older TRS-80 and Tandy color computer models, but not compatible with the IBM standard 15-pin male game port. Some DOS games do not work with these joystick ports, but those that support Tandy 1000 graphics and sound work.\n\nEarly Tandy 1000 models use a non-standard card-edge parallel printer port rather than industry standard DB-25 printer port. It requires a Tandy-1000 compatible printer cable to connect to a standard printer parallel port. This was later changed to a standard DB-25 connector on the 1000 RL.\n\nTandy 1000TX and beyond use a proprietary floppy drive cable port, that also powers the floppy drive. It requires a Tandy 1000-compatible floppy drive, though it may be possible to modify a floppy drive cable to make a standard floppy drive work.\n\n=== Operating systems and environments ===\nTandy shipped PCs with their own customized version of [[MS-DOS]], which are compatible with Tandy graphics and keyboard. The most current version of MS-DOS for Tandy 1000 is DOS 3.22. Tandy 1000s came shipped with one of several varieties of [[DeskMate]], the company's own [[graphical user interface|GUI]] productivity software suite.\n\nThere may be compatibility issues with later versions of DOS such as DOS 5 and DOS 6. Until the 1000 RLX, Tandy 1000s are typically limited to 640&nbsp;KB main memory, and non-Tandy versions of DOS often reduce the memory available for applications and games. In addition, the hardware detection routine for the installer of Microsoft MS-DOS 6 can corrupt the serial EEPROM of Tandy 1000 HX machines.<ref name=\"dos60ref\">{{Cite web |title=MS-DOS 6.0 UPGRADE PACKAGE |url=ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/tandy1000/documents/dos60.txt |access-date=2023-05-30 |archive-date=2022-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220806054244/ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/tandy1000/documents/dos60.txt |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref>\n\nTandy 1000s can work with [[Windows 1.0]], [[Windows 2.0|2.0]], and [[Windows 3.0|3.0]] but not [[Windows 3.1x|3.1]], with the exception of the RLX which can run Windows 3.1 in Standard mode,<ref name=TVDogPics>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldskool.org/guides/tvdog/RLRLX.html|title = Tandy 1000RL and RLX Pictures}}</ref> and the RSX which fully supports Windows 3.1 in 386 Enhanced mode.<ref name=TVDogPics />\n\n=== Peripherals ===\n\n==== Monitors ====\nTandy offered two color monitors specific for its Tandy 1000 computers: the CM-5, with a 0.64 millimeter dot pitch,<ref>{{cite web|title=CM-5 specifications|url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_accessories/doc4/4842.htm|website=radioshacksupport dot com|publisher=Tandy Corporation|access-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref> and the Tandy CM-11 with a dot pitch of 0.42&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|title=CM-11 specifications|url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_accessories/doc6/6012.htm|website=radioshacksupport dot com|publisher=Tandy Corporation|access-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref> Both are 13-inch displays and have a power cable and a nine-pin RGB cable to attach to the Tandy CGA port.

As it uses a CGA-compatible interface, non-Tandy monitors that support CGA should work.\n\n==== Keyboard ====\nThe original Tandy 1000, SX, EX, TX, HX use a proprietary keyboard and keyboard layout that is not compatible with the PC/XT/AT standard. The layout of the keyboard prefigured the [[IBM Model M]] keyboard, with function keys arranged in a row at the top, instead of on the left as in the PC and PC XT/AT. Later models of the Tandy 1000 series, such as the 1000 SL, TL, and RL series use a keyboard more similar and compatible with the IBM PS/2 series keyboard connector and layout.\n\n==== Mouse options ====\nAs the Tandy 1000 uses the same game ports as the Tandy Color Computer series, the 26-3025 Color Mouse and 26-3125 Deluxe Mouse are compatible with the Tandy 1000, though not all DOS software and drivers recognize them. The Tandy Digi-Mouse requires a separate controller that was available in either ISA or PLUS format. Systems with RS-232C serial ports can use standard serial mice, and later systems, such as the 1000 RL, feature a PS/2 mouse connector.\n\n==== Joystick options ====\n\nRadio Shack offered a one-button joystick with its proprietary 6-pin DIN joystick connector that is compatible with the older [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] but not standard 15-pin IBM PC game ports often found on sound cards and i/o multifunction ISA cards. It works with many games written to take advantage of Tandy graphics and sound.\n\n==== Modem options ====\n\nRadio Shack offered Tandy 1000 PLUS 300-Baud PC Modem that is compatible with the 1000EX/HX that used PLUS slots. Radio Shack also offered 2400-baud internal modem. Third party modems with speeds of 14k baud should work provided they are eight-bit ISA, and fit.\n\n==== Printers ====\nRadio Shack sold the Tandy DMP-130A dot matrix printers to go along with their Tandy 1000 line, along with compatible card-edged printer cable. This printer was sold at home budget prices. Radio Shack often offered a package bundle with a Tandy 1000 computer, CM-5 budget monitor and DMP-130A printer. Using specially-designed aftermarket cables, it is possible to connect non-Tandy printers to the system.\n\n==== Apple IIe compatibility ====\n \nTandy wanted to compete in the education, school and home markets dominated by the [[Apple IIe]]. In 1987, the company partnered with [[Diamond Multimedia|Diamond]] and through Radio Shack sold the [[Diamond Trackstar 128]] series Apple IIe compatibility board for $399, and offered free installation in their Tandy 1000 series. This peripheral is similar to the [[Apple IIe Card]] sold later for certain Macintosh models; it is a fully functional Apple IIe clone with 128KB RAM and 6502 CPU and double high-resolution graphics, which allows Tandy 1000 computers to run software written for the Apple IIe and IIc platform. It was also marketed to home users and businesses interested in having both MS-DOS and Apple II compatibility.\n\nThe board has a pass-through RGB cable and floppy drive cable, and requires an open 10-inch 8-bit ISA slot, and uses a boot disk to boot into Apple mode. The boot disk has both DOS and Apple software and is [[Copy protection|copy-protected]]. Compatibility is fairly good and allows Tandy 1000 owners to run most Apple II software on their Tandy 1000 machine for less than the cost of owning separate IBM PC and Apple II systems.\n\nMany Tandy 1000s sold to schools came with the Diamond Trackstar 128 installed,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.applelogic.org/Trackstar.html|title = Trackstar}}</ref> and home owners also purchased this for compatibility with both DOS and Apple II software.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.diskman.com/presents/trackstar/|title = Trackstar: The Apple II clone inside an IBM PC}}</ref>\n\n== System specifications ==\n=== Full-size desktop systems ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!\n![[#Tandy 1000|1000/A]][[#Tandy 1000 HD|/HD]]\n![[#1000 SX|1000 SX]]\n![[#1000 TX|1000 TX]]\n![[#1000 SL and SL/2|1000 SL, SL/2]]\n![[#1000 TL, TL/2 and TL/3|1000 TL, TL/2, TL/3]]\n|-\n|Processor\n|Intel 8088 running at 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n|8088 running at 7.16 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n|Intel 80286 running at 8 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n*16-bit memory data path<ref name=TXtechref />\n|Intel 8086 running at 8 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n|\n*TL, TL/2: 80286 running at 8 or 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n*TL/3: 80286 running at 10 or 5&nbsp;MHz\n|-\n|RAM\n|128KB minimum;

The floppy drives use jumpers to select the drive number instead of the IBM cable twist. The standard memory is {{nowrap|128 KB}}, with the computer accepting up to {{nowrap|640 KB}} of total memory with the addition of expansion cards.\n\nMS-DOS 2.11, [[DeskMate]] 1.0, and a keyboard with the same layout as the [[Tandy 2000]]'s are included with the computer. Like the PCjr, the Tandy 1000 motherboard does not supply DMA, but unlike that system, it can have DMA added with a memory expansion board. While the Tandy 1000 has three XT-compatible expansion slots, early Tandy memory upgrade boards take up two of the slots to get to {{nowrap|640 KB}}. Because the slots are {{frac|11|1|2}} inches in length instead of the PC's 13 inches, full-length cards do not fit,{{r|malloy198508}} but reviewers noted that the many built-in hardware features reduce the need for cards.{{r|rosch19851015}}\n\nA later revision of the original Tandy 1000 model is the Tandy 1000A. This revision fixed bugs, scans expansion cards for bootable ROMs, and adds a socket for an [[Intel 8087]] math coprocessor.\n\n===Tandy 1000 HD===\nThe original Tandy 1000 (and many other models), like most home computers sold at the time, does not have a hard disk drive. The Tandy 1000 HD is essentially a Tandy 1000A with a hard disk option factory installed.  The factory hard disk has a capacity on the order of 10 or 20 MB.\n\n===Tandy 1000 SX and TX===\n[[File:Tandy 1000 SX with IBM Monitor.jpg|thumb|A Tandy 1000 SX with an IBM monitor, running ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'']]\nThe Tandy 1000 SX and TX are upgraded versions of the original Tandy 1000, utilizing a similar chassis. Two major upgrades over the original Tandy 1000 are the inclusion of a [[Direct memory access|DMA]] controller, which improved the speed of diskette operations and IBM PC-compatibility of these systems, and the addition of two additional ISA expansion slots, to offer a total of five 8-bit ISA slots.\n\n====1000 SX====\nThe Tandy 1000 SX uses a 7.16&nbsp;MHz 8088-2 processor, has 384&nbsp;KB of memory (upgradeable to 640&nbsp;KB on the motherboard), comes with either one or two 5.25\" internal floppy disk drives, and has the light pen port (not a serial port) like the original Tandy 1000.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Mark |date=August 1987 |title=The Tandy 1000 SX |pages=33 |work=80 Micro |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1987-08/page/n33/mode/2up}}</ref> An adjustable potentiometer inside the system controls the volume of the internal speaker. The Tandy AX is an SX rebadged for sale in [[Walmart]] stores. The 1000 SX comes with MS-DOS 3.2 and DeskMate II on 5.25\" 360&nbsp;KB diskettes.\n\nThe SX is the first Tandy 1000 in which the built-in video circuitry can be disabled via the installation of an upgraded graphics card, typically an [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] or [[Video Graphics Array|VGA card]], in an expansion slot.\n\n====1000 TX====\nThe Tandy 1000 TX is similar to the 1000 SX with its detached keyboard, unique parallel port edge connector, and XT-style architecture in a slightly modified case.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Williams |first=David |date=March 1988 |title=The 1000 TX: Vive la Difference! |pages=31–34 |work=80 Micro |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1988-03/page/n31/mode/2up}}</ref> The major difference is the 80286 CPU clocked at 8&nbsp;MHz. It features a 16-bit-wide memory bus, although the on-board peripherals and ISA slots are 8 bits wide.<ref name=\"TXtechref\">{{Cite book |url=ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/tandy1000/documents/txtech.zip |title=Tandy 1000 TX - Technical Reference Manual |publisher=Radio Shack |year=1988 |access-date=2023-05-30 |archive-date=2022-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220806034959/http://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/tandy1000/documents/txtech.zip |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref>\n\nThe TX has a 3.5\" internal floppy disk drive mounted in a 5.25\" bay with room for an optional second internal 3.5\" or 5.25\" floppy disk drive. The rear panel has the same ports as the 1000 SX, except that an RS-232C serial port replaces the light-pen port. The memory size is 640 KB, with sockets for an additional 128 KB devoted to the onboard video logic. This extra 128&nbsp;KB can only be used for and by the on-board video controller, so it is impractical to expand the on-board memory beyond 640&nbsp;KB if a VGA graphics card is installed. The computer comes bundled with Personal DeskMate 2.\n\nThe TX is the last 1000-series computer to use DIP switches to store the system configuration parameters. All later 1000s rely on serial [[EEPROM]] chips to store configuration settings.\n\n===Tandy 1000 EX and HX===\nThe Tandy 1000 EX and HX were designed as entry-level IBM-compatible personal computers, and marketed as starter systems for people new to computing. They were offered in a compact, all-in-one chassis that features a 7.16&nbsp;MHz 8088 (capable of clocking down to 4.77&nbsp;MHz), 256&nbsp;KB of memory (expandable to 640&nbsp;KB with a PLUS memory expansion board), PCjr- and CGA-compatible Tandy Video graphics controller, a keyboard and, depending on the model, either a single 5.25\" 360&nbsp;KB floppy drive, or one to two 3.5\" 720&nbsp;KB floppy drives.\n\nAn external floppy drive can be connected to a port on the back. The machine itself supplies power to the external drive, so only Tandy's floppy drive unit is usable with the EX and HX. The external drive is the standard 360&nbsp;KB 5.25\" format; in 1988 a 720&nbsp;KB 3.5\" model was offered.\n\nThe EX and HX are upgradable via Tandy PLUS cards, and these systems have bays for three cards. A PLUS card connector is electrically identical to an ISA slot connector, but uses a [[Berg connector|Berg-style]] 62-pin connector instead of a 62-contact ISA card-edge connector. Other PLUS cards can be installed to add serial ports, a 1200-baud modem, a clock/calendar and bus mouse board, or a proprietary Tandy network interface. Radio Shack later sold an adapter card allowing installation of a PLUS card into a standard ISA slot, such as those in the larger Tandy 1000 models.\n\nLike the original Tandy 1000, the EX and HX do not have a built-in DMA controller, though one can be added using the PLUS memory expansion board.\n\n====1000 EX====\n[[File:Sabu with his Tandy 1000 Computer.jpg|right|thumb|A cat resting on a Tandy 1000 EX computer]]\nThe Tandy 1000 EX features a 5.25\" floppy drive built into the right-hand side of computer casing.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Mark |date=May 1987 |title=Tandy 1000 EX |pages=28–31 |work=80 Micro |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1987-05/page/n29/mode/2up}}</ref> The EX sold for US$1,000 from Radio Shack in December 1986. The EX and, later, the HX were among the most popular of the Tandy 1000 line because of their low price.\n\nA useful feature for the EX and later systems is the ability to boot off either drive, as the drives can be logically swapped when the system booted, so that the drive that was normally drive B: becomes drive A:, and vice versa, and the drives remain swapped until the system is powered off or reset.  (The SX and TX have this capability as well.)\n\nThe 1000 EX comes with MS-DOS 2.11 and Personal Deskmate on 5.25\" 360&nbsp;KB diskettes. The MS-DOS is a version specialized for and only bootable on the Tandy 1000; it includes a version of BASICA (Microsoft's Advanced GW-BASIC) with support for the enhanced CGA graphics modes (a.k.a. Tandy Graphics or TGA) and three-voice sound hardware of the Tandy 1000.\n\n====1000 HX====\n[[Image:Tandy1000HX tweaked.jpg|thumbnail|right|285px|A Tandy 1000 HX, with a Tandy RGB monitor, an external 5.25-inch disk drive, joystick, and a Tandy DMP-133 [[dot matrix]] [[Computer printer|printer]]]]\nThe Tandy 1000 HX is an updated version of the EX, released in 1987. It utilizes the same architecture and PLUS cards as the EX, but with two 3.5\" bays on the front panel, occupied by one or two 720 KB 3.5\" floppy drives, as opposed to a single side-mounted 5.25\" bay and floppy drive. It also has [[Tandy MS-DOS 2.11R]] in ROM, which can be accessed by starting the computer with no bootable disk. Another improvement over the EX is the addition of a serial EEPROM to store configuration information, enabling similar functionality to later CMOS NVRAMs. By comparison, earlier Tandy 1000 models, like IBM PC and PC/XT systems, use DIP switches and jumpers for startup configuration settings.\n\nBy putting the basic elements of DOS in ROM and eliminating the memory test on startup, the HX boots quickly compared to other contemporary MS-DOS machines, despite having no immediate provisions for a hard disk drive.\n\nIn addition to Tandy MS-DOS 2.11R, the HX shipped with Personal Deskmate 2. Most versions of MS-DOS works with the 1000 HX, including DOS 3.x and some later versions; DOS 4.0 is incompatible, and the installer for MS-DOS 6 can corrupt the contents of the serial EEPROM.<ref name=dos60ref />\n\n===Tandy 1000 SL and TL series===\nThe Tandy SL and TL series of computers are updates of the SX and TX, respectively. In addition to offering redesigned cases, the machines offer a more integrated motherboard with improved graphics and sound capabilities while dropping composite video output. The graphics controller supports {{nowrap|640 × 200 × 16}} resolution as well as a [[Hercules Graphics Card]]-compatible, {{nowrap|720 × 350}} mode for monochrome monitors. Sound capabilities now include an 8-bit monaural DAC/ADC similar in function to [[parallel port]] sound devices (such as the [[Covox Speech Thing]] and [[Disney Sound Source]]) but extended to support DMA transfers, microphone input capability, and sampling rates up to 48&nbsp;kHz. The SL/TL allow the on-board floppy controller, parallel port and serial ports to be disabled, which the earlier models do not.\n\nThe SL and TL were shipped with MS-DOS 3.3 and [[DeskMate]] 3 in ROM, and feature a serial [[EEPROM]] memory chip to store BIOS settings. The machines can also run generic MS-DOS 3.x, 5.x, and 6.x and Windows 2.x and 3.0 operating systems, although Windows is limited to real-mode operations. In common with many PC clones of the era, MS-DOS 4 is problematic and generally avoided.\n\n====1000 SL and SL/2====\n[[File:SL Sound Satellite.JPG|thumb|right|The SL's sound/reset satellite board]]\nThe Tandy 1000 SL and SL/2 feature an [[Intel 8086]] processor running at 8&nbsp;MHz. This is socketed, and thus upgradeable with an [[NEC V30]].<ref name=\"Great Hierophant\">{{cite web |title=Benefits and Drawbacks of the Late Model Tandy 1000s, CPU Upgradability |url=http://nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com/search?q=tandy+sl%2F2 |website=Nerdly Pleasures |publisher=Great Hierophant |access-date=May 13, 2019}}</ref> The SL comes with {{nowrap|384 KB}} of RAM preinstalled, whereas the SL/2 offers {{nowrap|512 KB}}. Both machines can be expanded to {{nowrap|640 KB}}, although the graphics controller reserves a portion of this memory, yielding only {{nowrap|608 KB}} to the operating system, even on systems using add-in ISA graphic cards. The SL line has the mic/earphone ports, volume knob, and reset button on a small satellite board. A jumper on the board allows the user to change the microphone input to a line-level output.<ref name=\"radioshacksupport\">{{cite book | url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_computer/doc1/1262.htm | title=Tandy faxback document #1262 | access-date=September 6, 2014 | date=1995-04-26 }}</ref> The SL series offers five 8-bit XT-compatible ISA slots, and does not come with pre-installed [[real-time clock]] chips, making them optional upgrades in the form of the plug-in Dallas DS1216E SmartWatch.\n\nThe SL is the only machine in the line that offers an upper 5.25\" bay, and therefore the only model to offer two 5.25\" bays, where the other models, including the SL/2 and the entire TL range, feature two upper 3.5\" bays and one lower 5.25\" bay. As a result, fitting a hard drive to an SL that already has the upper and lower 5.25\" bays populated may require either the removal of one of the devices in those bays, or the installation of a hard disk card-style bracket which seats in one of the ISA slots.\n\n====1000 TL, TL/2 and TL/3====\nThe Tandy 1000 TL and TL/2 uses 8&nbsp;MHz Intel 80286 processors, whereas the TL/3 uses a 10&nbsp;MHz 80286. The TLs has 640&nbsp;KB of memory preinstalled, with an option for an extra 128&nbsp;KB for video frame buffering just as in the 1000 TX. Unlike the SL series machines, the TL series comes with the SmartWatch real-time clock logic built-in, which is powered by a removable 3-volt CR2032 button-cell battery on the motherboard.\n\nThe TL offers five 8-bit XT-compatible ISA slots, while the TL/2 and TL/3 offer four slots and an on-board 8-bit, XT IDE-compatible hard disk interface, which is not compatible with standard AT IDE hard drives. The TL series offers two upper 3.5\" bays and one lower 5.25\" bay, and has a high-density floppy drive controller for 1.44 MB drives, though it comes with a double-density 3.5\" 720 KB drive.\n\nAs the processors on the TL-series are socketed, it is possible to install 386SX or Cyrix 486SLC-based processor upgrades, though the benefit of installing more advanced processors is limited beyond merely providing a speed increase due to the computers' XT-based architecture, and their resulting inability to access [[extended memory]] above 1 MB.<ref name=\"Great Hierophant\"/>\n\n===Tandy 1000 RL-series and RSX===\n[[File:Tandy 1000 rl 1.jpg|thumb|A Tandy 1000 RL running DeskMate (optional mouse not shown)]]\nThe Tandy 1000 RL/RLX/RSX are slim-line desktop home computers. They have a much more compact case, with at least 512&nbsp;KB of memory pre-installed, smaller [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]]-style keyboard and mouse ports, and at least one ISA expansion slot. The RL-series and RSX include provisions for an internal hard disk drive, depending on the model: the RL-series features a built-in [[Industry Standard Architecture#XT-IDE|XT-IDE]] hard drive interface, while the RSX features an AT-compatible [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] interface. The keyboard connectors of the RL-series, while similar to and mechanically compatible with PS/2-style connectors, are not fully compatible with typical PS/2 keyboards, as the keyboard uses the XT keyboard protocol. The RSX, however, incorporates the AT keyboard protocol, making it the first 1000-series system to offer more complete compatibility with typical PS/2 keyboards, and AT keyboards using an adapter.\n\n====1000 RL and RL/HD====\nThe RL and RL/HD features a surface-mounted {{nowrap|9.54 MHz}} 8086 processor, 512&nbsp;KB of RAM (expandable to 768&nbsp;KB to provide 128&nbsp;KB for video and 640&nbsp;KB conventional memory), a DB-25 unidirectional parallel port instead of the edge-connector ports, and the SL's enhanced graphics and sound. A single half-size 8-bit expansion slot is available. The RL/HD has a battery-backed real-time clock chip to store date and time information.   The RL lacks this and requires a plug-in Smartwatch chip. These models also has MS-DOS and a portion of DeskMate in ROM, and can therefore boot much faster than many other computers on the market. The RL/HD comes with a 20MB drive preinstalled.\n\n====1000 RLX====\n[[File:Tandy 1000 RLX front view.jpg|thumb|Front view of a Tandy 1000 RLX]]\nThe RLX is the 'mid-range' offering of the RL line. It has a 10&nbsp;MHz 286 (surface-mounted) and 512 KB of RAM, and unlike other 286-based Tandy 1000 models, it supports 384&nbsp;KB of extended memory when RAM is expanded to the maximum 1 MB. However, it is not a full AT-class machine, as it still has an 8-bit ISA bus (as with the RL, one half-size expansion slot) and only 8 IRQs and 4 DMA channels. While the three-voice sound chip and DAC are still present, Tandy video was dropped in favor of an AcuMos [[VGA]] controller offering 256 KB of video memory and standard VGA graphics resolutions. The parallel port is bidirectional, a first for the Tandy 1000 series. The RLX has one 1.44 MB 3.5\" floppy drive; an empty drive bay can host a second such drive. The hard disk RLX/HD comes with a 20&nbsp;MB hard disk and 1 MB RAM preinstalled. The hard disk occupies the empty drive bay, so this version supports only a single floppy drive.\n\n====1000 RSX====\nA more upscale offering, the RSX offers a 25&nbsp;MHz 80386SX processor, 1 MB RAM, two 16-bit ISA slots, AcuMos SVGA video, a bidirectional parallel port, and standard PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports. It is a full 386-class PC and can run Microsoft Windows 3.x. Two sockets for SIMM memory cards are available. Only 1 MB or 4 MB SIMMs of the 9-chip type are supported, and if two are installed they have to be of like capacity. With two 4 MB SIMMs installed, the 1000 RSX can be expanded to 9 MB RAM without using an ISA slot. The RSX/HD variant comes with a 52 MB hard drive using an AT-compatible IDE interface; replacement hard drives up to 504 MB can be substituted. Because of the slimline case, only one hard drive can be installed alongside the 1.44 MB 3.5\" floppy drive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tandy 1000 RSX specifications|url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_computer/doc1/1332.htm|website=Radio Shack Support|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tandy 1000 Rl/RLX Pictures|url=http://www.oldskool.org/guides/tvdog/RLRLX.html|website=Oldskool.org|publisher=TV Dog|access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe motherboard has a socket for the 80387SX math coprocessor. The RSX still retains the Tandy 1000 3-voice sound hardware and DAC, though the I/O address for the 3-voice sound chip was moved, rendering many games compatible with it unable to play music unless modified. The DAC can be used to emulate the Covox Speech Thing via MS-DOS device drivers for limited sound support. This works with ''[[Chuck Yeager's Air Combat]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/chuck-yeagers-air-combat/techinfo|title=Chuck Yeager's Air Combat for DOS (1991) Tech Info|website=MobyGames|access-date=2016-08-08}}</ref>\n\nWindows 3.xx sound device drivers are available that work in Windows 95 (with full 9MB RAM) on Tandy 1000 RSX.\nThe ACUMOS VGA graphics can be software-updated with Cirrus Logic BIOS (via MS-DOS driver) to allow VESA/SVGA to function in Windows 95, as the Windows 3.xx Tandy VGA drivers are insufficient for Windows 95.\n\n==Selected Tandy 1000-enhanced software==\n{{unsourced section|date=May 2023}}\nMajor software publishers and makers of game and educational software, such as [[Sierra On-line|Sierra]] and [[Broderbund]], offered software titles that support Tandy's 16-color graphics, 3-voice sound, and other Tandy-specific hardware features. These enhancements offer a superior graphics and sound experience for Tandy 1000 owners over CGA graphics or PC speaker sound widely used on most DOS PCs. Software that supported Tandy's graphics are typically labelled on the package as Tandy 1000/PCjr compatible.\n\nAlthough the Tandy 1000 can run most DOS software, the below programs are known to specifically support Tandy 1000 enhanced features. These programs require DOS to run. Tandy shipped its own version of DOS. The 1000 uses the main memory for graphics, so most programs require 640k or 768k to run. The enhanced graphics and sound often tax the processor, so an 80286 processor or faster is often recommended for best results.\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''[[A-10 Tank Killer]]''\n*''[[Alley Cat (video game)|Alley Cat]]''\n*''[[Arkanoid]]''<ref name=\"taito8901\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Computer Gaming World |type=Advertising |title=Five ways to make you PC scream|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_55/page/n10/mode/1up?view=theater |issue=55 |page=10-11 |date=January 1989 |quote=FULL 16 COLOR EGA AND TANDY GRAPHICS. 4 COLOR CGA ALSO SUPPORTED}}</ref>\n*''[[Caveman Ugh-Lympics]]''\n*''[[Choplifter]]''\n*''[[Defender of the Crown]]''\n*''[[Digger (video game)|Digger]]''\n*''[[Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist]]''\n*''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]''\n*''[[King's Quest]]'' 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\n*''[[Knights of the Sky]]''\n*''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]''\n*''[[LHX Attack Chopper]]''\n*''[[Loom (video game)|Loom]]''\n*''[[Mario Teaches Typing]]''\n*''[[Operation Wolf]]''\n*''[[Out Run]]''\n*''[[Police Quest]]''\n*''[[Rastan (video game)|Rastan]]''\n*''[[Reader Rabbit]]''\n*''[[RoboCop (1988 video game)|RoboCop]]''\n*''[[Sargon (chess)|Sargon]]''\n*''[[Sentinel Worlds I: Future Magic]]''\n*''[[Shogun (video game)|Shogun]]''\n*''[[Silpheed]]''\n*''[[Skate or Die!|Skate or Die]]''\n*''[[Space Quest]]'' 1, 2, and 3\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES video game)#Ports|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''\n*''[[The Bard's Tale (1985 video game)|The Bard's Tale]]''\n*''[[The Black Cauldron (video game)|The Black Cauldron]]''\n*''[[The Cycles: International Grand Prix Racing]]''\n*''[[The Three Stooges (video game)|The Three Stooges]]''\n*''[[Thexder]]'' 1 and 2\n*''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?

These elements included, but were not limited to:\n\n*Data Facility Storage Management Subsystem Data Facility Product (DFP){{snd}}Provides [[access method]]s to enable I/O to, e.g., [[Direct access storage device|DASD]] subsystems, printers, Tape; provides utilities and program management\n*[[Job Entry Subsystem 2/3|Job Entry Subsystem]] (JES){{snd}}Provides the ability to submit batch work and manage print\n*[[IBM Communications Server]]{{snd}}Provides [[VTAM]] and [[TCP/IP]] communications protocols\n\nAn additional benefit of the OS/390 packaging concept was to improve [[reliability, availability and serviceability]] (RAS) for the operating system, as the number of different combinations of elements that a customer could order and run was drastically reduced.  This reduced the overall time required for customers to test and deploy the operating system in their environments, as well as reducing the number of customer-reported problems (PMRs), errors ([[Authorized Program Analysis Report|APARs]]) and fixes ([[Program temporary fix|PTFs]]) arising from the variances in element levels.\n\nIn December 2001 IBM extended OS/390 to include support for 64-bit [[zSeries]] processors and added various other improvements, and the result is now named [[z/OS]]. IBM ended support for the older OS/390-branded versions in late 2004.\n\n==See also==\n* [[OS/360]]\n* [[MVS]]\n* [[z/OS]]\n* [[z/TPF]]\n* [[z/VM]]\n* [[z/VSE]]\n* [[Linux on IBM Z]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{IBM operating systems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Os 390}}\n[[Category:IBM mainframe operating systems]]\n[[Category:IBM ESA/390 operating systems]]\n[[Category:1995 software]]\n\n{{operating-system-stub}}\n{{mainframe-compu-stub}}","_bytes":4560,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2023-09-01T00:04:10Z"},"title":"OS/390","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}

Microware also released a version for OS-9/68k on the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] as '''Microware BASIC'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geneslinuxbox.net:6309/gene/nitros9/3rdparty/packages/basic09/ReadMe.b09 |title=BASIC09 |website=Geneslinuxbox.net:6309 |access-date=2016-11-27}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to typical BASICs of the era, BASIC09 includes a multi-pass [[compiler]] that produces compact [[bytecode]] known as '''I-code'''. I-code replaces a number of data structures found in other BASICs with direct pointers to code and values, speeding performance. Users can further compile code using the <code>PACK</code> command, at which point it can be called directly by OS-9 and operated as native code. In the case of PACKed code, a cut-down version of the BASIC09 [[runtime system]] is used, '''Runb''', further improving [[memory footprint]] and load time.\n\nThe language includes a number of [[structured programming]] additions, including [[local variable]]s, the ability to ignore line numbers in favor of named routines, user-defined structures, and several distinct base data types including 16-bit and 8-bit (byte) integers, in addition to floating point and strings.\n\n==Syntax==\n===Program organization===\nA key difference between BASIC09 and conventional BASICs of the era, like the canonical [[Microsoft BASIC]], is the addition of the <code>PROCEDURE</code> structure which created separately executable blocks of code. Code in a <code>PROCEDURE</code> had more in common with complete programs in other BASICs, including the variables being [[local variable|local]] to the code, and their ability to be executed in a stand-alone fashion. <code>PROCEDURE</code>s were called by name using the <code>RUN</code> command, and could include variables for function-call semantics; for instance, <code>RUN add(4,7)</code> calls a procedure named <code>add</code> that takes two parameters. Parameters were imported into the procedure using the <code>PARAM</code> keyword, in this example <code>PARAM a,b</code>:{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=5.1}}\n\n PROCEDURE add\n PARAM a,b\n PRINT a+b\n\nA side-effect of the use of named procedures is that the resulting memory workspace is, in effect, its own namespace. In this respect, the BASIC09 system appears to the user to be a directory of callable programs. This contrasts with typical BASICs, where only one program is available at a given time and the construction of larger programs calling library-like code generally requires the [[source code]] to be copied and pasted between separate programs. In BASIC09, the user can <code>LOAD</code> procedures by name into the workspace and then call them from their own code to construct larger programs from the separately stored procedures.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=3.5}}{{efn|The [[GRASS (programming language)|GRASS]] system was similar in that its BASIC-like language could be assembled from separate named procedures, but did so by leaving everything as untokenized source code, as opposed to pre-compiling as in BASIC09.}}\n\nIn addition to code in the workspace, if the program invokes <code>RUN</code> with a procedure name that could not be found, it would then look for a disk file with the same name and load and run that file. This worked not only with BASIC09 code, but also any other executable program, including [[machine language]] files. This meant that BASIC09 could easily call system routines.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=9.12}}\n\nIn addition to <code>RUN</code>, other common BASIC commands likewise used names. For instance, <code>LIST bob</code> would print out the source code (\"list\") the procedure named \"bob\", while <code>LIST*</code> prints out all of the procedures currently in memory. The prettyprinted output from <code>LIST</code> could be redirected to a file or a printer with a shell-like notation, e.g. <code>LIST bob >/p</code>. One could also <code>SAVE</code> and <code>LOAD</code> procedures from storage.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=2.9}}\n\n===Structured programming===\nIn addition to the organizational properties of the <code>PROCEDURE</code>, BASIC09 also included a number of extensions to the  [[flow control (data)|flow control]] statements found in BASIC to provide more structure. For instance, the <code>IF</code> statement could be used in the traditional <code>IF</code>...<code>THEN</code> format on a single line, or it could be used in a structured multi-line format:{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=9.4}}\n\n IF x>10 THEN\n   PRINT \"x is larger than 10\"\n ELSE\n  PRINT \"x is smaller than 10\"\n ENDIF\n\n<code>FOR/NEXT</code> loops naturally have a structured format as the <code>NEXT</code> can be placed on any line, but BASIC09 also added <code>WHILE/ENDWHILE</code> and <code>REPEAT/UNTIL</code> for additional clarity when working with non-indexed loops.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=9.6-9.7}} It also included the center-exit <code>LOOP/ENDLOOP</code> which used the <code>EXITIF</code> statement for testing anywhere in the loop's body.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=9.8}}\n\n===Data types===\nBASIC09 included several built-in data types. In addition to the traditional string (STRING) and 40-bit floating point (REAL) types found in most BASICs of the era, it also included the 16-bit signed INTEGER, the 8-bit unsigned BYTE, and the logical BOOLEAN type. The BOOLEAN types were not [[Data structure alignment|packed]] into bytes, a single BOOLEAN used an entire 8-bit byte to store a single value. The language provided separate bytewise [[boolean function|boolean operators]] for bitwise operations on BYTEs and INTEGERs.{{sfn|Manual|1984|pp=7.2-7.6}} In contrast to other BASICs that also operated different base types, BASIC09 did not \"decorate\" the variable name to indicate the type, and instead used the <code>DIM</code> for definitions; for instance, <code>DIM a,b:BOOLEAN</code> to declare two BOOLEAN variables, or <code>DIM c(5):INTEGER</code> for an array of five INTEGERs.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=7.6}}\n\nAdditionally, BASIC09 included the <code>TYPE</code> keyword, which allowed compound types to be defined, with each \"element\" listed on a single line separated by semicolons. For instance:{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=7.8}}\n\n TYPE employee_record=name:STRING;number(2):INTEGER;former:BOOLEAN\n\ndefines an employee record type named <code>employee_record</code> with three elements, <code>name</code>, <code>number</code> and <code>former</code>. The employee_record type can now be used in a definition like any other type, for instance, <code>DIM employees(100):employee_record</code>, which defines an array of 100 employee_record's. The elements are accessed in code using dot notation, for instance, <code>employees(50).name=\"Bob\"</code>.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=7.8}}\n\n==Runtime==\n===Editing===\nLine numbers were used in most BASIC dialects primarily as a way to support the editor. Users would edit particular lines of code by typing a number, with the text following either adding to or replacing the lines already in memory. As every line of code had a number, this also made them suitable for indicating the target of a <code>GOTO</code> or <code>GOSUB</code>, compared to other languages like [[FORTRAN]] where a separate \"line label\" was used for this purpose.\n\nBASIC09 did not normally use line numbers, so its editor had to be modified to allow the user to edit lines without referring to them by number. However, BASIC09 did not assume any sort of full-screen capability, so using [[cursor keys]] was not an option. Instead, the system had a separate editor prompt and allowed the user to move about using the {{tt|+}} and {{tt|-}} keys, moving forward or backward one line at a time. To insert a new line of code without a line number, the user left a blank at the start of the statement.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=2.3}}\n\nNote that the language is [[case sensitive]] for user-provided values like procedure and variable names, but not for keywords. Keywords typed into the editor in lower case will be shown in upper case when the program is <code>LIST</code>ed.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=2.5}} BASIC09 allowed multiple statements on a single line of code, but used the {{tt|\\}} as a separator instead of the {{tt|:}} used in most dialects.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=9.1}}{{efn|The colon was being used for the data type in the <code>DIM</code> statements.}} This is because it used the colon in the <code>:=</code> assignment operator, which was in addition to the normal <code>=</code>. <code>:=</code> was identical in effect to <code>=</code>, but made the difference between assignments and comparisons more obvious.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=9.2}}\n\n===Compiler===\nThe internal multipass compiler converts BASIC09 [[source code]] into a [[Lexical analysis|token]]ized, optimized, [[bytecode]], called I-code.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=11.1}} I-code differs from the more traditional tokenizing approach found in most BASICs in that a number of items were placed directly in memory instead of using references that then had to be looked up.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=11.2}}\n\nFor instance, in MS-based interpreters, a variable reference in code is left in string format; the variable <code>VAR</code> would be represented in memory by the three [[ASCII]] characters \"VAR\". During execution, when this variable is encountered in the code the interpreter has to look up that string in a table of variables, find the associated storage address in memory, and then finally read the value stored in that location. The table is usually constructed so that the value follows the name, to save time during the final lookup.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=11.1}}\n\nIn contrast, in I-code the address of the variable is determined in advance and the reference in code is replaced by that address. This avoids a runtime search through the variable table.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=11.1}} Other optimizations include a separate <code>FOR/NEXT</code> routine used when the index variable is an INTEGER, and separate INTEGER and REAL math libraries.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=11.2}}{{efn|Atari BASIC also worked in this way, the source code was compiled to tokens when the line was entered and any variable references replaced by a pointer to storage.}}\n\nFor added performance, BASIC09 also included the <code>PACK</code> command which took a procedure name and returned an optimized version. Some of these optimizations included removing non-coding instructions like code comments and the replacement of constant expressions to a single value. For instance, <code>PACK</code> would recognize that <code>LET x=x+SQR(100)/2</code> contains only constants on the right, and replaces it with the code <code>x=x+5</code>, which requires only a single operation at runtime, the addition, removing the division and square root. <code>PACK</code> reduced the memory footprint of the procedure and improved performance by about 10 to 30%.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=11.3}}\n\n===Lightweight runtime===\nAlthough it was common to run programs within the BASIC09 environment, as it was in other BASICs, BASIC09 also shipped with a separate run-only version of the code known as Runb. Runb removed the editing and debugging features of the system, and was about half the size of the full BASIC09 as a result.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=D.1}}\n\nThe purpose of Runb was primarily to run PACKed modules when called from other programs. This meant that if the user typed in the name of a BASIC09 module in the OS/9 command line, and that module has been marked as PACKed, it is opened and run by Runb instead of the BASIC09. This reduces memory footprint and improves load time.{{sfn|Manual|1984|p=D.1}}\n\n==Significant features==\n* reasonably structured control flow provisions (e.g., line numbers were mainly needed for computed <code>[[GOTO]]</code>, as BASIC09 did not have a switch/case statement, or computed <code>[[GOSUB]]</code>)\n* structure declaration (rare in any BASIC variant then; more common in later BASIC implementations)\n* intrinsic integer and [[Boolean data type]]s\n* more than two significant characters in variable names (some BASICs of the time allowed only one, many [[Microsoft BASIC]] variants allowed only two)\n* procedures with local variables (indeed, ''all'' variables in BASIC09 are local to procedures) and parameter passing by reference\n* a reasonable [[debug]]ger (its only significant drawback was that one could not examine the contents of fields in structures)\n* a way to interface to [[machine language]] code, which could be passed parameters using the BASIC09 calling sequence\n* automatic [[prettyprint]]ing of source, which enforced a standard layout and avoided the ghastly mess that was the usual appearance of a program of any size in the interpreted BASICs of the time. Programmers normally would cram as many lines together as possible to avoid line number memory overhead—not a problem in BASIC09<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/68micro-vol-09-num-04/V09N04_Apr1987#page/n15/mode/1up Basically OS-9], By Ron Voigts, 68 Micro Journal, Volume 09 Number 04, April 1984, Page 14, ''One of its strong features is its handling of formatted output.

The winners of three races were disqualified after blood tests showed that three skiers had overly high red blood cell counts indicating the use of [[darbepoetin]], a drug used to treat [[anemia]].  At the time, the drug was not specifically listed in the [[International Olympic Committee]]'s (IOC) list of banned substances, but the Olympic rules generally prohibit [[doping (Sport)|doping]] of any kind, in accordance with its charter. After two years and several lawsuits in Olympic and Swiss courts, the skiers in question ([[Johann Mühlegg]] of Spain, and [[Larissa Lazutina]] and [[Olga Danilova]] of Russia) were stripped of all their medals from the 2002 Games.<ref name=\"SR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/2002/CCS/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417041009/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/2002/CCS/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 April 2020 |title=Cross Country Skiing at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games |work=Sports Reference |access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nSee the external links below for the official IOC press releases containing detailed information of the doping cases and their resolution, including initial, intermediate, and final amended results.

As the project advanced, the requirement to support IBM 8100 and Series/1 software was dropped.<ref name=\"schleicher-interview\" /> When IBM's engineers attempted to port the operating systems and software of their existing platforms, they discovered that it would be impossible without making extensive changes to the Iliad processor for each individual operating system – changes which the Iliad's architects were unwilling to make.{{sfnp|Soltis|1997|p={{pn|date=March 2022}}}} The proposed solution to this was to augment Iliad with operating system-specific co-processors which provided hardware support for a single operating system. However, the amount of logic needed in each co-processor grew until the co-processors became the main processor, and the Iliad was relegated to the role of a support processor – thus failing the goal of consolidating on a single processor architecture. The Fort Knox project was ultimately cancelled in 1985.\n\n[[File:IBM AS-400 9406-720.jpg|thumb|right|IBM AS/400]]\n[[Image:IBM eServer i5 570.jpg|thumb|right|IBM System i 570 server (as of 2006)]]\n\n=== Silverlake ===\nDuring the Fort Knox project, a [[skunkworks project]] was started at [[IBM Rochester]] by engineers who believed that Fort Knox's failure was inevitable.

The reassignment of two digit model numbers from midrange systems to personal systems was to prevent the personal systems from running out of single-digit numbers for new products.\n\n=== The move to PowerPC ===\n{{See also|IBM RS64#History}}\n\nIn 1990, IBM Rochester began work to replace the AS/400's original System/38-derived [[48-bit computing|48-bit]] [[complex instruction set computer|CISC]] processors with a 96-bit architecture known as ''C-RISC'' (Commercial [[RISC]]).{{sfnp|Soltis|1997|p={{pn|date=March 2022}}}} Rather than being a clean-slate design, C-RISC would have added RISC-style and [[VLIW]]-style instructions to the AS/400's processor, while maintaining backwards compatibility with the [[System/370]]-style ''Internal Microprogrammed Interface'' (IMPI) instruction set and the [[microcode]] used to implement it.\n\nIn 1991, at the request of IBM president [[Jack Kuehler]], a team under the leadership of [[Frank Soltis]] delivered a proposal to adapt the [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] [[PowerPC]] architecture to support the needs of the AS/400 platform.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Paul Shen|author2=Mikko H.

Most of these principles are inherited from System/38.{{sfnp|Soltis|2001|p=1–5, 97–177}}\n\n=== Technology Independence ===\n[[File:IBM AS-400e Model 150 (cropped).jpg |upright=0.6|thumb|right|IBM AS/400e Model 150]]\n\nThe high-level [[instruction set]] (called TIMI for \"Technology Independent Machine Interface\" by IBM), allows [[application program]]s to take advantage of advances in hardware and software without recompilation. TIMI is a [[p-code machine|virtual instruction set]] independent of the underlying machine instruction set of the CPU. User-mode programs contain both TIMI instructions and the machine instructions of the CPU, thus ensuring hardware independence. This is conceptually somewhat similar to the [[virtual machine]] architecture of programming environments such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]].\n\nUnlike some other virtual-machine architectures in which the virtual instructions are interpreted at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], TIMI instructions are never interpreted. They constitute an intermediate [[compile time]] step and are [[binary translation|translated into the processor's instruction set]] as the final compilation step. The TIMI instructions are stored within the final program object, in addition to the executable machine instructions. This is how application objects compiled on one processor family (e.g., the original [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] AS/400 48-bit processors) could be moved to a new processor (e.g., [[PowerPC]] 64-bit) without re-compilation. An application saved from the older 48-bit platform can simply be restored onto the new 64-bit platform where the operating system discards the old machine instructions and re-translates the TIMI instructions into 64-bit instructions for the new processor.\n\nThe system's instruction set defines all pointers as 128-bit. This was the original design feature of the [[IBM System/38|System/38]] (S/38) in the mid 1970s planning for future use of faster processors, memory and an expanded address space. The original AS/400 CISC models used the same 48-bit address space as the S/38. The address space was expanded in 1995 when the [[RISC]] [[PowerPC]] [[RS64]] 64-bit CPU processor replaced the 48-bit CISC processor.\n\n=== Software integration ===\n{{Main|IBM i}}\n\nOS/400 (now known as IBM i) is the native operating system of the AS/400 platform, and was the sole operating system supported on the original AS/400 hardware. Many of the advanced features associated with the AS/400 are implemented in the operating system as opposed to the underlying hardware, which changed significantly throughout the life of the AS/400 platform. Features include a [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]] ([[Db2 for i]]), a menu-driven interface, support for multiple users, [[block-oriented terminal]] support ([[IBM 5250]]), and printers.\n\n=== Object-based design ===\nUnlike the \"[[everything is a file]]\" principle of [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like|its derivatives]], on IBM i everything is an object (with built-in persistence and garbage collection).\n\n=== Single-level store ===\nIBM uses a [[single-level store]] virtual memory architecture in the AS/400 platform. For 64-bit PowerPC processors, the virtual address resides in the rightmost 64 bits of a pointer while it was 48 bits in the S/38 and CISC AS/400. The 64-bit address space references main memory and disk as a single address set which is the single-level store concept.\n\n=== Hardware integration ===\nLater generations of hardware are also capable of supporting various guest operating systems, including [[System Support Program|SSP]], [[IBM AIX|AIX]], [[Linux]], [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows Server 2003]]. While OS/400, AIX, and Linux are supported on the POWER processors on [[Logical partition (virtual computing platform)|LPARs (logical partitions)]], Windows is supported with either single-processor internal blade servers (IXS) or externally linked multiple-processor servers (IXA and iSCSI). SSP guests were supported using emulation from OS/400 V3R6 through V4R4 using the Advanced 36 Machine facility of the operating system, a feature distinct from the System/36 Environment compatibility layer which requires System/36 software to be recompiled.\n\n== Hardware ==\n\n=== CPUs ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n !CPU\n !Year\n !Clock Speed\n!\n!Server-Models\n|-\n |IMPI{{refn|group=note|There were at least two generations of IMPI processors, the second was released in 1991.<ref name=\"as400-processor-architecture\">{{cite conference|last1=Schmierer|first1=Q.G.|last2=Wottreng|first2=A.H.|title=&#91;1991 Proceedings&#93;

Meanwhile, the Byzantine fleet reaches the [[Danube|Danube River]] in order to block the way of [[Cumans|Cuman]] reinforcements from the North. The defense of Tarnovo is led by [[Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen I]], emperor ([[Tsar]]) of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. After spreading rumors of the arrival of a Cuman army to relieve the city, Isaac orders to retreat to [[Stara Zagora]]. \n* [[Battle of Tryavna]]: Byzantine forces under Isaac II are ambushed and defeated by the Bulgarians in a mountain pass, near [[Tryavna]]. In panic, the Byzantines break up and begin a disorganized retreat. Isaac barely escapes, his [[Varangian Guard]] has to cut a path through their own soldiers, enabling their emperor's flight from the rout. The Bulgarians capture the imperial treasure, including the golden helmet of Isaac, his crown, and the Imperial Cross which contains a wooden piece of the [[True Cross|Holy Cross]].\n\n==== Third Crusade ====\n* March &ndash; Frederick I leaves Adrianople to [[Gallipoli]] at the [[Dardanelles]] to embark, with the help of Byzantine transports, to cross into [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]]. On [[April 25]], he enters territory of the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rum]] under the rule of Sultan [[Kilij Arslan II]]. Although promised to let the German Crusaders pass peaceably through his domains, Kilij Arslan harasses Frederick's forces with hit-and-run attacks.

This period followed the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] in the [[Near East]], and the century saw the [[Early Iron Age]] take hold there. The [[Greek Dark Ages]] which had come about in 1200 BC continued. The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] is established towards the end of the 10th century BC. In the [[Iron Age in India]], the [[Vedic period]] is ongoing. In [[China]], the [[Zhou dynasty]] is in power. [[Bronze Age Europe]] continued with [[Urnfield culture]]. [[Japan]] was inhabited by an evolving [[hunter-gatherer]] society during the [[Jōmon period]].\n\n==The world in the 10th century BC==\n\n[[Image:East-Hem 1000bc.jpg|thumb|550px|centre|Map of the Eastern Hemisphere in 1000 BC.]]\n\n[[File:World_in_1000_BCE.png|thumb|centre|1000px|The world in 1000 BCE.]]\n\n==Events==\n[[Image:Psusennes I mask.jpg|thumb|right|Gold burial mask of [[Pharaoh]] [[Psusennes I]], discovered 1940 by [[Pierre Montet]].]]\n\n* [[1000 BC]]: [[India]]—[[Iron Age in India|Iron Age of India]].
