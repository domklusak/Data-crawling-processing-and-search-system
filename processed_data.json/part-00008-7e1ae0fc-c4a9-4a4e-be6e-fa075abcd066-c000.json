The form calculates the total taxable income of the taxpayer and determines how much is to be paid to or refunded by the government.\n\nIncome tax returns for individual calendar year taxpayers are due by [[Tax Day]], which is usually April 15 of the next year, except when April 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday. In those circumstances, the returns are due on the next business day. An automatic extension until October 15 to '''''file''''' Form 1040 can be obtained by filing Form 4868 (however, the filing does not extend the payment date if tax is owed; it must still be paid by Tax Day).\n\nForm 1040 consists of two pages (23 lines in total) not counting attachments.<ref name=\"f1040_2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf|title=Form 1040 (2018)|website=Internal Revenue Service|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190904160203/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf|archive-date=September 4, 2019|access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref> The first page collects information about the taxpayer(s) and dependents.

For instance, even if not required, individuals can file a return in order to receive a refund on withheld income or to receive certain credits (e.g. [[earned income tax credit]]).<ref name=\"f1040_2014ins\" />{{rp|6}}\n\n=== Filing modalities ===\n\nThe form may be filed either by paper or online.\n\n==== Paper filing ====\n\nPaper filing is the universally accepted filing method.

This way, it is easy to keep electronic copies of one's filled forms despite filing by paper. Alternatively, they can be printed out and filled by hand.

These attachments are usually called \"schedules\" because prior to the 1961, the related sections were schedules on the main form identified by letter. Form 1040 currently has 20 attachments, which may need to be filed depending on the taxpayer. For 2009 and 2010 there was an additional form, {{visible anchor|Schedule M}}, due to the \"[[Making Work Pay tax credit|Making Work Pay]]\" provision of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (\"the stimulus\").\n\nStarting in 2018, 1040 was \"simplified\" by separating out 6 new schedules numbers Schedule 1 through Schedule 6 to make parts of the main form optional. The new schedules had the prior old 1040 line numbers to make transition easier.\n\nIn addition to the listed schedules, there are dozens of other forms that may be required when filing a personal income tax return.

The short forms, Form 1040A and Form 1040EZ, also bear OMB control numbers.</ref> 2) As ruled in a number of cases, the absence of an OMB Control number does not eliminate the legal obligation to file or pay taxes.\n\nCases involving the OMB Control Number Argument include:\n*''United States v. Wunder''\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit argues that the provisions on the Paperwork Reduction Act are not relevant as the act applies only to information requests made after December 31, 1981, and tax returns starting from 1981 contained an OMB Control Number.<ref>919 F.2d 34, 90-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,575 (6th Cir. 1990).</ref>\n*''United States v. Patridge''\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the convicted taxpayer's OMB control number argument by stating \"Finally, we have no doubt that the IRS has complied with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Form 1040 bears a control number from OMB, as do the other forms the IRS commonly distributes to taxpayers. That this number has been constant since 1981 does not imply that OMB has shirked its duty.\"<ref name=\"Patridge\">''United States v. Patridge'', 507 F.3d 1092, 2007-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,806 (7th Cir. 2007), ''cert. denied'', 552 U.S. ___, 128 S. Ct. 1721 (2008).</ref>\n*''United States v. Lawrence''\nIn this Case, IRS agents who had calculated Lawrence's tax liability had made an error and it was discovered that Lawrence owed less taxes than originally determined. Lawrence asked the trial court to order the government to reimburse him for his legal fees, to which the trial court ruled against him. He appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, contending that the government's conduct against him had been \"vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith.\" and also raising the OMB Control Number Argument.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the OMB argument stating that\n \n<blockquote>According to Lawrence, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) required the Internal Revenue Service to display valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) numbers on its Form 1040…. Lawrence argues that the PRA by its terms prohibits the government from imposing a criminal penalty upon a citizen for the failure to complete a form where the information request at issue does not comply with the PRA... Yet Lawrence conceded at oral argument that no case from this circuit establishes such a proposition, and in fact Lawrence cites no caselaw from any jurisdiction that so holds. In contrast, the government referenced numerous cases supporting its position that the PRA does not present a defense to a criminal action for failure to file income taxes.\"<ref>Judgment, page 2, docket entry 39, March 26, 2007, ''United States v.

In other words, people with net incomes below $3,000 would have to pay no income tax at all.

The first high-earning tax bracket, $20,000–$50,000, has an additional tax of 1% on the part of net income above $20,000. Thus, somebody with a taxable income of $50,000 (over a million dollars in 2015 dollars according to the BLS)<ref name=inflation-calculator/> would pay a total of $800 (1% of $50,000 + 1% of $(50,000 − 20,000)) in federal income tax.

[[Formula Two]] had become too expensive, and was dominated by works-run cars with factory engines; the hope was that Formula 3000 would offer quicker, cheaper, more open racing. The series began as an open specification, then tyres were standardized from 1986 onwards, followed by engines and chassis in 1996. The series ran annually until 2004, and was replaced in 2005 by the [[GP2 Series]].\n\nThe series was staged as the Formula 3000 European Championship in 1985,<ref>1986 FIA Yearbook, Red section, page 82</ref> as the Formula 3000 Intercontinental Championship in 1986<ref>1987 FIA Yearbook, Red section, page 98</ref> and 1987<ref>1988 FIA Yearbook, Red section, page 97</ref> and then as the Formula 3000 International Championship from 1988<ref>Automobile Year 1988/89, pages 236-242</ref> to 2004.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041216021312/http://www.fia.com/sport/Championships/F3000/Classifications/2004.html 2004 FIA Formula 3000 International Championship Classifications] Retrieved from web.archive.org on 25 April 2010</ref>\n\n==Engines==\nFormula 3000 replaced Formula Two, and was so named because the engines used were limited to 3000cc maximum [[Engine displacement|capacity]]. Initially, the [[Cosworth DFV]] was a popular choice, having been made obsolete in Formula One by the adoption of 1.5 litre turbocharged engines. The rules permitted any 90-degree V8 engine, fitted with a rev-limiter to keep power output under control. As well as the Cosworth, a Honda engine based on an Indy V8 by [[Judd (engine)|John Judd]] also appeared; a rumoured [[Lamborghini]] V8 never raced. In later years, a [[Mugen-Honda]] V8 became the unit of choice, eclipsing the DFV; Cosworth responded with the brand new AC engine. Costs began to increase significantly.\n\n==Chassis==\n[[File:Fórmula 3000 (Fernado Alonso)01.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Fernando Alonso|Fernando Alonso's]] [[Lola Cars|Lola]] chassis in the [[2000 International Formula 3000 Championship|2000 season]].]]\nThe first chassis from [[March Engineering|March]], [[Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives]] (AGS) and [[Ralt]] were developments of their existing 1984 [[Formula Two]] designs, although [[Lola Cars|Lola]]'s entry was based on and looked very much like an [[Champ car|IndyCar]]. A few smaller teams tried obsolete three-litre [[Formula One]] cars (from [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]], [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]], [[Minardi]], [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] and RAM), with little success—the Grand Prix and Indycar-derived entries were too unwieldy as their fuel tanks were about twice the size of those needed for F3000 races, and the weight distribution was not ideal. The first few years of the championship saw March establishing a superiority over Ralt and Lola—there was little to choose between the chassis, but more Marches were sold and ended up in better hands. In 1988, the ambitious [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] marque entered with a brand new chassis; Reynard had won their first race in every formula they had previously entered, and did so again in F3000. The next couple of years saw Lola improve slightly—their car was competitive with the Reynard in 1990—and March slip, but both were crushed by the Reynard teams, and by the mid-90s, F3000 was a virtual Reynard monopoly, although [[Lola Cars|Lola]] did eventually return with a promising car and the Japanese [[Footwork (racing team)|Footwork]] and [[Dome (constructor)|Dome]] chassis were seen in Europe. [[Dallara]] briefly tried the series before moving up to [[Formula One]], and AGS moved up from Formula Two but never recaptured their occasional success. At least one unraced F3000 chassis existed—the Wagner fitted with a straight-six short-stroke BMW. This was converted into a sports car, however.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Politics==\nThe series saw occasional controversy. Definitive rules for the 1985 season did not appear until the championship was well under way. In 1987 questions were asked about the ability of some of the drivers, given the high number of accidents in the formula. In 1989 the eligibility of the new [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] chassis was challenged, as it was raced with a different nose to the one that had been crash tested.{{fact|date=July 2019}} This season also saw problems with driver changes - the cost of F3000 was escalating to the point that teams were finding it difficult to run drivers for a whole season. A rule limiting driver changes to two per car per season meant that some cars had to sit idle while drivers with budgets could not race them. In 1991, some Italian teams started using [[Agip]]'s so-called \"jungle juice\" [[Formula One]] fuel, worth an estimated 15&nbsp;bhp, giving their drivers a significant advantage. In the early years of the formula there was much concern about safety, with a high number of accidents resulting in injuries to drivers. There was one fatality in the International Championship - [[Marco Campos]] in the final round of the 1995 series.\n\n==Races==\nFormula 3000 races during the \"open chassis\" era tended to be of about 100–120 miles in distance, held at major circuits, either headlining meetings or paired with other international events. The \"jewel in the crown\" of the F3000 season was traditionally the [[Pau Grand Prix]] street race, rivalled for a few years by the [[Birmingham Superprix|Birmingham]] round. Most major circuits in France, [[Italy]], Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom saw the series visit at least once.\n\n==The spec-chassis years==\nIn 1996, new rules introduced a single engine (a detuned [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] V8 engine, re-engineered by and badged as a [[Zytek]]) and chassis ([[Lola Cars|Lola]]), to go along with tyre standardization ([[Avon Tyres|Avon]]) introduced in 1986. The following year the calendar was combined with that of Formula One, so the series became support races for the Grand Prix. Several Grand Prix teams established formal links with F3000 teams to develop young drivers (and engineering talent); these relationships varied from formal \"junior teams\" (such as the one [[McLaren]] set up for [[Nick Heidfeld]]) to fairly distant relationships based mostly upon shared sponsors and the use of the 'parent' team's name. The series grew dramatically through the late nineties, reaching an entry of nearly 40 cars - although this in itself was problematic as it meant many drivers failed to qualify. In 2000, the series was restricted to 15 teams of two cars each.\n\nHowever, by 2002 expenses were once more very high and the number of entries, and sponsors, rapidly dwindled. International Formula 3000 was experiencing tough competition with cheaper formulae, such as [[Auto GP|European F3000]] (using ex-FIA 1999 and 2002 Lola chassis), [[World Series by Nissan]] (also known as Formula Nissan) and [[Formula Renault V6 Eurocup]]. By the end of 2003, car counts had fallen to new lows.\n\nThe [[2004 International Formula 3000 Championship|2004 season]] was the last F3000 campaign, due in part to dwindling field sizes. In 2005 it was replaced with a new series known as [[GP2 Series|GP2]], with [[Renault]] backing.\n===Final year specifications===\n*'''Engine displacement''': [[Zytek]]-[[Judd (engine)|Judd]] ''KV'' F3000 {{convert|3.0|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<ref>{{cite web| url = https://juddpower.com/our-engines/judd-kv-zytek-v8-f3000/| title = JUDD KV V8 F3000 Zytek Racing Engine {{!}} Judd Power| date = 10 November 2016}}</ref>\n*'''Power output''': {{convert|450-520|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 8,750-10,500 rpm (11,000 rpm [[redline]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thevaultms.com/inventory/2003-lola-f3000-race-car/|title = 2003 Lola B02/00 Two-Seater}}</ref>\n*'''Torque output''': {{convert|300|lb.ft|N.m|0|abbr=on}}\n*'''Gearbox''': 6-speed [[Semi-automatic transmission|paddle-shift]] [[sequential gearbox]] (must have reverse)\n*'''Weight''': {{convert|545|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (including driver)\n*'''Fuel''': 102 RON unleaded\n*'''Fuel delivery''': Electronic-indirect [[fuel injection]]\n*'''Aspiration''': [[Naturally-aspirated engine|Naturally-aspirated]]\n*'''Width''': {{convert|1476|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n*'''Wheelbase''': {{convert|3000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n*'''Steering''': Non-assisted [[rack and pinion]]\n\n==Champions==\n{{further|List of International Formula 3000 drivers}}\n[[File:Bjorn Wirdheim 2003 F3000 Hungary.jpg|thumb|right|Sweden's [[Björn Wirdheim]] won the 2003 FIA Formula 3000 International Championship for Drivers]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Season\n!Champion Driver\n!Team\n!Car\n!Champion Team\n!Car\n|-\n!

It grew out of the \"Ford GT\" (for [[Grand tourer|Grand Touring]]) project, an effort to compete in European long-distance [[sports car racing|sports car races]], against [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], who had won the prestigious [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race [[List of 24 Hours of Le Mans winners|from 1960 to 1965]]. Ford succeeded with the GT40, winning the 1966 through 1969 races.\n\nThe effort began in the early 1960s when ''Ford Advanced Vehicles'' began to build the GT40 Mk I car, based upon the [[Lola Mk6]], at their base in [[Slough]], UK. After disappointing race results, the engineering team was moved in 1964 to [[Dearborn, Michigan]], USA to design and build cars by ''Kar Kraft''. All chassis versions were powered by a series of American-built [[Ford V8]] engines modified for racing.\n\nIn [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans|1966]], Ford with the GT40 Mk II car broke Ferrari's winning streak at Le Mans, thus becoming the first American manufacturer to have won a major European race since [[Jimmy Murphy (racing driver)|Jimmy Murphy]]'s triumph with [[Duesenberg]] at the [[1921 French Grand Prix]].<ref>{{cite web|date=2004-03-01|title=Ford GT40 Mark II|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/692.html|access-date=2010-09-24|publisher=Supercars.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2006-12-21|title=1965 - 1966 Ford GT40 Mk II - Images, Specifications and Information|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1089/Ford-GT40-Mk-II.html|access-date=2011-08-09|publisher=Ultimatecarpage.com}}</ref><ref name=Sauber>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.lemans.org/explorer/pdf/courses/2018/24-heures-du-mans/press-kit/fr/statistiques-historiques-fr.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627144353/https://assets.lemans.org/explorer/pdf/courses/2018/24-heures-du-mans/press-kit/fr/statistiques-historiques-fr.pdf |archive-date=2018-06-27 |url-status=live|title=The ACO statistics of winners}}</ref> In [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|1967]], the Mk IV car became the only car designed and built entirely (both chassis and engine) in the United States to achieve the overall win at Le Mans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://simeonemuseum.org/the-cars|title=The Collection|work=simeonemuseum.org|date=23 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Mk I, the oldest of the cars, won in [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]] and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]], the second chassis to win Le Mans more than once.

Its American Ford V8 engine, originally of 4.7-liter displacement capacity ([[Ford Windsor engine#289 HiPo (K-code)|289]] cubic inches), was enlarged to 4.9 litres ([[Ford Windsor engine#302|302]] cubic inches), with custom alloy [[Dan Gurney|Gurney]]–[[Weslake]] [[cylinder head]]s.\n\nThe \"40\" represented its height of 40&nbsp;inches (1.02 m), measured at the windscreen, the minimum allowed. The first 12 \"prototype\" vehicles carried serial numbers GT-101 to GT-112. Once \"production\" began, the Mk I, Mk II, Mk III, and Mk IV were numbered GT40P/1000 through GT40P/1145, and thus officially \"GT40s\". The Mk IVs were numbered J1-J12.\n\nThe contemporary [[Ford GT]] is a modern homage to the GT40.\n\n== History ==\n[[Henry Ford II]] had wanted a Ford at Le Mans since the early 1960s. In early 1963, Ford reportedly received word through a European intermediary that [[Enzo Ferrari]] was interested in selling to Ford Motor Company. Ford reportedly spent several million dollars in an audit of Ferrari factory assets and in legal negotiations, only to have Ferrari unilaterally cut off talks at a late stage due to disputes about the ability to direct open-wheel racing. Ferrari, who wanted to remain the sole operator of his company's motorsports division, was angered when he was told that he would not be allowed to race at the [[Indianapolis 500]] if the deal went through, since Ford fielded Indy cars using its own engine and didn't want competition from Ferrari. Enzo cut the deal off out of spite and Henry Ford II, enraged, directed his racing division to find a company that could build a Ferrari-beater on the world endurance-racing circuit.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ford GT40.|last=Ray.|first=Hutton|isbn=978-1907085680|page=12|oclc=1019613496|date = 6 February 2018|publisher=Porter Press }}</ref>\n\nTo this end, Ford began negotiation with [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]], [[Lola Cars|Lola]], and [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]].

It was one of the most advanced racing cars of the time and made a noted performance in Le Mans 1963, even though the car did not finish, due to low gearing and slow revving out on the [[Mulsanne Straight]]. However, [[Eric Broadley]], Lola Cars' owner and chief designer, agreed on a short-term personal contribution to the project without involving Lola Cars.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jO8Ad4W-JQ8C&q=Eric+Broadley+ford+gt&pg=PA17|title=Ford GT: Then, and Now|last=Streather|first=Adrian|date=2006|publisher=Veloce Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781845840549|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe agreement with Broadley included a one-year collaboration between Ford and Broadley, and the sale of the two Lola Mk 6 chassis builds to Ford. To form the development team, Ford also hired the ex-[[Aston Martin]] team manager [[John Wyer]].<ref name=scm201211>{{cite journal|last=Comer|first=Colin|title=1968 Ford GT40 Gulf/Mirage Lightweight|journal=[[Sports Car Market]]|date=November 2012|volume=24|issue=11|pages=46–47}}</ref> Ford Motor Co. engineer [[Roy Lunn]] was sent to England; he had designed the mid-engined [[Ford Mustang I|Mustang I]] concept car powered by a 1.7-liter V4. Despite the small engine of the Mustang I, Lunn was the only Dearborn engineer to have some experience with a mid-engined car.\n\nOverseen by [[Harley Copp]], the team of Broadley, Lunn, and Wyer began working on the new car at the Lola Factory in Bromley. At the end of 1963, the team moved to [[Slough]], near [[Heathrow Airport]]. Ford then established [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] Advanced Vehicles (FAV) Ltd, a new subsidiary under the direction of Wyer, to manage the project.<ref name=scm201211/>\n\nThe first chassis built by [[Abbey Panels]] of Coventry was delivered on 16 March 1964, with fibreglass mouldings produced by Fibre Glass Engineering Ltd of [[Farnham]].

Three weeks later at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], all three entries retired, although the Ginther/Gregory car led the field from the second lap until its first pitstop. After a season-long series of dismal results under John Wyer in 1964, the program was handed over to [[Carroll Shelby]] after the [[Bahamas Speed Week|1964 Nassau race]]. The cars were sent directly to Shelby, still bearing the dirt and damage from the Nassau race. Carroll Shelby was noted for complaining that the cars were poorly maintained when he received them, but later information revealed the cars were packed up as soon as the race was over, and FAV never had a chance to clean and organize the cars to be transported to Shelby.\n\nShelby's first victory came on their maiden race with the Ford program, with [[Ken Miles]] and [[Lloyd Ruby]] taking a Shelby American-entered Ford GT40<ref>[http://www.racingsportscars.com/covers/_Daytona-1965-02-28e.jpg ''Entries for the fourth annual Daytona Continental'', 1965 Daytona Speedweeks Program No 2, 15–28 February 1965, www.racingsportscars.com] Retrieved 7 June 2015</ref> to victory in the [[24 Hours of Daytona#2000 km distance|Daytona 2000km]] in February 1965. One month later, Ken Miles and [[Bruce McLaren]] came in second overall (to the winning [[Chaparral Cars|Chaparral]] in the sports class) and first in prototype class at the Sebring 12-hour race. The rest of the season, however, was a disappointment.\n\n[[File:1965 Ford GT40 Mark I at Greenwich, front right 1.jpg|thumb|right|Ford GT40 Mk I road version (chassis P/1030)]]\n\nThe experience gained in 1964 and 1965 allowed the 7-liter Mk II to dominate the following year. In February, the GT40 again won at Daytona. This was the first year [[24 Hours of Daytona#24 Hour duration (1966–1971)|Daytona was run in the 24 Hour format]] and Mk II's finished 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. In March, at the [[1966 12 Hours of Sebring]], GT40s again took all three top finishes, with the X-1 Roadster first, a Mk II taking second, and a Mk I in third. Then in June, at the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]], the GT40 achieved yet another 1–2–3 result.\n\nThe Le Mans finish, however, was clouded in controversy: The No1 car of Ken Miles and [[Denny Hulme]] held a four lap lead over the No2 car of Bruce McLaren and [[Chris Amon]]. This disintegrated when the No1 car was forced to make a pit-stop for replacement brake rotors, following an incorrect set being fitted a lap prior in a scheduled rotor change. It was found to be a result of the correct brake rotors being taken by the No2 crew.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Considine |first1=Tim |title=Foul play in Ford's 1966 le Mans 24 Hour photo finish?

With a multimillion-dollar program finally on the very brink of success, Ford team officials faced a difficult choice. They could allow the drivers to settle the outcome by racing each other—and risk one or both cars breaking down or crashing; they could dictate a finishing order to the drivers—guaranteeing that one set of drivers would be extremely unhappy; or they could arrange a tie, with the McLaren/Amon and Miles/Hulme cars crossing the line side by side.\n\nThe team chose the latter and informed Shelby. He told McLaren and Miles of the decision just before the two got into their cars for the final stint. Then, not long before the finish, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), organizers of the Le Mans event, informed Ford that the geographical difference in starting positions would be taken into account at a close finish. This meant that the McLaren/Amon vehicle, which had started perhaps {{convert|60|ft|m}} behind the Hulme-Miles car, would have covered slightly more ground over the 24 hours and would, in the event of a tie for first place, be the winner. Secondly, Ford officials admitted later, the company's contentious relationship with Miles, its top contract driver, placed executives in a difficult position. They could reward an outstanding driver who had been at times extremely difficult to work with, or they could decide in favor of drivers (McLaren/Amon) who had committed less to the Ford program but who had been easier to deal with. Ford stuck with the orchestrated photo finish. What happened on the last lap remains the subject of speculation. Either Miles, deeply bitter over this decision after his dedication to the program, issued his own protest by suddenly slowing just yards from the finish and letting McLaren across the line first, or McLaren accelerated just before the finish line robbing Miles of his victory. Either way, McLaren was declared the victor.\n\nTwo months later Ken Miles died at the wheel of the Ford \"J-car\", in a testing accident at [[Riverside Raceway]]. The J-car was a GT40 prototype that included several unique features, most notably an aluminium-honeycomb chassis-construction and a \"bread-van\" body-design that experimented with \"[[Kammback]]\" aerodynamic theories. Miles' fatal accident was attributed at least partly to the unproven aerodynamics of the J-car design, and to the experimental chassis' strength. The team embarked on a complete redesign of the car, which became known as the Mk&nbsp;IV. The Mk&nbsp;IV newer design, with a Mk&nbsp;II engine but a different chassis and a different body, won [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|the following year at Le Mans]] (when four Mark&nbsp;IVs, three Mark&nbsp;IIs, and three Mark&nbsp;Is raced). The high speeds achieved in that race caused a rule change, which already came into effect in 1968: the prototypes were limited to the capacity of 3.0 litres, the same as in [[Formula One]]. This took out the V12-powered [[Ferrari P#330 P4|Ferrari 330P]], the Chaparral, [[Jaguar XJ13]] and the Mk&nbsp;IV.\n\n[[File:Ford GT40 (39430889701).jpg|thumb|300px|Replica of a Ford GT40 with ''#9'' from [[Pedro Rodríguez (racing driver)|Rodríguez]] and [[Lucien Bianchi|Bianchi]] winners of the [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans]].]]\n\nIf at least 50 cars had been built, sportscars like the GT40 and the [[Lola T70]] were allowed, with a maximum of 5.0&nbsp;l. [[John Wyer]]'s revised 4.7-liter (bored to 4.9 litre, and [[O-ring]]s cut and installed between the [[Cylinder block|block]] and [[Cylinder head|head]] to prevent [[head gasket]] failure, a common problem found with the 4.7 engine) Mk I won the [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 hours of Le Mans race in 1968]] against the fragile smaller prototypes. This result, added to four other round wins for the GT40, gave Ford victory in the [[1968 World Sportscar Championship|1968 International Championship for Makes]]. The GT40's intended 3.0&nbsp;l replacement, the [[Ford P68]], and Mirage cars proved a dismal failure. While facing more experienced prototypes and the new yet still unreliable 4.5&nbsp;l [[Flat-12 engine|flat-12]]-powered [[Porsche 917]]s, Wyer's [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans]] winners [[Jacky Ickx]]/[[Jackie Oliver]] managed to beat the remaining 3.0-liter [[Porsche 908]] by just a few seconds with the already outdated GT40 Mk&nbsp;I, in the very car that had won in 1968 – the legendary GT40P/1075. Apart from brake-wear in the Porsche and the decision not to change brake-pads so close to the end of the race, the winning combination was relaxed driving by both GT40 drivers and heroic efforts at the right time by (at that time Le Mans' rookie) Ickx, who would go on to win Le Mans five more times in later years.\n\n=== Le Mans 24 Hours victories ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:skyBlue; text-align:center; border-bottom:3px solid;\"|[[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans 24 Hours]] victories\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Year || rowspan=\"2\" |Car || rowspan=\"2\" |Team || rowspan=\"2\" |Drivers || rowspan=\"2\" |Engine || rowspan=\"2\" |Tyre || rowspan=\"2\" |Distance<br />in km || colspan=\"2\"|Speed\n|-\n| mph || km/h\n|-\n| [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans|1966]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportscars.tv/Newfiles/66entrylist.html|title=1966 24 Hours of Le Mans Entry list}}</ref> || GT40P/1046 (Mk&nbsp;II) || {{Flagicon|United States}} [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American Inc.]] || {{flagicon|NZL}} [[Bruce McLaren]]<br />{{flagicon|NZL}} [[Chris Amon]] || [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] 7.0L V8 || {{Goodyear}} || 4843.09 ||125.39\n| 201.80\n|-\n| [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|1967]] || J5 (Mk&nbsp;IV) || {{Flagicon|United States}} [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American Inc.]] || {{Flagicon|United States}} [[Dan Gurney]]<br />{{Flagicon|United States}} [[A.

The first success came after their demise at the Nassau Speed Weekend Nov 1964 when the racing was handed over to Carrol Shelby. Shelby's team modified the Ford GT40 and the first win at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] February 1965 was achieved. Much was later modified and run by [[John Wyer]] in 1968 and 1969, winning Le Mans in both those years and [[Sebring International Raceway|Sebring]] in 1969. The Mk II and IV were both obsolete after the [[FIA]] had changed the rules to ban unlimited capacity engines, ruling out the 427 cu in (7 L) Ford V8. However, the Mk I, with its smaller engine, was legally able to race as a [[homologated]] sports car because of its production numbers.\n\nIn 1968 competition came from the [[Porsche 908]] which was the first prototype built for the 3-liter Group 6. The result of the 1968 was resounding success at the [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] with [[Pedro Rodríguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodríguez]] and [[Lucien Bianchi]] having a clear lead over the Porsches, driving the ‘almighty’ #9 car with the '[[Gulf Oil]]' colors.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://primotipo.com/tag/ford-gt40-1076/\n|title=Posts Tagged 'Ford GT40 '1076''\n|website=Primotipo.com\n|editor=GP Library\n|first=Rainer\n|last=Schlegelmilch\n|date=May 9, 2016\n|access-date=2018-09-08}}</ref> The season began slowly for JW, losing at Sebring and Daytona before taking their first win at the BOAC International 500 at Brands Hatch.

The car had an aluminium chassis built at Abbey Panels and was originally powered by a 289 cu in (4.7L) engine. The real purpose of this car was to test several improvements originating from Kar Kraft, Shelby, and McLaren. Several gearboxes were used: a [[Hewland]] LG500 and at least one automatic gearbox. It was later upgraded to Mk II specifications with a 427 cu in (7 L) engine and a standard four ratio Kar Kraft (subsidiary of Ford) gearbox, however, the car kept specific features such as its open roof and lightweight aluminium chassis. The car went on to win the [[1966 12 Hours of Sebring|12 Hours of Sebring]] in 1966. The X-1 was a one-off and, having been built in the United Kingdom and being liable for United States [[tariff]]s, was later ordered to be destroyed by United States customs officials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/2492.html|title=Ford GT40 X1|work=supercars.net|date=20 April 2016 }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Mk II ===\n[[File:Ford GT40 (rear).jpg|thumb|left|Ford GT40 Mk II rear]]\nThe Mk II was rebuilt separately by both Holman Moody and Shelby American to handle the [[Ford FE engine|7.0-liter FE (427 ci)]] engine from the [[Ford Galaxie]], used in NASCAR at the time and modified for road course use.

This would result in the abandonment of the original Mk I/Mk II chassis.\n\nIn order to bring the car into alignment with Ford's \"in house\" ideology at the time, more restrictive partnerships were implemented with English firms, which resulted in the sale of Ford Advanced Vehicles (acquired by [[John Wyer]]), ultimately leading to a new vehicle which would be slated for design by Ford's studios and produced by Ford's subsidiary Kar-Kraft under [[Ed Hull]]. Furthermore, there was also a partnership with the [[Brunswick Aircraft Corporation]] for expertise on the novel use of [[aluminium]] honeycomb panels bonded together to form a lightweight, rigid \"tub\".\n\nThe car was designated as the J-car, as it was constructed to meet the new Appendix J regulations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/3406/Ford-Mk-IV.html|title=Ford Mk IV|access-date=22 February 2010}}</ref>\nwhich were introduced by the FIA in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/resources/documents/2102817986__Hist_App_J_69_Art_252_a.pdf|title=Appendix J to the International Sporting Code|access-date=23 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050302205843/http://www.fia.com/resources/documents/2102817986__Hist_App_J_69_Art_252_a.pdf|archive-date=2 March 2005|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe first J-car was completed in March 1966 and set the fastest time at the Le Mans trials that year.

Excluding the engine, gearbox, some suspension parts and the brakes from the Mk II, the Mk IV was totally different from other GT40s, using a specific, all-new chassis and bodywork. It was undoubtedly the most radical and American variant of all the GT40s over the years. As a direct result of the Miles accident, the team installed a NASCAR-style steel-tube roll cage in the Mk IV, which made it much safer, but the roll cage was so heavy that it negated most of the weight saving of the then-highly advanced, radically innovative honeycomb-panel construction. The Mk IV had a long, streamlined shape, which gave it exceptional top speed, crucial to do well at Le Mans in those days (a circuit made up predominantly of straight roads connecting tight corners)—the race it was ultimately built for. A 2-speed automatic gearbox was tried, but during the extensive testing of the J-car in 1966 and 1967, it was decided that the 4-speed from the Mk II would be retained. \n\nThe car proved to be fastest in a straight line that year, thanks to its streamlined aerodynamics, achieving 212&nbsp;mph on the 3.6-mile [[Mulsanne Straight]]. \n\nDan Gurney, who was 6 feet 4 inches tall, requested a bubble-shaped piece of spherical bodywork extension over the top of the driver's seat so that he could fit into the car. Gurney also complained about the weight of the Mk IV, since the car was {{convert|600|lb}} heavier than the Ferrari 330 P4, which, combined with the higher speed, put more stress on the Ford brakes. During practice at Le Mans in 1967, in an effort to preserve the brakes, Gurney developed a strategy (also adopted by co-driver [[A.J. Foyt]] who had just won the [[1967 Indianapolis 500]]) of backing completely off the throttle several hundred yards before the approach to the Mulsanne hairpin and virtually coasting into the braking area. This technique saved the brakes, but the resulting increase in the car's recorded lap times during practice led to speculation within the Ford team that Gurney and Foyt, in an effort to compromise on chassis settings, had hopelessly \"dialed out\" their car - despite Gurney having been the fastest GT40 pilot in the 1966 practice and race. Also, Gurney was developing his own Eagle V12 F1 car with which he would win the [[1967 Belgian Grand Prix]] the very next weekend. \n\nFord's R&D department in Detroit had built a test rig that simulated whatever circuit the rig's computer was programmed to simulate; the Mk IV was put on this test rig and was subjected to weeks and weeks of testing on a simulated Le Mans lap. The rig was programmed to know every detail of the programmed circuit- every bump, every contour, every gear change, every corner and every length of straight on the Le Mans circuit, so that the engineers running these tests would know exactly how to build and prepare every component of the car for Le Mans. These kinds of test rigs are commonly used today by Formula One and factory Le Mans prototype teams; however this kind of incredibly advanced technology for the time, which was developed throughout 1966 and early 1967 was unheard of.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}\n\nThe Mk IV ran in only two races, the [[1967 12 Hours of Sebring]] and the [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans]], and won both events. Only one Mk IV was completed for Sebring; the pressure from Ford had been amped up considerably after Ford's humiliation at Daytona two months earlier. [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Bruce McLaren]] won Sebring, [[Dan Gurney]] and [[A. J. Foyt]] won Le Mans (Gurney and Foyt's car was the Mk IV that was apparently least likely to win), where the Ford-representing Shelby-American and Holman & Moody teams showed up to Le Mans with 2 Mk IVs each.<ref name=\"supercars.net\" /> The installation of the roll cage was ultimately credited by many with saving the life of Andretti, who crashed violently at the Esses during the 1967 Le Mans 24 Hours, but escaped with minor injuries. Gurney later described the Mk IV as \"''half-way between a road-legal passenger car and a race car; it was reliable and comfortable, but heavy''\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6Kj3n-NDt0 | title='Behind the Headlights' the story of the Ford GT40 | website=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>\n\nUnlike the earlier Mk I - III cars, the chassis of which were built in Britain, the Mk IV car was built entirely in the United States by Kar Kraft, Ford's performance division in [[Detroit]]. Thus, Le Mans 1967 still remains both the only all-American victory in Le Mans history — American drivers ([[Dan Gurney]] and [[A. J. Foyt]]), team ([[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American Inc.]]), chassis constructor ([[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]), engine manufacturer (Ford), and tyres ([[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]) — as well as the only victory of a car designed and built entirely (both chassis and engine) in the United States. A total of six Mk IVs were constructed.<ref name=isr /> \n\nOne of the Mk IVs was rebuilt to [[Group 7 (motorsport)]] rules as the [[Ford G7]] in 1968, and used in the [[Can-Am]] series for 1969 and 1970, but with no success. This car is sometimes called the ''Ford Mk IV''.<ref name=isr />\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mk V and John Wyer's modified Mk I's===\nFor years Peter Thorp had searched for a GT40 in good condition. Most of the cars had problems including the dreaded rust issue. His company, Safir Engineering, was building and fielding [[Formula 3]] race cars, in addition, had a Token Formula One car purchased from the [[Ron Dennis]] Company, Rondell Racing. Formula One events in which Safir Engineering competed included [[Brands Hatch]] and [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. Safir was also redesigning [[Range Rover]]s modifying the unit to six-wheel drive and exporting them. Safir technical capabilities were such that they could rebuild GT40s. It was with this in mind that Thorp approached John Willment for his thoughts. It was soon decided that there would be a limited, further run of the significant GT40. JW Engineering would oversee the build, and Safir was to do the work. The continued JW Engineering/Safir Engineering production would utilize sequential serial numbers starting at the last used GT40 serial number and move forward. Maintaining the GT40 Mark nomenclature, this continued production would be named GT40 Mk V.\n\nJW Engineering wished to complete the GT40 chassis numbers GT40P-1087, 1088 and 1089. This was supposed to take place prior to the beginning of Safir production, however, the completion of these three chassis’ was very much delayed.\n\nFord's Len Bailey was hired to inspect the proposed build and engineer any changes he thought prudent to ensure the car was safe, as well as minimize problems experienced in the past. Baily changed the front suspension to [[Alan Mann Racing|Alan Mann]] specifications, which minimized nose-dive under braking. Zinc coated steel replaced the previous uncoated rust-prone sheet metal. The vulnerable drive donuts were replaced with CV joints and the leak-prone rubber gas tanks were replaced with aluminium tanks. The GT40 chassis was upgraded without making any major changes.\n\nTennant Panels supplied the roof structure and the balance of the chassis was completed by Safir. Bill Pink, noted for his electrical experience and the wiring installation of previous GT40s, was brought in. Also, Jim Rose was hired for his experience with working at both Alan Mann and Shelby. After the manufacture of chassis 1120, John Etheridge was hired to manage the GT40 build. The chassis was supplied from Adams McCall Engineering and parts supplied from Tennant panels.\n\nFor the most part, the Mk V resembled very closely the Mk I car, although there were a few changes, and, as with the '60s production, very few cars were identical.\n\nThe first car, GT40P-1090, had an open-top in place of roofed doors. Most motors were Ford small block, Webers or 4 Barrel Carburettor. Safir produced five Big Block GT40s, serial numbers GT40P-1128 to GT40P-1132. These aluminium big block cars all had easily removable door roof sections. Most GT40s were high-performance street cars however some of the Mk V production can be described as full race. Two road cars GT40P-1133 (roadster) and GT40P-1142 (roofed doors) were built as lightweights which included an aluminium honeycomb chassis and carbon fiber bodywork.\n\n=== Continuation models, replicas and modernizations ===\n[[File:Ford GT40 P-2090 at Road America.jpg|thumb|right| GT40/R Competition at [[Road America]] ]]\n[[File:1965 Ford GT40.jpg|thumb|right|A \"Roaring Forties\" replica of a 1965 Ford GT40 in Shelby livery on display at the [[2005 United States Grand Prix]]]]\nSeveral [[kit car]]s and replicas inspired by the Ford GT40 have been built. They are generally intended for assembly in a home workshop or garage.

Three production prototype cars were shown in 2003 as part of Ford's centenary, and delivery of the production Ford GT began in the fall of 2004. The Ford GT was assembled in the Ford Wixom plant and painted by [[Saleen|Saleen, Incorporated]] at their [[Saleen Special Vehicles]] plant in [[Troy, Michigan]].\n\nA British company, [[Safir Engineering]], who continued to produce a limited number of GT40s (the '''Mk V''') in the 1980s under an agreement with Walter Hayes of Ford and John Wilmont of J.W. Automotive Engineering, owned the GT40 trademark at that time, and when they completed production, they sold the excess parts, tooling, design, and trademark to a small American company called '''Safir GT40 Spares, Limited''' based in [[Ohio]]. Safir GT40 Spares licensed the use of the GT40 trademark to Ford for the initial 2002 show car, but when Ford decided to make the production vehicle, negotiations between the two failed, and as a result, the new Ford GT does not wear the badge GT40. Bob Wood, one of three partners who own Safir GT40 Spares, said: \"When we talked with Ford, they asked what we wanted. We said that Ford owns Beanstalk in New York, the company that licenses the Blue Oval for Ford on such things as T-shirts. Since Beanstalk gets 7.5 percent of the retail cost of the item for licensing the name, we suggested 7.5 percent on each GT40 sold.\"<ref name=\"Nixed\">{{Cite news|title=A GT by any other name is nixed by Ford|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|location=Chicago|date=31 October 2003|first=Jim|last=Mateja|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-119462642.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100216/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-119462642.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 September 2015|access-date=23 June 2014}} </ref> In this instance, Ford wished to purchase, not just license the GT40 trademark.

Discussions between Safir and Ford ensued. However, in fact, the Ford Motor Company never made an offer in writing to purchase the famed GT40 trademark. Later models or prototypes have also been called the Ford GT but have had different numbering on them such as the Ford GT90 or the Ford GT70. The GT40 name and trademark is currently licensed to Superformance in the USA.\n\nA second-generation Ford GT was unveiled at the 2015 [[North American International Auto Show]]. It features a 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 engine, carbonfibre monocoque and body panels, pushrod suspension and active aerodynamics.

It was also planned to dock with the ATV from the Gemini 8 mission.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1966-066A|title=Gemini 10|publisher=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=January 6, 2018}}</ref> This Agena's battery power had failed months earlier, and an approach and docking would demonstrate the ability to rendezvous with a passive object. It would be also the first mission to fire the Agena's own rocket, allowing them to reach higher orbits.\n\nGemini 10 established that radiation at high altitude was not a problem. After docking with their [[Agena target vehicle|Agena]] booster in low orbit, Young and Collins used it to climb temporarily to {{convert|763.8|km|nmi|order=flip}}. After leaving the first Agena, they then rendezvoused with the derelict Agena left over from the aborted [[Gemini 8]] flight—thus executing the program's first double rendezvous. With no electricity on board the second Agena, the rendezvous was accomplished with eyes only—no radar.\n[[File:Gemini 10 launch.jpg|thumb|Launch of Gemini 10 mission]]\nAfter the rendezvous, Collins spacewalked over to the dormant Agena at the end of a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} tether, making him the first person to meet another spacecraft in orbit. Collins then retrieved a cosmic dust-collecting panel from the side of the Agena. As he was concentrating on keeping his tether clear of the Gemini and Agena, Collins' Hasselblad camera worked itself free and drifted away, so he was unable to take photographs during the spacewalk.\n\n==Flight==\nThe Agena launched perfectly for the second time, after problems had occurred with the targets for Gemini 6 and 9. Gemini 10 followed 100 minutes later and entered a {{convert|159.9|by|268.9|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|order=flip}} orbit. They were {{convert|1800|km|nmi|sp=us|order=flip}} behind the Agena. Two anomalous events occurred during the launch. At liftoff, a propellant fill umbilical became snared with its release lanyard. It ripped out of the LC-19 service tower and remained attached to the second stage during ascent. Tracking camera footage also showed that the first stage oxidizer tank dome ruptured after staging and released a cloud of [[nitrogen tetroxide]]. The telemetry package on the first stage had been disabled at staging, so visual evidence was the only data available. Film review of the Titan II ICBM launches found at least seven other instances of post-staging tank ruptures, most likely caused by flying debris, second stage engine exhaust, or structural bending. NASA finally decided that this phenomenon did not pose any safety risk to the astronauts and took no corrective action.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Gemini 10\n! scope=\"col\" | Agena Info\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Agena\n| GATV-5005\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | NSSDC ID:\n| 1966-065A\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mass\n| {{convert|3,175|kg|lb|order=flip}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch site\n| LC-14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch date\n| July 18, 1966\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch time\n| 20:39:46 UTC\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st perigee\n| {{convert|294.7|km|nmi|order=flip}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st apogee\n| {{convert|302.8|km|nmi|order=flip}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Period\n| 90.46 m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inclination\n| 28.85\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Reentered\n| December 29, 1966\n|}\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===First rendezvous===\nCollins was unable to use the sextant for navigation as it did not seem to work as expected. At first he mistook airglow as the real horizon when trying to make some fixes on stars. When the image didn't seem right he tried another instrument, but this was not practical to use as it had a very small field of view.\n\nThey had a backup in the form of the computers on the ground. They made their first burn to put them into a {{convert|265|by|272|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|order=flip}} orbit. However Young didn't realize that during the next burn, he had the spacecraft turned slightly, which meant that they introduced an out-of-plane error. This meant two extra burns were necessary, and by the time they had docked with the Agena, 60% of their fuel had been consumed. It was decided to keep the Gemini docked to the Agena as long as possible, as this would mean that they could use the fuel on board the Agena for attitude control.\n\nThe first burn of the Agena engine lasted 80 seconds and put them in a {{convert|294|by|763|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|order=flip}} orbit. This was the highest a person had ever been, although the record was soon surpassed by [[Gemini 11]], which went to over {{convert|1000|km|nmi|sp=us|order=flip}}. This burn was quite a ride for the crew. Because the Gemini and Agena docked nose-to-nose, the forces experienced were \"eyeballs out\" as opposed to \"eyeballs in\" for a launch from Earth. The crew took a couple of pictures when they reached [[apogee]] but were more interested in what was going on in the spacecraft &mdash; checking the systems and watching the radiation dosage meter.\n\nAfter this they had their sleep period which lasted for eight hours and then they were ready for another busy day. The crew's first order of business was to make a second burn with the Agena engine to put them into the same orbit as the Gemini 8 Agena. This was at 20:58 UTC on July 19 and lasted 78 seconds and took {{convert|105|m/s|ft/s|sp=us|order=flip}} off their speed, putting them into a {{convert|294|by|382|km|nmi|adj=on|sp=us|order=flip}} orbit. They made one more burn of the Agena to circularize their orbit to {{convert|377.6|km|nmi|sp=us|order=flip}}.\n\n===EVA 1===\nThe first of two EVAs on Gemini 10 was a standup EVA, where Collins would stand in the open hatch and take photographs of stars as part of experiment S-13. They used a 70&nbsp;mm general purpose camera to image the southern [[Milky Way Galaxy|Milky Way]] in ultraviolet. After orbital sunrise Collins photographed a color plate on the side of the spacecraft (MSC-8) to see whether film reproduced colors accurately in space. He reentered the spacecraft six minutes early when both astronauts found that their eyes were irritated, which was caused by a minor leak of [[lithium hydroxide]] in the astronauts' oxygen supply.<ref name=collins>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Michael|title=Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys|date=1974|publisher=Cooper Square Press|isbn=9781461660880|type=ebook|chapter=8}}</ref>  After repressurizing the cabin, they ran the oxygen at high rates and flushed the environment system.\n\nAfter the exercise of the EVA Young and Collins slept in their second 'night' in space. The next 'morning' they started preparing for the second rendezvous and another EVA.\n\n===Second rendezvous===\nAfter undocking from their Agena, the crew thought they sighted the Gemini 8 Agena. It however turned out to be their own Agena {{convert|5.5|km|nmi|sp=us|order=flip}} away, while their target was {{convert|176|km|nmi|sp=us|order=flip}} away. It wasn't until just over {{convert|30|km|nmi|order=flip}} away that they saw it as a faint star. After a few more correction burns, they were station-keeping {{convert|10|ft|m|sp=us}} away from the Gemini 8 Agena. They found the Agena to be very stable and in good condition.\n\n===EVA 2===\nAt 48 hours and 41 minutes into the mission, the second EVA began. Collins' first task was to retrieve a Micrometeorite Collector (S-12) from the side of the spacecraft. This he accomplished with some difficulty (similar to that encountered by [[Eugene Cernan]] on [[Gemini 9A]]). The collector floated out of the cabin at some time during the EVA, and was lost.\n\nCollins next traveled over to the Agena and tried to grab onto the docking cone but found this impossible as it was smooth and had no grip. He used a [[nitrogen]]-propelled [[Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit]] (HHMU) to move himself towards the Gemini and then back to the Agena. This time he was able to grab hold of some wire bundles and retrieved the Micrometeorite Collector (S-10) from the Agena. He decided against replacing it as a piece of shroud had come loose on the Agena which could have snared the umbilical, and returning to the Gemini was deemed the safest course of action.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/mission_trans/GT10_TEC.PDF#page=251 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816203735/https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/mission_trans/GT10_TEC.PDF |archive-date=2019-08-16 |url-status=live|title=Gemini X Composite Air-to-Ground and Onboard Voice Tape Transcription, 338 pages|access-date=2 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe last tasks remaining on this EVA were to test out the HHMU, test orbital mechanics using a tether between the Gemini and Agena, and for Young in the spacecraft to translate over to a passive Collins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/GT10_PAO.PDF#page=387 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021126090708/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/GT10_PAO.PDF |archive-date=2002-11-26 |url-status=live|title=Gemini X PAO Mission Commentary Transcript, 524 pages|access-date=2 January 2019}}</ref> However, due to low propellant quantity remaining, combined with intermittent telemetry to monitor it, these fuel costly manoeuvres were abandoned and the EVA was finished after only 39 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/GT10_PAO.PDF#page=386 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021126090708/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/GT10_PAO.PDF |archive-date=2002-11-26 |url-status=live|title=Gemini X PAO Mission Commentary Transcript, 524 pages|access-date=2 January 2019}}</ref> During this time, it took the crew eight minutes to close the hatch as they had some difficulty with the {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} umbilical. It was jettisoned along with the chestpack used by Collins an hour later when they opened the hatch for the third and final time.\n\n===Experiments===\nThere were ten other experiments that the crew performed during the mission. Three were interested in radiation: MSC-3 was the Tri-Axis Magnetometer which measured levels in the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]]. There was also MSC-6, a [[Beta particle|beta]] [[spectrometer]], which measured potential radiation doses for Apollo missions, and MSC-7, a [[bremsstrahlung]] spectrometer which detected [[radiation flux]] as a function of energy when the spacecraft passed through the South Atlantic Anomaly.\n\nS-26 investigated the ion and electron wake of the spacecraft. This provided limited results due to the lack of fuel for attitude control, but found that electron and ion temperatures were higher than expected and it registered shock effects during docking and undocking.\n\nThe S-5 and S-6 experiments were performed, which were previously carried on Gemini 9A; these were Synoptic Terrain and Synoptic Weather photography respectively. There was also S-1 which was intended to image the [[Zodiacal light]]. All of these experiments were of little use as the film used was only half as sensitive as Gemini 9A and the dirty windows lowered the transmission of light by a factor of six.\n\nThe crew also tried to perform D-5, a navigation experiment. They were only able to track five stars, with six needed for accurate measurements. The last experiment, D-10, was to investigate an ion-sensing attitude control system. This experiment measured the attitude of the spacecraft from the flow of ions and electrons around the spacecraft in orbit. The results from this experiment showed the system to be accurate and responsive.\n\n===Re-entry===\n[[File:Gemini 10 Splashdown - GPN-2000-000995.jpg|thumb|left|Splashdown of Gemini 10.]]\n\nThe last day of the mission was short and retrofire came at 70 hours and 10 minutes into the mission. They landed only {{convert|5.6|km|nmi|sp=us|order=flip}} away from the intended landing site and were recovered by {{USS|Guadalcanal|LPH-7|6}}.\n\nThe Gemini 10 mission was supported by the following U.S. Department of Defense resources: 9,067 personnel, 78 aircraft and 13 ships.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Insignia==\n[[File:Gemini 10 Flown Fliteline Gold-Colored Medallion.jpg|thumb|Gemini 10 space-flown [[NASA space-flown Robbins medallions of the Apollo missions#Gemini mission space-flown Fliteline medallions|Fliteline Medallion]]]]\nThe patch is simple in design but highly symbolic. The main feature is a large X with a Gemini and Agena orbiting around it. The two stars have a variety of meanings: the two rendezvous attempts, Castor and Pollux in Gemini or the two crew members. This is one of the few crew patches without the crew's name. It is able to be displayed \"upside down\" but is correctly shown with the spacecraft to the right. It was designed by Young's first wife, Barbara.\n\n==Spacecraft location==\n[[File:Gemini X Capsule.jpg|thumb|The Gemini 10 space capsule on display at the [[Cosmosphere]] in Kansas]]\nFor many years the spacecraft was the centerpiece of a space exhibition at [[Norsk Teknisk Museum]], [[Oslo]], Norway. It was returned on request in 2002.\n\nThe spacecraft is currently on display at the [[Cosmosphere]] in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[Agena Target Vehicle]]\n* [[Extra-vehicular activity]]\n* [[List of spacewalks]]\n* [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|Splashdown]]\n* [[Space exploration]]\n* [[U.S. space exploration history on U.S. stamps]]\n* [[Space suit]]\n* [[Space capsule]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Gemini 10}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090621232459/https://mira.hq.nasa.gov/history/ws/hdmshrc/all/main/DDD/39987.pdf NASA Gemini 10 press kit - July 15, 1966]\n* [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19750067644/downloads/19750067644.pdf Gemini 10 Mission Report (PDF) August 1966]\n*{{Internet Archive short film | gemini_x_a_quick_look | Gemini X : A Quick Look }}\n* U.S. Space Objects Registry https://web.archive.org/web/20090521121750/http://usspaceobjectsregistry.state.gov/search/index.cfm\n\n{{Include-NASA}}\n\n{{Gemini program}}\n{{NASA space program}}\n{{Orbital launches in 1966}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box\n | title  = Human altitude record\n | years  = July 1966-Sept 1966\n | with   = \n | before = [[Voskhod 2]] crew\n | after  = [[Gemini 11]] crew\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n[[Category:Extravehicular activity]]\n[[Category:Human spaceflights]]\n[[Category:Project Gemini missions]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 1966]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched by Titan rockets]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 1966]]\n[[Category:July 1966 events]]\n[[Category:John Young (astronaut)]]\n[[Category:Michael Collins (astronaut)]]","_bytes":21488,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2023-09-07T13:37:02Z"},"title":"Gemini 10","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}
