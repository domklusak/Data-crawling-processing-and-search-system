The disproportionate number of [[Rallidae|rail]]s in this list reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists; these taxa are listed in [[List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species]].\n\nThe extinction dates given below are usually approximations of the actual date of extinction. In some cases, more exact dates are given as it is sometimes possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day (the [[San Benedicto rock wren]] is possibly the most extreme example – its extinction could be timed with an accuracy of maybe half an hour). Extinction dates in the literature are usually the dates of the last verified record (credible observation or specimen taken); for many Pacific birds that became extinct shortly after European contact, however, this leaves an uncertainty period of over 100 years, because the islands on which they lived were only rarely visited by scientists.\n\n[[File:Edwards' Dodo.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a dodo, with a red parrot on its left side, and a blue one at its right|The famous \"Edwards' [[Dodo]]\", painted by [[Roelant Savery]] in 1626]]\n\n==Extinct bird species==\n===[[Aepyornithiformes]]===\n* [[Aepyornis|Giant elephant bird]], ''Aepyornis maximus'' (Madagascar, 17th century?)\n* [[Aepyornis|Hildebrandt's elephant bird]], ''Aepyornis hildebrandti'' (Madagsacar, 17th century?)\n* [[Mullerornis|Lesser elephant bird]], ''Mullerornis modestus'' (Madagsacar, 17th century?)\n\n===[[Dinornithiformes]]===\n* [[Upland moa]], ''Megalapteryx didinus'' (South Island, New Zealand, late 15th century?)\n* [[South Island giant moa]], ''Dinornis robustus'' (South Island, New Zealand, late 15th century?)\n* [[Broad-billed moa]], ''Euryapteryx curtus'' (North and South Island, New Zealand, late 15th century?)\n\n===[[Apterygiformes]]===\n* West Coast spotted kiwi, ''Apteryx occidentalis'' (South Island, New Zealand, c.&nbsp;1900)\n*:A doubtfully distinct species known from a single specimen; may be a subspecies of the [[little spotted kiwi]] (''Apteryx owenii'') or a hybrid between that species and the [[Okarito kiwi]] (''Apteryx rowi'').\n\n===[[Anseriformes]]===\n[[Image:Camptorynchus labradoriusNHDP078CB.jpg|thumb|[[Labrador duck]]]]\n[[Duck]]s, [[Goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s\n* [[Crested shelduck]], ''Tadorna cristata'' (Northeast Asia, late 20th century?)\n*:A [[Relict (biology)|relict species]] from Northeast Asia.

Only known from two specimens taken in 1891. There have been a number of unconfirmed reports from all over the [[Sulu Archipelago]] in 1995; however, these reports stated that the bird had suddenly undergone a massive decline and, by now, habitat destruction is almost complete.

It may still exist, as an owl matching this bird's description was encountered in August 2006.<!-- http://extinctanimals.proboards22.com/index.cgi?board=rediscoveredbirds&action=display&thread=1118209580 -->\n* Peleng masked owl, ''Tyto rosenbergii pelengensis'' (Peleng, Banggai Islands, mid-20th century)\n*:A subspecies of the [[Sulawesi masked owl]] or a distinct species. It may possibly still exist, but the only known specimen was taken in 1938 and there have been no further records since then.\n* Samar bay owl, ''Phodilus badius riverae'' (Samar, Philippines, mid-20th century)\n*:A subspecies of the [[Oriental bay owl]] or a possibly distinct species. Its taxonomy is doubtful, but the only known specimen was lost in a 1945 bombing raid, so its validity cannot be verified; no population exists on Samar today.\n\n===[[Apodiformes]]===\n[[Swift (bird)|Swift]]s and [[hummingbird]]s\n* Miravalles indigo-capped hummingbird, ''Saucerottia cyanifrons alfaroana'' (Costa Rica, Central America, 20th century?)\n*:This subspecies of the [[indigo-capped hummingbird]] is only known from a specimen collected in Costa Rica in 1895. It is likely to have become extinct since then.\n* Alejandro Selkirk firecrown, ''Sephanoides fernandensis leyboldi'' (Alejandro Selkirk Island, Juan Fernández Islands, Southeast Pacific, 1908)\n*:A subspecies of the [[Juan Fernández firecrown]] last recorded in 1908.\n* Luzon Whitehead's swiftlet, ''Aerodramus whiteheadi whiteheadi'' (Luzon, Philippines, 20th century?)\n*:The nominate subspecies of [[Whitehead's swiftlet]] is only known from four specimens collected at [[Mount Data]] in 1895. Because of the lack of further records and massive habitat destruction, it is usually considered extinct. Given the size of the island, though, it may still exist.\n\n===[[Coraciiformes]]===\n[[Kingfisher]]s and related birds\n* Sangihe dwarf kingfisher, ''Ceyx fallax sangirensis'' ([[Sangihe Islands|Sangihe]], Indonesia, 1998?)\n*:This subspecies of the [[Sulawesi dwarf kingfisher]] was last seen in 1997 but not during a thorough survey one year later; it is either close to extinction or already extinct. Sometimes it is said to occur on the Talaud Islands also, but this is erroneous.\n* Guadalcanal little kingfisher, ''Ceyx pusillus aolae'' (Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, ?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[little kingfisher]].\n* Rarotonga kingfisher, ''Todiramphus'' cf. ''tutus'' (Rarotonga, Cook Islands, mid-1980s?)\n*:There exist reports of locals that kingfishers – probably a subspecies of the [[chattering kingfisher]] (''Todiramphus tutus'') which is found on neighboring islands, but possibly vagrants from there – were found until around 1979 and there is a last record from 1984. Presently, no kingfishers are known to exist on Rarotonga.<!-- Notornis 28 (1) p.84 -->\n* \"[[Ryukyu kingfisher]]\", \"''Todiramphus cinnamominus miyakoensis''\" (Miyako-jima, Ryukyu Islands, late 19th century)\n*:Previously considered as a distinct species, then reclassified as a subspecies of the [[Guam kingfisher]]. Only seen once by scientists in 1887; the specimen taken is somewhat damaged, making identification by anything other than molecular analysis difficult. It is now thought likely that the specimen came from Guam, where the aforementioned species was distributed, rather than Miyako, which would make this subspecies invalid (it was declared invalid by the [[International Ornithological Congress]] in 2022).\n* Sakarha pygmy kingfisher, ''Corythornis madagascariensis dilutus'' (southwestern Madagascar, late 20th century?)\n*:This subspecies of the [[Madagascar pygmy kingfisher]] is only known from one specimen taken in 1974 in an area where most of its habitat had already been destroyed. However, there have been records of the species (or an uncertain subspecies) from near the type locality, suggesting it is likely that it may still exist.\n* Ticao hornbill, ''Penelopides panini ticaensis'' (Ticao, Philippines, 1970s)\n*:A subspecies of the [[Visayan hornbill]] of somewhat uncertain taxonomic status (it was possibly a distinct species or possibly a color morph); the last confirmed report was in 1971 and it became extinct shortly thereafter.\n\n===[[Piciformes]]===\n[[Woodpecker]]s and related birds\n* Grand Bahama West Indian woodpecker, ''Melanerpes superciliaris bahamensis'' (Grand Bahama, Bahamas, 1950s)\n*:A subspecies of the [[West Indian woodpecker]] of somewhat uncertain validity.\n* Javan buff-rumped woodpecker, ''Meiglyptes tristis tristis'' (Java, Indonesia, c.&nbsp;1920?)\n*:The nominate subspecies of the [[buff-rumped woodpecker]] became rare during the 19th century due to habitat destruction. The last confirmed record was in 1880, and it is now considered to be at least very rare.\n* Guadalupe red-shafted flicker, ''Colaptes auratus rufipileus'' (Guadalupe Island, East Pacific, c.&nbsp;1906)\n*:A subspecies of the [[northern flicker]] (formerly considered to be a subspecies of the red-shafted flicker, as ''C. cafer rufipileus''), it was last recorded in 1906 and not found again in both 1911 and 1922. It may be invalid. Recently, vagrant birds of a mainland red-shafted northern flicker subspecies (which one is unknown) have begun recolonizing the island as the habitat improved after the [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of [[feral goat]]s.\n* Northern white-mantled barbet, ''Capito hypoleucus hypoleucus'' (Colombia, extant)\n*:The nominate subspecies of the [[white-mantled barbet]] has been considered extinct, but has been recorded recently.\n* Botero white-mantled barbet, ''Capito hypoleucus carrikeri'' (Colombia, extant)\n*:Another subspecies of the white-mantled barbet, also considered extinct by some sources, but confirmed extant by researchers in Colombia.\n* Todd's jacamar, ''Brachygalba lugubris phaeonota'' (Brazil, late 20th century?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[brown jacamar]], or possibly a hybrid, a color morph or a distinct species. It may still exist, as it is only known from a remote and seldom-visited area.\n* Cebu white-bellied woodpecker, ''Dryocopus javensis cebuensis'' (Cebu, Philippines, 20th century)\n*:A subspecies of the [[white-bellied woodpecker]] only known by three specimens collected before 1900.\n\n===[[Passeriformes]]===\n[[Perching bird]]s\n\n'''[[Pittidae]]''' &ndash; pittas\n* Bougainville black-faced pitta, ''Pitta anerythra pallida'' (Bougainville, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[black-faced pitta]].

Not found during recent searches; doubtful records from nearby islands, but it is also likely to have been overlooked.\n\n'''[[Tyrannidae]]''' &ndash; tyrant flycatchers\n* Bogotá bearded tachuri, ''Polystictus pectoralis bogotensis'' (central Colombia, 20th century)\n*:A subspecies of the [[bearded tachuri]] or possibly a distinct species that has not been recorded for some time and is now extinct.\n* Grenadan Euler's flycatcher, ''Lathrotriccus euleri flaviventris'' (Grenada, West Indies, 1950s?)\n*:A subspecies of [[Euler's flycatcher]] formerly known as ''Empidonax euleri johnstoni''. It has not been recorded since the 1950s.\n\n'''[[Furnariidae]]''' &ndash; ovenbirds\n* Peruvian scale-throated earthcreeper, ''Upucerthia dumetaria peruana'' (Peru, 20th century?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[scale-throated earthcreeper]]; it is known only from two specimens taken in the early 1950s at Puno, Peru and has not been seen or found since. It may still exist, as there is no obvious reason why it should have become extinct.\n* Northern stripe-crowned spinetail, ''Cranioleuca pyrrhophia rufipennis'' (northern Bolivia, 20th century?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[stripe-crowned spinetail]] known only from a few specimens and not recorded since the 1950s; it may be endangered or possibly extinct.\n\n'''[[Formicariidae]]''' &ndash; antpittas and antthrushes\n* Northern giant antpitta, ''Grallaria gigantea lehmanni'' (Colombia, 20th century?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[giant antpitta]] (or possibly of the [[great antpitta]], in which case it would be ''G. excelsa lehmanni'') apparently not recorded since the 1940s. It may still exist in [[Puracé National Natural Park]], where there is plentiful habitat remaining.\n* Antioquia brown-banded antpitta, ''Grallaria milleri gilesi'' (Antioquia, Colombia, 20th century?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[brown-banded antpitta]] recently described from a specimen collected in 1878. It has not been recorded since, despite surveys at a number of likely locations.\n\n'''[[Maluridae]]''' &ndash; Australasian \"wrens\"\n* Macdonnell Ranges thick-billed grasswren, ''Amytornis modestus modestus'' (Northern Territory, Australia, 1936)\n*:The nominate subspecies of the [[thick-billed grasswren]].

The latest record comes from 2002, suggesting a population is likely to still exist, but it is very rare.\n\n'''[[Petroicidae]]'''{{spaced ndash}}Australasian \"robins\"\n* Tiwi Island hooded robin, ''Melanodryas cucullata melvillensis'' (Tiwi Islands, Australia, 1992)\n*:A subspecies of the [[hooded robin]] last observed in 1992 and not found in exhaustive searches later in the 1990s.\n\n'''[[Cinclosomatidae]]''' &ndash; whipbirds and allies\n* Mount Lofty spotted quail-thrush, ''Cinclosoma punctatum anachoreta'' (Australia, mid-1980s?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[spotted quail-thrush]] last recorded in 1983 and not found in a survey the following year.\n\n'''[[Artamidae]]''' &ndash; woodswallows, currawongs and allies\n* Western pied currawong, ''Strepera graculina ashbyi'' (Victoria, Australia, 1927)\n*:This subspecies of the [[pied currawong]] has been hybridised out of existence by crossbreeding with other subspecies, which probably came into contact with it following habitat destruction in the 1830s. The last certainly distinct individuals were recorded in 1927.\n\n'''[[Monarchidae]]''' &ndash; monarch flycatchers\n* Negros celestial monarch, ''Hypothymis coelestis rabori'' (Negros and possibly Sibuyan, Philippines, late 20th century?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[celestial monarch]]; not uncommon on Negros in 1959, but not recorded since then. A single Sibuyan specimen from an unspecified locality taken in the 19th century is the only record for this island.\n* Hiva Oa monarch, ''Pomarea mendozae mendozae'' (Hiva Oa and Tahuata, Marquesas, late 20th century)\n*:The nominate subspecies of the [[Marquesas monarch]] which was very rare by 1974 and not found during multiple surveys in the 1990s.\n\n'''[[Rhipiduridae]]''' &ndash; fantails\n* Lord Howe fantail, ''Rhipidura fuliginosa cervina'' (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c.&nbsp;1924)\n*:A subspecies of the [[New Zealand fantail]] that was considered virtually extinct in 1924 and not found by surveys four years later.\n* Guam rufous fantail, ''Rhipidura rufifrons uraniae'' (Guam and Marianas, West Pacific, 1984)\n*:A subspecies of the [[rufous fantail]]; a conspicuous bird which has not been recorded since 1984.\n\n'''[[Campephagidae]]''' &ndash; cuckooshrikes and trillers\n* Cebu bar-bellied cuckooshrike, ''Coracina striata cebuensis'' (Cebu, Philippines, early 20th century)\n*:A subspecies of the [[bar-bellied cuckooshrike]] not recorded since its collection in 1906.\n* Maros cicadabird, ''Edolisoma tenuirostre edithae'' (Sulawesi, mid-20th century)\n*:A subspecies of the [[common cicadabird]] known from a single specimen collected in 1931; quite possibly just a vagrant individual.\n* Cebu blackish cuckooshrike, ''Edolisoma coerulescens altera'' (Cebu, Philippines, 20th century?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[blackish cuckooshrike]]; it may still exist, as this bird is rather unmistakable, and a 1999 record is therefore likely to be valid, though surveys since then have failed to record it.\n* Marinduque blackish cuckooshrike, ''Edolisoma coerulescens deschauenseei'' (Marinduque, Philippines, late 20th century?)\n*:Another subspecies of the blackish cuckooshrike; described from specimens collected in 1971, but apparently not seen since then. As few ornithologists have visited Marinduque and forest remains on the island, it is likely that it may still exist.\n* [[Norfolk triller|Norfolk long-tailed triller]], ''Lalage leucopyga leucopyga'' (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, 1942)\n*:The nominate subspecies of the [[long-tailed triller]] or possibly a distinct species.\n\n'''[[Oriolidae]]''' &ndash; Old World orioles and allies\n* Cebu dark-throated oriole, ''Oriolus xanthonotus assimilis'' (Cebu, Philippines, 20th century?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[dark-throated oriole]] not confirmed since 1906, though there were unconfirmed reports c. 2001, suggesting a possibility that it may still exist.\n\n'''[[Corvidae]]''' &ndash; crows, ravens, jays and magpies\n* [[Pied raven]], ''Corvus corax varius'' morpha ''leucophaeus'' (Faroe Islands, North Atlantic, 1902)\n*:A distinct local white-with-black-markings and light brown-billed [[Polymorphism (biology)|color morph]] of the North Atlantic raven, a subspecies of the [[common raven]], found only on the Faroe Islands and not seen since 1902. Birds currently living on the Faroe Islands and on Iceland (the only other area in this subspecies' range) are all-black and black-billed; this still-existing color morph is named ''Corvus corax varius'' morpha ''typicus''.\n\n'''[[Regulidae]]''' &ndash; kinglets\n* Guadalupe ruby-crowned kinglet, ''Corthylio calendula obscurus'' (Guadalupe Island, East Pacific, 20th century)\n*:A subspecies of the [[Ruby-crowned kinglet#Taxonomy|ruby-crowned kinglet]] that has not been recorded since 1953.\n\n'''[[Hirundinidae]]''' &ndash; swallows and martins\n* Jamaican golden swallow, ''Tachycineta euchrysea euchrysea'' (Jamaica, West Indies, c.&nbsp;1990?)\n*:The nominate subspecies of the [[Golden swallow (bird)|golden swallow]]; endemic to Jamaica.

Its placement in Cettiidae requires confirmation.\n\n'''[[Acrocephalidae]]''' &ndash; acrocephalid warblers or marsh warblers, tree warblers and reed warblers\n* Marshall Islands reed warbler, ''Acrocephalus rehsei'' ssp.? (Marshall Islands, Micronesia, c.&nbsp;1880?)\n*:Oral tradition and some early reports mention a bird called the ''annañ'' which inhabited some of the Marshall Islands. The best match is the [[Nauru reed warbler]]; the ''annañ'' might have been an undescribed subspecies of that species or a distinct but related species of reed warbler.<ref name = spennemann2006 />\n* [[Laysan millerbird]], ''Acrocephalus familiaris familiaris'' (Laysan, Hawaiian Islands, late 1910s)\n*:The nominate subspecies of the [[millerbird]].\n\n'''[[Pycnonotidae]]''' &ndash; bulbuls\n* Sumatran blue-wattled bulbul, ''Pycnonotus nieuwenhuisii inexspectatus'' (Sumatra, Indonesia, late 20th century?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[blue-wattled bulbul]] known only from a single specimen taken in 1937; however, this entire \"species\" may be a hybrid.\n\n'''[[Cisticolidae]]''' &ndash; cisticolas and allies\n* Northern white-winged apalis, ''Apalis chariessa chariessa'' (Kenya, Africa, late 20th century?)\n*:The nominate subspecies of the [[white-winged apalis]] remains known only from the Tana River, a [[centre of endemism]].

Its placement in Sylviidae is doubtful.\n* Fayyum warbler, ''Curruca melanocephala'' / ''momus norissae'' (Egypt, Africa, 1939)\n*:A doubtfully distinct subspecies of the [[Sardinian warbler]]. It has not been recorded since 1939.\n\n'''[[Zosteropidae]]''' &ndash; white-eyes. Probably belong in Timaliidae.\n* Guam bridled white-eye, ''Zosterops conspicillatus conspicillatus'' (Guam and Marianas, West Pacific, 1983)\n*:The nominate subspecies of the [[bridled white-eye]] or possibly a monotypic species.

Birds surviving on Tanna, New Hebrides, are presently considered to be the same subspecies; however, given the fact that this species readily differentiates into subspecies and that the distance between Tanna and Lifou is considerable, the Tanna birds may belong to a different subspecies, in which case the Lifou thrush would be considered extinct.\n* Saint Lucia forest thrush, ''Turdus lherminieri sanctaeluciae'' (St. Lucia, West Indies, extant)\n*:A subspecies of the [[forest thrush]]. It has been thought to be extinct, but it was recorded at Des Chassin in 2007.\n* Peleng red-and-black thrush, ''Geohichia mendeni mendeni'' (Peleng, Indonesia, mid-20th century?)\n*:The nominate subspecies of the [[red-and-black thrush]]; little is known about it.\n* Kibale black-eared ground thrush, ''Geohichia camaronensis kibalensis'' (southwestern Uganda, Africa, late 20th century?)\n*:A subspecies of the [[black-eared ground thrush]] or possibly a distinct species; known only from two specimens, both from 1966.

Roosevelt\n\nThe White House,\n\nFebruary 19, 1942.\n}}\n\n==Background to the Order==\n\nThe Order was consistent with Roosevelt's long-time racial views toward Japanese Americans.  During the 1920s, for example, he had written articles in the [[Macon Telegraph]] opposing white-Japanese intermarriage for fostering \"the mingling of Asiatic blood with European or American blood\" and praising California's ban on land ownership by the first-generation Japanese.  In 1936, while president he privately wrote that, in regard to contacts between Japanese sailors and the local Japanese American population in the event of war, “every Japanese citizen or non-citizen on the Island of Oahu who meets these Japanese ships or has any connection with their officers or men should be secretly but definitely identified and his or her name placed on a special list of those who would be the first to be placed in a concentration camp.\"  In addition, during the crucial period after Pearl Harbor the president had failed to speak out for the rights of Japanese Americans despite the urgings of advisors such as [[John Franklin Carter]].  During the same period, Roosevelt rejected the recommendations of Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]] and other top advisors, who opposed the incarnation of Japanese Americans.<ref>{{cite book | last=Beito | first=David T. | title=The New Deal's War on the Bill of Rights: The Untold  Story of FDR's Concentration Camps, Censorship, and Mass Surveillance | edition=First | pages=165-173| location=Oakland | publisher=Independent Institute | year=2023 | isbn=978-1598133561}}</ref>\n\n==Exclusion under the order==\nOn March 21, 1942, Roosevelt signed Public Law 77-503<ref name=PL77-503>An act to provide a penalty for violation of restriction or orders with respect to persons entering, remaining in, leaving, or committing any act in military areas or zones. {{USStatute|77|503|56|173|1942|03|21}}.</ref> (approved after only an hour of discussion in the Senate and thirty minutes in the House) in order to provide for the enforcement of his executive order.

As a result, approximately 112,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry were evicted from the West Coast of the continental United States and held in American relocation camps and other confinement sites across the country. EO 9066 was not applied in such a sweeping manner to persons of non-Japanese descent.

The \"evacuees\" were taken first to temporary [[Internment of Japanese Americans#WCCA Civilian Assembly Centers|assembly centers]], requisitioned fairgrounds and horse racing tracks where living quarters were often converted livestock stalls. As construction on the more permanent and isolated War Relocation Authority camps was completed, the population was transferred by truck or train. These accommodations consisted of tar paper-walled frame buildings in parts of the country with bitter winters and often hot summers. The camps were guarded by armed soldiers and fenced with barbed wire (security measures not shown in published photographs of the camps). Camps held up to 18,000 people, and were small cities, with medical care, food, and education provided by the government. Adults were offered \"camp jobs\" with wages of $12 to $19 per month, and many camp services such as medical care and education were provided by the camp inmates themselves.<ref name=\"Calisphere\"/>\n\n==Termination, apology, and redress==\n[[File:President Gerald R.

Ickes]].  Ickes blamed the president's failure to act on his need to win California in a potentially close election.  In December 1944, Roosevelt suspended Executive Order after the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Ex parte Endo]]''. Detainees were released, often to resettlement facilities and temporary housing, and the camps were shut down by 1946.<ref name=Calisphere /> \n\nIn the years after the war, the interned Japanese Americans had to rebuild their lives after having suffered heavy personal losses. United States citizens and long-time residents who had been incarcerated lost their personal liberties; many also lost their homes, businesses, property, and savings. Individuals born in Japan were not allowed to become naturalized US citizens until after passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]].<ref name=Calisphere />\n\nOn February 19, 1976, President [[Gerald Ford]] signed a proclamation formally terminating Executive Order 9066 and apologizing for the internment, stated: \"We now know what we should have known then — not only was that evacuation wrong but Japanese-Americans were and are loyal Americans.

The CWRIC was appointed to conduct an official governmental study of Executive Order 9066, related wartime orders, and their effects on Japanese Americans in the West and [[Alaska Natives]] in the [[Pribilof Islands]].\n\nIn December 1982, the CWRIC issued its findings in ''Personal Justice Denied'', concluding that the incarceration of Japanese Americans had not been justified by military necessity. The report determined that the decision to incarcerate was based on \"race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership\". The Commission recommended legislative remedies consisting of an official [[Federal Government of the United States|Government]] apology and redress payments of $20,000 to each of the survivors; a public education fund was set up to help ensure that this would not happen again ({{USPL|100|383}}).\n\nOn August 10, 1988, the [[Civil Liberties Act of 1988]], based on the CWRIC recommendations, was signed into law by [[Ronald Reagan]].

He formalized his name change in 1988. He viewed traditional names as almost always stamping a label of [[collective identity]] – varying from [[gender]] to nationality – on the individual, thereby existing as prima facie elements of thought processes in the human cultural fabric, that tended to degenerate into stereotyping, factionalism, and discrimination. In his own words, \"Conventional names define a person's past: ancestry, ethnicity, nationality, religion. I am not who I was ten years ago and certainly not who I will be in twenty years. [...] The name 2030 reflects my conviction that the years around 2030 will be a magical time.

FM-2030 identified with the former. He argued that the [[nuclear family]] structure and the idea of a city would disappear, being replaced by modular social communities he called ''mobilia'', powered by [[communitarianism]], which would persist and then disappear.<ref name=Vice />\n\nFM-2030 believed that synthetic body parts would one day make life expectancy irrelevant; shortly before his death from pancreatic cancer, he described the [[pancreas]] as \"a stupid, dumb, wretched organ.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2000-07-11-0007120009-story.html | title=Futurist Has Body Frozen in Hopes of Cancer Cure | website=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=July 11, 2000 | access-date=November 2, 2022 | archive-date=November 2, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221102214940/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2000-07-11-0007120009-story.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn terms of civilization, he stated: \"No civilization of the past was great. They were all primitive and persecutory, founded on mass subjugation and mass murder.\" In terms of identity, he stated \"The young modern is not losing his identity. He is gladly disencumbering himself of it.\" He believed that eventually, nations would disappear and that identities would shift from cultural to personal. In a 1972 op-Ed in ''[[The New York Times]]'', he wrote that the leadership in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] had failed, and that the warring sides were \"acting like adolescents, refuse to resolve their wasteful 25-year-old brawl\" and believed that the world was \"irreversibly evolving beyond the concept of national homeland.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bidoun.org/articles/the-future-takes-forever |title=The Future Takes Forever: Becoming FM-2030 |website=bidoun.org |access-date=October 13, 2022 |archive-date=October 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221013132412/https://www.bidoun.org/articles/the-future-takes-forever |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nFM-2030 was a lifelong vegetarian and said he would not eat anything that had a mother.
