[[NASA]], the mission's operator, described it as a \"dress rehearsal\" for the first [[Moon landing]] ([[Apollo 11]], two months later{{sfn|Press Kit|p=1}}).<!-- The source is only for NASA's description of Apollo 10 as a dress rehearsal --> It was designated an [[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|\"F\"{{nbsp}}mission]], intended to test all [[spacecraft]] components and procedures short of actual descent and landing. \n\nAfter the spacecraft reached lunar orbit, astronaut [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] remained in the [[Apollo Command and Service Module|Command and Service Module]] (CSM) while astronauts [[Thomas P. Stafford|Thomas Stafford]] and [[Gene Cernan]] flew the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM) to within {{convert|7.8|nmi|km|sp=us|order=flip}} of the [[lunar surface]], the point at which powered descent for landing would begin on a landing mission. Then they rejoined Young in the CSM and, after the CSM completed its 31st orbit of the Moon, they returned safely to Earth.\n\nWhile NASA had considered attempting the first crewed lunar landing on Apollo 10, mission planners ultimately decided that it would be prudent to have a practice flight to hone the procedures and techniques. The crew encountered some problems during the flight: [[pogo oscillations]] during the launch phase and a brief, uncontrolled tumble of the LM ascent stage in lunar orbit during its solo flight. However, the mission accomplished its major objectives. Stafford and Cernan observed and photographed Apollo 11's planned landing site in the [[Sea of Tranquility]]. Apollo 10 spent 61 hours and 37 minutes orbiting the Moon, for about eight hours of which Stafford and Cernan flew the LM apart from Young in the CSM, and about eight days total in space. Additionally, Apollo 10 set the record for the highest speed attained by a crewed vehicle: 39,897&nbsp;km/h (11.08&nbsp;km/s or 24,791&nbsp;mph) on May 26, 1969, during the return from the Moon.\n\nThe mission's [[call sign]]s were the names of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' characters [[Charlie Brown]] for the CSM and [[Snoopy]] for the LM, who became Apollo 10's semi-official mascots.<ref>{{cite web |date=May 28, 1969 |title=Replicas of Snoopy and Charlie Brown decorate top of console in MCC |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010619231200/http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.jpg |archive-date=June 19, 2001 |access-date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=[[NASA]] |id=NASA Photo ID: S69-34314}} Photo description available [http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.htm here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005150651/https://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.htm|date=October 5, 2021}}.</ref> ''Peanuts'' creator [[Charles Schulz]] also drew mission-related artwork for NASA.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McKinnon |first1=Mika |title=Snoopy the Astrobeagle, NASA's Mascot for Safety |url=https://gizmodo.com/snoopy-the-astrobeagle-nasas-mascot-for-safety-1570066950 |website=[[Gizmodo]] |date=April 30, 2014 |access-date=6 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Framework==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{for|a fuller overview of this subject|Apollo program}}\n\nBy 1967, NASA had devised a [[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|list of mission types]], designated by letters, that needed to be flown before a landing attempt, which would be the \"G\" mission. The early uncrewed flights were considered \"A\" or \"B\" missions, while [[Apollo 7]], the crewed-flight test of the [[Apollo Command and Service Module|Command and Service Module]] (CSM), was the \"C\" mission. The first crewed orbital test of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) was accomplished on [[Apollo 9]], the \"D\" mission. [[Apollo 8]], flown to the Moon's orbit without an LM, was considered a \"C-prime\" mission, but its success gave NASA the confidence to skip the \"E\" mission, which would have tested the full Apollo spacecraft in medium or high Earth orbit. Apollo 10, the dress rehearsal for the lunar landing, was to be the \"F\" mission.<ref name = \"drew\" />{{sfn|Brooks|pp=234–235}}\n\nNASA considered skipping the \"F\" mission as well and attempting the first lunar landing on Apollo 10. Some with the agency advocated this, feeling it senseless to bring astronauts so close to the lunar surface, only to turn away. Although the lunar module intended for Apollo 10 was too heavy to perform the lunar mission, the one intended for [[Apollo 11]] could be substituted by delaying Apollo 10 a month from its May 1969 planned launch.{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=151–152}} NASA official [[George Mueller (engineer)|George Mueller]] favored a landing attempt on {{nowrap|Apollo 10}}; he was known for his aggressive approach to moving the [[Apollo program]] forward.<ref name = \"Hamish\">{{cite web|last=Lindsay|first=Hamish|publisher=Colin Hackellar|title=Apollo 10|url=https://honeysucklecreek.net/msfn_missions/Apollo_10_mission/hl_apollo10.html|access-date=July 2, 2022}}</ref> However, Director of Flight Operations [[Christopher C. Kraft]] and others opposed this, feeling that new procedures would have to be developed for a rendezvous in lunar orbit and that NASA had incomplete information regarding the Moon's [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]]s, which might throw off the spacecraft's trajectory. Lieutenant General [[Samuel C.

However, it is formally dated as 1700 in official use, such as the listing for the act in the ''[[Chronological Table of the Statutes]]'', because acts passed before the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]] came into force are dated by the year in which the relevant parliamentary session began, which, in this case, was 6 February 1700 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]) (6 February 1701 NS).}} More specifically, anyone who became a Roman Catholic, or who married one, became disqualified to inherit the throne. This had the effect of deposing the remaining descendants of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], other than his Protestant granddaughter [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], as the next Protestant in line to the throne was [[Sophia of Hanover]]. Born into the [[House of Wittelsbach]], she was a granddaughter of [[James VI and I]] from his most junior surviving line,{{efn|Her only younger sibling [[Gustavus Adolphus of the Palatinate]] had died as a 9-year-old boy in 1641}} with the crowns descending only to her non-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] heirs. Sophia died shortly before the death of Queen Anne, and Sophia's son succeeded to the throne as [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], starting the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian dynasty]] in Britain.\n\nThe [[Act of Supremacy 1558]] had confirmed the independence of the [[Church of England]] from [[Latin Church|Roman Catholicism]] under the English monarch. One of the principal factors which contributed to the [[Glorious Revolution]] was the perceived assaults made on the Church by King [[James II of England|James II]], a Roman Catholic, who was deposed in favour of his Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and her husband [[William III of England|William III]]. The need for this Act of Settlement was prompted by the inability of William and Mary, as well as of Mary's Protestant sister (the future Queen Anne), to produce any surviving children, and by the perceived threat posed by the pretensions to the throne by remaining Roman Catholic members of the [[House of Stuart]].\n\n[[File:Act of Settlement 3323.jpg|thumb|right|Facsimile of the '''Act of Settlement''' sent to Electress [[Sophia of Hanover]]]]\n\nThe Act played a key role in the formation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] as, though England and Scotland had [[Union of the Crowns|shared a monarch]] since 1603, they had remained separately governed countries, with the Act catalysing the [[Union of England and Scotland]]. However, the [[Parliament of Scotland]] was more reluctant to abandon the House of Stuart, members of which had been [[Scottish monarchs]] long before they became English. Moreover, the Act also placed limits on both the role of foreigners in the British government and the power of the monarch with respect to the Parliament of England, though some of those provisions have been altered by subsequent legislation.\n\nAlong with the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the Act of Settlement remains today one of the main constitutional laws governing the [[Succession to the British throne|succession]] not only to the [[throne of the United Kingdom]], but to those of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, whether by assumption or by [[patriation]].<ref name=\"Topo\">{{cite journal| last=Toporoski| first=Richard| title=The Invisible Crown| journal=Monarchy Canada| issue=Summer 1998| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=1998| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| access-date=16 May 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209220704/http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| archive-date=9 February 2008}}</ref> The Act of Settlement cannot be altered in any realm except by that realm's own parliament and, by [[Convention (norm)#Government|convention]], only with the consent of all the other realms, as it touches on the succession to the [[Commonwealth realm#The Crown in the Commonwealth realms|shared crown]].<ref>{{Cite legislation UK |type=act |year=1931 |chapter=4 |act=The Statute of Westminster 1931}}</ref> On 26 March 2015, following the [[Perth Agreement]], legislation amending the Act came into effect across the Commonwealth realms that removed the disqualification arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic and instituted [[absolute primogeniture]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Queen Anne and William, Duke of Gloucester by studio of Sir Godfrey Kneller.jpg|thumb|[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]] with [[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]], whose death in 1700 was the predicate for the Act|alt=Anne and her son embrace against a Baroque garden background]]\nFollowing the [[Glorious Revolution]], the line of succession to the English throne was governed by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], which declared that the flight of [[James II of England|James II]] from England to France during the revolution amounted to an [[abdication]] of the throne and that James's daughter [[Mary II]] and her husband/cousin, [[William III of England|William III]] (William of Orange, who was also James's nephew), were James's successors. The Bill of Rights also provided that the line of succession would go through Mary's Protestant descendants by William and any possible future husband should she outlive him, then through Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] and her Protestant descendants, and then to the Protestant descendants of William III by a possible later marriage should he outlive Mary. During the debate, the House of Lords had attempted to append Sophia and her descendants to the line of succession, but the amendment failed in the Commons.<ref name=melville>{{cite book|last=Melville|first=Lewis|title=The First George in Hanover and England|url=https://archive.org/details/firstgeorgeinhan00melvuoft|year=1908|publisher=Isaac Pitman and Sons|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/firstgeorgeinhan00melvuoft/page/130 130]–131}}</ref>\n\nMary II died childless in 1694, after which William III did not remarry. In 1700, [[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]], who was Anne's only child to survive infancy, died of what may have been [[smallpox]] at the age of 11.<ref>{{cite book | last = Snowden |first = Frank M. | title = Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present | place = New Haven, Connecticut | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2019 | isbn = 978-0-300-19221-6| page=99}}</ref> Thus, Anne was left as the only person in line to the throne. The Bill of Rights excluded Catholics from the throne, which ruled out James II and his children (as well as their descendants) sired after he converted to Catholicism in 1668. However, it did not provide for the further succession after Anne. Parliament thus saw the need to settle the succession on Sophia and her descendants, and thereby guarantee the continuity of the Crown in the Protestant line.\n\nWith religion and lineage initially decided, the ascendancy of William of Orange in 1689 would also bring his partiality to his foreign favourites that followed. By 1701 English jealousy of foreigners was rampant, and action was considered necessary.<ref name=\"Henriq\"/>\n\n==The Act==\nThe Act of Settlement provided that the throne would pass to the [[Sophia of Hanover|Electress Sophia of Hanover]]&nbsp;– a granddaughter of [[James I of England|James VI and I]] and a niece of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]&nbsp;– and her descendants, but it excluded \"for ever\" \"all and every Person and Persons who ... is are or shall be reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the [[Holy See|See]] or [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]] or shall profess the Popish Religion or shall marry a Papist\". Thus, those who were Roman Catholics, and those who married Roman Catholics, were barred from ascending the throne.\n\n=== Conditional provisions ===\nThe Act contained eight additional provisions that were to only come into effect upon the death of both William and Anne:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/1700/1565208.html |title=Act of Settlement 1700 |publisher=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute|BAILII]] |access-date=20 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nFirstly, the monarch \"shall join in communion with the [[Church of England]]\". This was intended to ensure the exclusion of a Roman Catholic monarch. Along with James II's perceived despotism, his religion was the main cause of the Glorious Revolution, and of the previous linked religious and succession problems which had been resolved by the joint monarchy of William III and Mary II.\n\nSecond, if a person not native to England comes to the throne, England will not wage war for \"any dominions or territories which do not belong to the Crown of England, without the consent of Parliament\". This would become relevant when a member of the [[House of Hanover]] ascended the British throne, as he would retain the territories of the [[Kingdom of Hanover|Electorate of Hanover]] in what is now [[Lower Saxony]] (Germany), then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This provision has been dormant since [[Queen Victoria]] ascended the throne, because she did not inherit Hanover under the [[Salic Law]]s of the German-speaking states.\n\nThird, no monarch may leave \"the dominions of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], or [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]\", without the consent of Parliament. This provision was repealed in 1716, at the request of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] who was also the [[prince-elector|Elector of Hanover]] and Duke of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; because of this, and also for personal reasons, he wished to visit Hanover from time to time.{{Sfn|Naamani Tarkow|1943|pages=537–561 at p. 547}}\n\nFourth, all government matters within the jurisdiction of the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] were to be transacted there, and all council resolutions were to be signed by those who advised and consented to them. This was because Parliament wanted to know who was deciding policies, as sometimes councillors' signatures normally attached to resolutions were absent. This provision was repealed early in Queen Anne's reign, as many councillors ceased to offer advice and some stopped attending meetings altogether.{{Sfn|Naamani Tarkow|1943|pages=537–561 at p. 547}}\n\nFifth, no foreigner (\"no Person born out of the Kingdoms of England Scotland or Ireland or the Dominions thereunto belonging\"), even if naturalised or made a [[Denization|denizen]] (unless born of English parents), can be a Privy Councillor or a member of either House of Parliament, or hold \"any Office or Place of Trust, either Civill {{sic}} or Military, or to [''sic''] have any Grant of Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments from the Crown, to himself or to any other or others in Trust for him\".<ref name=\"Henriq\">{{cite journal |first=H. S. |last=Henriques |jstor=1451130 |title=The Political Rights of English Jews |journal=[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |date=January 1907 |pages=311–312|doi=10.2307/1451130 }}</ref> Subsequent nationality laws (today primarily the [[British Nationality Act 1981]]) made naturalised citizens the equal of those native born, and excluded Commonwealth citizens from the definition of foreigners, and citizens of the Irish Republic from the definition of aliens, but otherwise this provision still applies. It has however been disapplied in particular cases by a number of other statutes.\n\nSixth, no person who has an office under the monarch, or receives a pension from the Crown, was to be a Member of Parliament. This provision was inserted to avoid unwelcome royal influence over the House of Commons. It remains in force, but with several exceptions; ministers of the Crown were exempted early on before Anne's death in order to continue some degree of royal patronage, but [[ministerial by-election|had to stand for a by-election]] to re-enter the House upon such appointment until 1926. As a side effect, this provision means that members of the Commons seeking to resign from parliament can get around the [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|prohibition on resignation]] by obtaining a [[sinecure]] in the control of the Crown; while several offices have historically been used for this purpose, two are currently in use: appointments generally alternate between the stewardships of the [[Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds|Chiltern Hundreds]] and of the [[Steward of the Manor of Northstead|Manor of Northstead]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P11.pdf |work=House of Commons Information Office |title=The Chiltern Hundreds |date=1 June 2008 |access-date=12 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003101512/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P11.pdf |archive-date=3 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nSeventh, Judges' commissions are valid ''quamdiu se bene gesserint'' (during good behaviour) and if they do not behave themselves, they can be removed only by both Houses of Parliament (or in other Commonwealth realms the one House of Parliament, depending on the legislature's structure). This provision was the result of various monarchs influencing judges' decisions, and its purpose was to assure [[judicial independence]]. This [[letters patent|patent]] was used prior to 1701 but did not prevent [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] from removing Sir [[John Walter (judge)|John Walter]] as [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]].\n\nEighth, that \"no Pardon under the [[Great Seal of England]] be pleadable to an Impeachment by the Commons in Parliament\". This meant in effect that no pardon by the monarch was to save someone from being [[Impeachment in the United Kingdom|impeached]] by the House of Commons.\n\n{{wide image|House of Stuart.png|1500px|Relationship of [[Sophia of Hanover|Electress Sophia of Hanover]] and [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] with the House of Stuart.}}\n\n==Opposition==\nThe [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] administration that replaced the [[Whig Junto]] in 1699 took responsibility for steering the Act through Parliament. As a result, it passed with little opposition, although five peers voted against it in the House of Lords, including the [[Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon|Earl of Huntingdon]], his brother-in-law the [[Robert Leke, 3rd Earl of Scarsdale|Earl of Scarsdale]] and three others.<ref>House of Lords Journal Volume 16: 22 May 1701, in https://www.british-history.ac.uk/lords-jrnl/vol16/pp698-699#h3-0009. Retrieved 1 October 2019.</ref> While many shared their opposition to a 'foreign' king, the general feeling was summed up as 'better a German prince than a French one.'{{sfn|Somerset|2012|p=165}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2011}}\n{{Succession to the British throne sidebar}}For different reasons, various [[constitutionalist]]s have praised the Act of Settlement: [[Henry Hallam]] called the Act \"the seal of our constitutional laws\" and [[David Lindsay Keir]] placed its importance above the Bill of Rights of 1689.{{Sfn|Naamani Tarkow|1943|page=537}} Naamani Tarkow wrote: \"If one is to make sweeping statements, one may say that, save [[Magna Carta]] (more truly, its implications), the Act of Settlement is probably the most significant statute in English history\".{{Sfn|Naamani Tarkow|1943|page=561}}\n\n=== Union of Scotland with England and Wales ===\nThe Act of Settlement was, in many ways, the major cause of the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] of Scotland with England and Wales to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] was not happy with the Act of Settlement and, in response, passed the [[Act of Security]] in 1704, through which Scotland reserved the right to choose its own successor to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Stemming from this, the Parliament of England decided that, to ensure the stability and future prosperity of Great Britain, full union of the two parliaments and nations was essential before Anne's death.\n\nIt used a combination of exclusionary legislation (the [[Alien Act 1705]]), politics, and [[bribery]] to achieve this within three years under the [[Act of Union 1707]]. This success was in marked contrast to the four attempts at political union between 1606 and 1689, which all failed owing to a lack of political will in both kingdoms. By virtue of Article II of the [[Treaty of Union]], which defined the succession to the throne of Great Britain, the Act of Settlement became part of [[Scots law]] as well.\n\n===Succession to the Crown===\nIn addition to excluding [[James II of England|James II]], who died a few months after the Act received royal assent, and his Roman Catholic children, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Prince James]] (''The Old Pretender'') and the [[Louisa Maria Stuart|Princess Royal]], the Act also excluded the descendants of Princess [[Henrietta of England|Henrietta]], the youngest sister of James II.

Elizabeth had borne nine children who reached adulthood, of whom [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia]] was the youngest daughter. However in 1701 Sophia was the senior Protestant one, therefore with a legitimate claim to the English throne; Parliament passed over her Roman Catholic siblings, namely her sister [[Louise Hollandine of the Palatinate]], and their descendants, who included [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Madame Palatine|Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orléans]]; [[Louis Otto, Prince of Salm]], and his aunts; [[Anne Henriette of Bavaria|Anne Henriette, Princess of Condé]], and [[Benedicta Henrietta of the Palatinate|Benedicta Henrietta, Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg]].\n\n===Removal from the succession due to Catholicism===\n[[File:Kurfuerstin Sophie.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]]]]Since the Act's passing the most senior living member of the royal family to have married a Roman Catholic, and thereby to have been removed from the line of succession, is [[Prince Michael of Kent]], who married [[Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz]] in 1978; he was fifteenth in the line of succession at the time.

His son, [[Edward Windsor, Lord Downpatrick|Lord Downpatrick]], converted to Roman Catholicism in 2003 and is the most senior descendant of Sophia to be barred as a result of his religion. In 2008 his daughter, [[Lady Marina Windsor]], also converted to Catholicism and was removed from the line of succession. More recently, [[Peter Phillips]], the son of [[Anne, Princess Royal]], and eleventh in line to the throne, married [[Autumn Phillips|Autumn Kelly]]; Kelly had been brought up as a Roman Catholic, but she converted to [[Anglicanism]] prior to the wedding. Had she not done so, Phillips would have forfeited his place in the succession upon their marriage, only to have it restored in 2015.\n\nExcluding those princesses who have married into Roman Catholic royal families, such as [[Marie of Romania|Marie of Edinburgh]], [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] and [[Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh]], one member of the Royal Family (that is, with the style of ''[[Royal Highness]]'') has converted to Roman Catholicism since the passage of the Act: the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]], wife of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], who converted on 14 January 1994, but her husband did not lose his place in the succession because she was an Anglican at the time of their marriage.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|date=2011-09-18|title=Catholics hail Duchess of Kent's conversion|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/catholics-hail-duchess-of-kent-s-conversion-1399421.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-12|website=The Independent|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211008031910/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/catholics-hail-duchess-of-kent-s-conversion-1399421.html|archive-date=8 October 2021}}</ref>\n\n=== Present status ===\nAs well as being part of the law of the United Kingdom, the Act of Settlement was received into the laws of all the countries and territories over which the British monarch reigned. It remains part of the laws of the 15 [[Commonwealth realm]]s and the relevant jurisdictions within those realms. In accordance with established convention, the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] and later laws, the Act of Settlement (along with the other laws governing the succession of the Commonwealth realms) may only be changed with the agreement of all the realms (and, in some federal realms, the constituent members of those federations). The [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] changed many provisions of this Act.\n\n==Amendment proposals==\nChallenges have been made against the Act of Settlement, especially its provisions regarding Roman Catholics and [[Primogeniture|preference for males]]. However, changing the Act is a complex process, since the Act governs the shared succession of all the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] acknowledges by established convention that any changes to the rules of succession may be made only with the agreement of all of the states involved, with concurrent amendments to be made by each state's parliament or parliaments. Further, as the current monarch's eldest child and, in turn, his eldest child, are Anglican males, any change to the succession laws would have no immediate implications. Consequently, there was little public concern with the issues and debate had been confined largely to academic circles until the November 2010 announcement that [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|Prince William was to marry]]. This raised the question of what would happen if he were to produce first a daughter and then a son.\n\n''[[The Times]]'' reported on 6 November 1995 that [[Charles III of the United Kingdom|Prince Charles]] had said on that day to [[Tony Blair]] and [[Paddy Ashdown]] that \"Catholics should be able to ascend to the British throne\".

[[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor|Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor]], the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England, pointed out that Prince William (later the Duke of Cambridge) \"can marry by law a [[Hindu]], a [[Buddhist]], anyone, but not a Roman Catholic.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2021615.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Let monarchy marry Catholics |date=2 June 2002 |access-date=30 March 2010 }}</ref> Opponents of repeal, such as [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Adrian Hilton]], believe that it would lead to the disestablishment of the Church of England as the state religion if a Roman Catholic were to come to the throne. They also note that the monarch must swear to defend the faith and be a member of the [[Anglican Communion]], but that a Roman Catholic monarch would, like all Roman Catholics, owe allegiance to the Pope. This would, according to opponents of repeal, amount to a loss of sovereignty for the Anglican Church.\n\nWhen in December 1978 there was media speculation that [[Charles III of the United Kingdom|Prince Charles]] might marry a Roman Catholic, Powell defended the provision that excludes Roman Catholics from ascending the throne, stating his objection was not rooted in religious bigotry but in political considerations. He said a Roman Catholic monarch would mean the acceptance of a source of authority external to the realm and \"in the literal sense, foreign to the [[Queen-in-Parliament|Crown-in-Parliament]] ... Between Roman Catholicism and [[royal supremacy]] there is, as Saint [[Thomas More]] concluded, no reconciliation.\" Powell concluded that a Roman Catholic crown would be the destruction of the Church of England because \"it would contradict the essential character of that church.\"\n\nHe continued:\n<blockquote>When [[Thomas Hobbes]] wrote that \"the Papacy is no other than the ghost of the deceased [[Roman Empire]] sitting crowned upon the grave thereof\", he was promulgating an enormously important truth. Authority in the Roman Church is the exertion of that ''imperium'' from which England in the 16th century finally and decisively declared its national independence as the ''alter imperium'', the \"other empire\", of which [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] declared \"This realm of England is an empire\" ... It would signal the beginning of the end of the British monarchy. It would portend the eventual surrender of everything that has made us, and keeps us still, a nation.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Like the Roman: The Life of Enoch Powell]] |last=Heffer |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Heffer |year=1999 |publisher=Phoenix Giant |location=London |isbn=0-7538-0820-X |pages=810–812}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Scottish Parliament]] unanimously passed a motion in 1999 calling for the complete removal of any discrimination linked to the monarchy and the repeal of the Act of Settlement.<ref name=Scotsman2011>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/catholics_still_barred_from_throne_despite_law_change_1_1937348 |title=Catholics still barred from throne despite law change |date=28 October 2011 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |access-date=29 October 2011 |archive-date=30 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530052121/http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/catholics_still_barred_from_throne_despite_law_change_1_1937348 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The following year, ''[[The Guardian]]'' challenged the succession law in court,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/06/monarchy.claredyer |last=Dyer |first=Clare |title=A Challenge to the Crown: now is the time for change |date=6 December 2000 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=16 January 2010 }}</ref> claiming that it violated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which provides,\n<blockquote>The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth, or other status.</blockquote>\n\nAs the Convention nowhere lists the right to succeed to the Crown as a human right, the challenge was rejected.\n\n[[Adrian Hilton]], writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in 2003, defended the Act of Settlement as not \"irrational prejudice or blind bigotry\", but claimed that it was passed because \"the nation had learnt that when a Roman Catholic monarch is upon the throne, religious and civil liberty is lost.\" He points to the Pope's claiming universal jurisdiction, and Hilton argues that \"it would be intolerable to have, as the sovereign of a Protestant and free country, one who owes any allegiance to the head of any other state\" and contends that, if such situation came about, \"we will have undone centuries of common law.\" He said that because the Roman Catholic Church [[apostolicae curae|does not recognise the Church of England as an apostolic church]], a Roman Catholic monarch who abided by their faith's doctrine would be obliged to view Anglican and [[Church of Scotland]] archbishops, bishops, and clergy as part of the laity and therefore \"lacking the ordained authority to preach and celebrate the sacraments.\" (Hilton noted that the Church of Scotland's [[Presbyterian polity]] does not include bishops or archbishops.) Hilton said a Roman Catholic monarch would be unable to be crowned by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and notes that other European states have similar religious provisions for their monarchs: Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, whose constitutions compel their monarchs to be [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]; the Netherlands, which has a constitution requiring its monarchs be members of the Protestant [[House of Orange]]; and Belgium, which has a constitution that provides for the succession to be through Roman Catholic houses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200311/ai_n9341744 |last=Hilton |first=Adrian |title=The price of liberty |newspaper=[[The Spectator]] |date=8 November 2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604070506/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200311/ai_n9341744 |archive-date= 4 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, a private member's bill—the [[Succession to the Crown Bill 2004|Succession to the Crown Bill]]—was introduced in the House of Lords.

The 64x16 TRS-80 mode uses only a portion of the monitor, because the letters are the same size as the 80×25 CP/M screen. It was fixed with the redesign to a commercial product.]]\n\nThe '''Aster CT-80''' is a 1982 [[personal computer]] developed by the small [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company MCP (later renamed to Aster Computers), was sold in its first incarnation as a kit for hobbyists. Later it was sold ready to use. It consisted of several [[Eurocard (printed circuit board)|Eurocard]] [[Printed circuit board|PCB's]] with [[DIN 41612]] connectors, and a [[backplane]] all based on a [[19-inch rack]] configuration. It was the first commercially available Dutch personal/home computer.<ref>Except perhaps for the [[Holborn 9100]] computer which was a few months earlier, but which was designed and sold as a minicomputer at ten times the price of the Aster.</ref> The Aster computer could use the software written for the popular Tandy [[TRS-80]] computer while fixing many of the problems of that computer, but it could also run [[CP/M]] software, with a large amount of free memory [[CP/M#Transient_Program_Area|Transient Program Area]], (TPA) and a full 80×25 display, and it could be used as a Videotext terminal. Although the Aster was a clone of the TRS-80 Model I it was in fact more compatible with the [[TRS-80 Model III]] and ran all the software of these systems including games. It also had a built-in speaker which was compatible with such games software.\n\n==Models==\nThree models were sold. The first model (launched June 1982) looked like the [[IBM PC]], a rectangular base unit with two [[floppy]] drives on the front, and a monitor on top with a separate detachable keyboard. The second incarnation was a much smaller unit the width of two 5{{frac|1|4}}\" floppy drives stacked on top of each other, and the third incarnation looked like a flattened [[Apple II|Apple]] with a built-in keyboard.\n\nAll units ran much faster than the original [[TRS-80]], at 4 [[Megahertz|MHz]], (with a software selectable throttle to the original speed for compatibility purposes) and the display supported upper and lower case, hardware snow suppression (video ram bus arbitration logic), and an improved character font set. The floppy disk interface supported dual density, and disk capacities up to 800 [[Kilobyte|KB]], more than four times the capacity of the original TRS-80. A special version of [[NewDos/80]], (an improved [[TRS-DOS]] compatible [[Disk operating system]]) was used to support these disk capacities when using the TRS-80 compatibility mode.\n\nFor the educational market a version of the first model was produced with a new plastic enclosure (the First Asters had an all-metal enclosure) that also had an opening on the top in which a cassette recorder could be placed. This model was used in a cluster with one Aster (with disk drives) for the teacher, and eight disk less versions for the pupils. The pupils could download software from the teachers computer through a network based on a fast serial connection, as well as sending back their work to the teachers computer. There was also hardware in place through which the teacher could see the display of each pupils screen on his own monitor.\n\n==Working modes==\nThe Aster used 64 KB of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] and had the unique feature of supporting two fundamentally different internal architectures: when turned on without a boot floppy or with a TRS-DOS floppy, the Aster would be fully [[TRS-80]] compatible, with 48 KB of RAM. When the boot loader detected a [[CP/M]] floppy, the Aster would reconfigure its internal memory architecture on the fly to optimally support CP/M with 60 KB free RAM for programs ([[CP/M#Transient_Program_Area|TPA]]) and an 80 x 25 display. This dual-architecture capability only existed on one other TRS-80 clone, the [[Max-80|LOBO Max-80]].\n\nWith a special configuration tool, the CT-80 could reconfigure its floppy drivers to read and write the floppies of about 80 other CP/M systems.\n\nA third mode was entered with a special boot floppy which turned the Aster into a [[Videotex]] terminal with a 40x25 display and a Videotex character set, The software used the built in [[RS-232]] interface of the Aster to control a modem through which it could contact a Prestel service provider.\n\n==Sales==\n\nMost Aster CT-80's (about 10 thousand of them) were sold to schools for computer education, in a project first known as the \"honderd scholen project\" (one hundred schools project), but which later involved many more than just one hundred schools. MCP received this order from the Dutch government because their computer met all the technical and other demands, including the demand that the computers should be of Dutch origin and should be built in the Netherlands. Another important demand was that the computers could be used in a network (Aster developed special software and hardware for that). Later however the Government turned around and gave 50% of the order to [[Philips]] and their [[Philips P2000|P2000]] homecomputer even though the P2000 did not meet all the technical demands, was made in [[Austria]] and did not have network hardware nor software.\n\n==Company==\n\nAster computers was based in the small town of [[Arkel]] near the town of [[Gorinchem]].\nInitially Aster computer b.v. was called MCP (Music print Computer Product), because it was specialized in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music. The director of the company was interested in Microprocessor technology and noticed there was a market for selling kits to computer building amateurs, so they started selling electronic kits to hobbyists, and employed four persons at that time . They also assembled kits for people without soldering skills, especially the \"[[Elektor Junior Computer|junior Computer]]\" from [[Elektor]] (a copy of the [[KIM-1]]), and the [[ZX80]] from Sinclair. Among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for TRS-80 computers. But these needed the infamous TRS-80 expansion interface, which was very expensive, and had a very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the [[Western Digital FD1771|WD1771]] floppy disk controller chip without an external \"data separator\". To fix this problem MCP developed a small plugin board which could be plugged into the socket for the WD1771, and which contained a data separator, and a socket for the WD1791 to support dual-density operation. Still, the expansion interface was expensive and due to its design it was also unreliable. So they decided to also develop their own alternative in the form of an improved floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into a floppy disk enclosure. The lack of RAM expansion offered by this solution was solved by a service in which the 16&nbsp;KB RAM chips inside the base unit would be replaced by 64&nbsp;KB RAM chips.\nWhile this went on MCP renamed itself to ''MCP CHIP'' but ran into problems with the German computer magazine ''[[CHIP (magazine)|CHIP]]'', and had to return to its former name. At that time MCP did also sell imported home computers like the [[TRS-80]], the [[Video Genie]] (another TRS-80 clone), the [[Luxor AB|Luxor]] [[ABC 80]] and the [[Apple II]].\nThey also sold the exotic [[Olivetti M20]], a very early 16-bit personal computer that was one of the very few systems to use a [[Z8000]] CPU.\n\nAfter designing their own fully functional replacement for the TRS-80 expansion interface (which was never commercialized) the company realized that they could do better than just re-designing the expansion interface. They observed that the TRS-80 was a great computer but it lacked in several areas. The display logic and resulting display 'snow' was irritating, as was the missing lower case support, the CPU speed could be improved, the quality and layout of the keyboard was bothersome, and the floppy disk capacity and reliability was low. Also the more interesting software offered for CP/M systems could not run well on a TRS-80. So they decided to design a TRS-80 and CP/M software-compatible computer system, which (following the lead of [[Apple Computer]]) they decided to name after a \"typical Dutch flower\". So they called it the Aster CT-80 ('''C'''P/M/'''T'''andy'''-'''19'''80'''). Why they went with Aster, and not the more well known Tulip is unknown, perhaps they thought it would be to presumptuous, or perhaps the fact that \"Aster\" is also a Dutch girls' name has something to do with it. Remarkably \"Aster\" was also the name given to a Dutch [[Supercomputer]] much later, in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe first version of the Aster consisted of four \"[[Eurocard (PCB)|Eurocards]]\", one [[Z80]] CPU card with 64&nbsp;KB memory, one [[Motorola]] [[MC6845]]-based video card, one [[double density]] floppy disk controller card and one \"keyboard/RS-232/cassette interface\" card. Plus a \"backplane card\", (which connected all the other cards) and a keyboard. And was intended for hobbyists, to be sold as a kit consisting of the parts and the PCB's for the computer and attached keyboard. After selling a few kits, MCP became convinced there was a much bigger market for an improved model sold as a completed working system. However the original kit version lacked many features that prevented its use as a serious computer system. Because the original designer had left the company another employee completely redesigned most of the system, (adding a display snow remover circuit, true 80/64 column text mode support, (with different size letters for TRS-80 and CP/M mode, so that in TRS-80 mode the full screen was also used, not just a 64×16 portion of the 80×25 screen)  with an improved font set (adding \"gray scale\" version of the TRS-80 mozaik graphics and many special [[PETSCII]] like characters), and a more flexible and reliable floppy disk controller and keyboard interface plus many other small improvements), also an enclosure was developed for the main computer system, (in the form of a [[19-inch rack]] for the Eurocards) and for two floppy disk drives and the power supply. A software engineer was hired to write the special \"dual boot mode\" BIOS and the special CP/M BIOS. The \"dual boot mode\" BIOS actually discovered whether a TRS-DOS, or Aster CP/M disk was placed in the drive, and would, depending on the type of disk, reorganise the internal memory architecture of the system, to either be 100% TRS-80 compatible or optimally support CP/M, with as much \"workspace\" as possible, and the 80×25 video mode. It also was responsible for switching to ROM BASIC when the system was turned on with the break key pressed, and later supported a primitive LAN system, using the RS-232 port with modified cabling. The very first of the ready made computers were sold with the \"kit\" versions of the euro cards, the version with redesigned cards came a month or so later.\n\nSoon the little shop became much too small and they moved to a much larger factory building nearby (formerly a window glass factory), and started mass-producing the Aster for a period of a few years, in which time its staff grew twentyfold.\n\nAfter the Aster having been a few years on the Market Tandy released its own improved model, the [[TRS-80 Model III]] computer which solved many of the same problems that the Aster also had solved, but the model 3 still did not fully support CP/M as the Aster did. In the meantime IBM had released its original IBM PC, which incidentally looked remarkably like the Asters base with floppy drives + separate keyboard set-up.\n\nThe Aster was chosen for Dutch schools by the Dutch ministry of education, in a set-up with eight disk-less Asters, and one Aster with high-capacity floppy drives all connected by a LAN based on the Aster's high-speed serial port hardware, and special cables that permitted that any single computer on the LAN could broadcast to all other computers. The floppy based system was operated by the teacher who could send programs from his floppy disk, and data, to the student's disk-less systems thanks to the special BIOS in those systems. The students could send programs and data back to the teacher through the same LAN, or could save to a cassette recorder built into the disk-less units. Through a special \"video-switch\" the teacher was also able to see a copy of each student's display on his own screen. About a thousand of such systems were sold for many hundreds of Dutch schools.\n\nBecause of cash flow problems (resulting from growing too fast, insufficient financial backing, technical problems, and a sudden problem with Z80 processor deliveries) the company suddenly folded even before it came to full fruition.\n\nPerhaps the Aster computer inspired another [[Netherlands|Dutch]] computer firm to name their computer after another typical Dutch flower&mdash;the [[Tulip Computers|Tulip's]] [[Tulip System-1]] which appeared about the same time Aster folded.\n\nMost of the engineers who designed the hardware and software of the Aster went on to design hardware and software for the (then new) [[MSX]] system for a company called \"Micro Technology b.v.\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Unreleased add ons==\n\nTo enhance and modernize the Aster CT-80 the company also designed three alternative video display adapters to supplement or replace the TRS-80 compatible video card, (due to the modular nature of the Aster it was simply a matter of changing the video card, and/or CPU card to upgrade the system):\n* A very High resolution monochrome video card with [[blitter]] and hardware text line and arc drawing capability, was designed for [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] applications, based on the [[NEC μPD7220]] chip designed for graphic terminals, but was also used by some personal computers like the DEC Rainbow, and notably also for the Tulip System I.\n* A colour video card with [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] capability based on the same [[TMS9918]] video chip as the [[TI-99/4A|TI-99/4]] and [[MSX]] computers, designed for gaming, and more creative and colorful educational software. A working prototype of this card was finished.\n* A replacement card for the original TRS-80 compatible video card, software compatible to the original one, but with added color and very high resolution capabilities. was also on the drawing board. Based on a newer, slightly more flexible, version of the Asters original [[Motorola]] MC6845 video chip, the [[Conexant|Rockwell]] 6545, it worked by adding a new video mode, one with the ability to reprogram an extended, (2048 characters instead of 256 characters) version of the [[character set]], supported by an extended character memory of the video card that did not use one (8 bit) byte per character, but an 11 bit \"word\", so it could address each one of the available 2048 unique programmable characters. This meant it could provide a separate programmable character for all of the 1024 (64x16) or 2000 (80x25) characters on the screen. By filling the character pointer memory with values from zero to 1999 this essentially turned the text mode display into a very high resolution graphics mode, with the \"font memory\", acting as the high resolution [[Raster graphics]] video memory. Because the characters were 8 x 12 pixels this meant that video resolutions of 512 x 192 pixels (in 64x16 character mode), or 640 x 300 pixels (in 80x25 character mode) were created, which was quite high for the time. The \"double width\" mode of the TRS-80 was also supported, so 256 x 192 pixels (in 32x16 character mode), or 320 x 300 pixels (in 40x25 character mode)  were also possible. The video card also supported 16 foreground and 16 background colors per character, by providing one byte per character position (2K) of \"color ram\". One nibble of such a byte then controlled the foreground color, and the other nibble controlled the background color, a system very similar to the [[ZX Spectrum]], in fact in the 256x192 mode the display mode was virtually identical to the video of the ZX Spectrum. The color memory was also available in the \"normal\" TRS-80 and CP/M text modes, which meant that existing TRS-80 and CP/M software could be easily modified to add color. This video card would also support fast scrolling of high resolution color screens for games, because it had the indirection of the character pointers, so it was possible to quickly scroll the high resolution display, (or use other effects) by simply manipulating the 1920/1024 bytes of text video instead of the 24,576 bytes of high-resolution video memory.\n\nA hard disk interface was also in the works, which would, add a [[SCSI]] interface, and the necessary software. A working prototype was developed that added a 40MB hard disk.\n\nOn the software front, work was being done to implement the replacement for the aging \"user interface\" of CP/M, (the Command Console Processor [[CP/M#Console Command Processor|CCP]]) with the more modern [[ZCPR]].\n\nFinally a replacement for the aging [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor was being developed in the form of an [[Intel 8086]] board, and additional 512K 16 bit memory boards. Such replacements of CPU and memory system components were possible because the Aster CT-80 was designed to use a backplane that was designed to support both 8 and 16 bit processors, and used a modular Eurocard based design with slots to spare for expansion. In theory the system could support the Z80 and the 8086 simultaneously. Plans were formulated to support CP/M-86 and even MS-DOS.\n\nUnfortunately none of these extensions to the system became available because the company folded before any of them could be released.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200909/http://www.museo8bits.com/aster_ct80.htm Pictures of the Aster CT-80 model one from a Spanish computer museum, the educational model with an opening for a cassette player is the one on the right]\n* [http://niels.horn.tripod.com/_images/mkb_hist_1983.jpg A picture of the Aster CT-80 model two used for a business application]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111001080154/http://www.computermuseumgroningen.nl/tandy/clones/aster.jpg A picture of the Aster CT-80 model three without cover (Computermuseumgroningen does not have this item anymore)]\n* [https://www.electrickery.nl/comp/trs80/doc/VoorlopigeManualAsterCT-80.pdf Preliminary manual for the Aster CT-80 (in dutch)]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{TRS-80 and Tandy computers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aster Ct-80}}\n[[Category:Z80-based home computers]]\n[[Category:Home computers]]<!-- Leave this, otherwise navigation is impossible for those who don't know what a Z80 is -->\n[[Category:Personal computers]]\n[[Category:TRS-80]]","_bytes":18878,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2023-10-12T15:52:21Z"},"title":"Aster CT-80","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}

West Germany and France reached a firm agreement on 29 May 1969, after the British withdrew from the project on 10 April 1969. The pan-[[Europe]]an collaborative [[aerospace manufacturer]] Airbus Industrie was formally created on 18 December 1970 to develop and produce it. The A300 prototype first flew on 28 October 1972.\n\n<!--design-->\nThe first twin-engine widebody airliner, the A300 typically seats 247 passengers in two classes over a [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of 5,375 to 7,500&nbsp;km (2,900 to 4,050&nbsp;nmi; {{cvt|5,375 to 7,500|km|mi|disp=output only}}).\n<!--variants-->\nInitial variants are powered by [[General Electric CF6-50]] or [[Pratt & Whitney JT9D]] turbofans and have a three-crew flight deck.  The improved A300-600 has a two-crew cockpit and updated [[General Electric CF6-80C2|CF6-80C2]] or [[Pratt & Whitney PW4000|PW4000]] engines; it made its first flight on 8 July 1983 and entered service later that year.  The A300 is the basis of the smaller [[Airbus A310|A310]] (first flown in 1982) and was adapted in a freighter version.  Its cross section was retained for the larger four-engined [[Airbus A340|A340]] (1991) and the larger twin-engined [[Airbus A330|A330]] (1992).  It is also the basis for the oversize [[Airbus Beluga|Beluga]] transport (1994).\n\nUnlike most [[Airbus]] products, it has a [[Yoke (aeronautics) |yoke]], not using a [[fly-by-wire]] system. \n\n<!-- operational history-->\nLaunch customer [[Air France]] introduced the type on 23 May 1974.\nAfter limited demand initially, sales took off as the type was proven in early service, beginning three decades of steady orders.  It has a similar capacity to the [[Boeing 767]]-300, introduced in 1986, but lacked the 767-300ER range.  During the 1990s, the A300 became popular with [[cargo aircraft]] operators, as both passenger airliner conversions and as original builds.  Production ceased in July 2007 after 561 deliveries.\n{{As of|2023|Sep|df=US}}, there are 197 A300 family aircraft still in commercial service.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Hawker-Nord-Breguet HBN100.png|thumb|In 1966, [[Hawker Siddeley]], [[Nord Aviation]], and [[Breguet Aviation]] proposed the 260-seat [[wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] ''HBN 100'' with a similar configuration]]\n\nDuring the 1960s, European aircraft manufacturers such as [[Hawker Siddeley]] and the [[British Aircraft Corporation]], based in the UK, and [[Sud Aviation]] of France, had ambitions to build a new 200-seat airliner for the growing civil aviation market.

The saviour of the A300 was the advent of ETOPS, a revised [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] rule which allows twin-engine jets to fly long-distance routes that were previously off-limits to them.

The first inexpensive microprocessors from [[MOS Technology]] in late 1975 made this feasible. The console was prototyped as [[codename]] Stella by Atari subsidiary [[Cyan Engineering]]. Lacking funding to complete the project, Bushnell sold Atari to [[Warner Communications]] in 1976.\n\nThe Atari VCS launched in 1977 with nine simple, low-resolution games in 2 KB cartridges. The system's first [[killer application|killer app]] was the home conversion of Taito's arcade game ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in 1980. The VCS became widely successful, leading to the founding of [[Activision]] and other [[Video game developer#Third-party developers|third-party game developers]] and to competition from console manufacturers [[Mattel]] and [[Coleco]]. By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983–84, games for the 2600 were using more than four times the storage size of the launch games<ref name=horton/> with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for, such as [[Activision]]'s ''[[Pitfall!]]''\n\nBy 1982, the Atari 2600 was the dominant game system in North America. However, it saw competition from other consoles such as the [[Intellivision]] and [[ColecoVision]], and poor decisions by Atari management damaged both the system and company's reputation, most notably the release of two highly anticipated games for the 2600: a port of the arcade game ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. ''Pac-Man'' became the 2600's highest-selling game, but was panned for being inferior to the arcade version. ''E.T.'' was rushed to market for the [[economics of Christmas|holiday shopping]] season and was similarly panned and became a commercial failure. Both games, and a glut of third-party [[shovelware]], were factors in ending Atari's relevance in the console market, contributing to the [[video game crash of 1983]].\n\nWarner sold Atari's home division to former [[Commodore International|Commodore]] CEO [[Jack Tramiel]] in 1984. In 1986, the new [[Atari Corporation]] under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backward-compatible [[Atari 7800]], but it was [[Nintendo]] that led the recovery of the industry with its [[History of the Nintendo Entertainment System#North American launch (1985-1986)|1985 launch]] of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Production of the Atari 2600 ended on January 1, 1992, with an estimated 30 million units sold across its lifetime.\n\n==History==\n{{VG timeline\n|title=Atari VCS/2600 timeline\n|align=right\n|range1=1972:1976\n|range1_color=#FFFF01 #999900\n|range2=1977:1985\n|range2_color=#0CEB51 #229B22\n|range3=1986:1992\n|range3_color=#99FFFF #006666\n|1972=Formation of [[Atari, Inc.]]\n|1974=Acquisition of [[Cyan Engineering]]\n|1975=Debut of the [[MOS 6502]]\n|1976=Sale of Atari to [[Warner Communications]]\n|1977=Launch of Atari VCS\n|1979=Formation of [[Activision]]\n|1980=Release of ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Adventure (1980 video game)|Adventure]]''\n|1981=First bank-switched game: ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''\n|1982a=Rebranding to Atari 2600 (November)\n|1982b=Release of ''Pac-Man'' and ''E.T.''\n|1983=[[Video game crash of 1983]]\n|1984=Sale of [[Atari]] to [[Jack Tramiel]]\n|1986=Release of Atari 2600 Jr.\n|1990=Final game from Atari: ''[[Klax (video game)|Klax]]''\n|1992=Discontinuation\n}}\n\nAtari, Inc. was founded by [[Nolan Bushnell]] and [[Ted Dabney]] in 1972.

The competition along with other missteps by Atari led to financial problems in 1974, though recovering by the end of the year.<ref name=\"gamasutra history atari\"/> By 1975, Atari had released a [[Home Pong|''Pong'' home console]], competing against [[Magnavox]], the only other major producer of home consoles at the time. Atari engineers recognized, however, the limitation of custom [[logic programming|logic]] integrated onto the circuit board, permanently confining the whole console to only one game.<ref name=\"gamespy history p. 1\">{{cite web | url = http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&id=401 | title = The 2600 Story – Part I | first = Marty | last = Goldberg | date = January 4, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131013220343/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&id=401 | archive-date = October 13, 2013 | access-date = September 11, 2018 | work = [[GameSpy]] }}</ref> The increasing competition increased the risk, as Atari had found with past arcade games and again with dedicated home consoles. Both platforms are built from integrating discrete electro-mechanical components into circuits, rather than programmed as on a [[mainframe computer]]. Therefore, development of a console had cost at least {{US$|100000|1975|about=yes|round=-3|long=no}} plus time to complete, but the final product only had about a three-month shelf life until becoming outdated by competition.<ref name=\"gamasutra history atari\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130414/the_history_of_atari_19711977.php?print=1 | title = The History of Atari: 1971–1977 | first = Steve | last = Fulton | date = November 6, 2007 | access-date = September 11, 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-date = September 12, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180912021902/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130414/the_history_of_atari_19711977.php?print=1 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nBy 1974, Atari had acquired [[Cyan Engineering]], a [[Grass Valley, California|Grass Valley]] electronics company founded by Steve Mayer and Larry Emmons, both former colleagues of Bushnell and Dabney from [[Ampex]], who helped to develop new ideas for Atari's arcade games. Even prior to the release of the home version of ''Pong'', Cyan's engineers, led by Mayer and Ron Milner, had envisioned a home console powered by new programmable [[microprocessor]]s capable of playing Atari's current arcade offerings.

In his final report, Landrum suggested a living room aesthetic, with a [[wood grain]] finish, and the cartridges must be \"idiot proof, child proof and effective in resisting potential static [electricity] problems in a living room environment\".<ref name=\"atari fun chp5\"/> Landrum recommended it include four to five dedicated games in addition to the cartridges, but this was dropped in the final designs.<ref name=\"atari fun chp5\"/> The cartridge design was done by James Asher and Douglas Hardy. Hardy had been an engineer for Fairchild and helped in the initial design of the Channel F cartridges, but he quit to join Atari in 1976.

Therefore, to connect to a TV, the console generates a [[radio frequency]] signal compatible with the regional television standards ([[NTSC]], [[PAL]], or [[SECAM]]), using a special switch box to act as the television's antenna.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arceneaux |first1=Noah |title=Review Article: Game theories, technologies and techniques of play |journal=New Media & Society |date=19 February 2010 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=161–166 |doi=10.1177/1461444809350996|s2cid=220595570 }}</ref><ref name=\"ieee decuir\"/>\n\nAtari developed the [[Television Interface Adaptor]] (TIA) chip in the VCS to handle the graphics and conversion to a television signal. It provides a single-color, 20-bit background register that covers the left half of the screen (each bit represents 4 adjacent pixels) and is either repeated or reflected on the right side. There are 5 single-color [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]: two 8-pixel wide ''players''; two 1 bit ''missiles'', which share the same colors as the players; and a 1-pixel ''ball'', which shares the background color.

The background and [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] apply to a single [[scan line]], and as the display is output to the television, the program can change colors, sprite positions, and background settings. The careful timing required to sync the code to the screen on the part of the programmer was labeled \"[[racing the beam]]\"; the actual game logic runs when the television beam is outside of the visible area of the screen.{{sfn|Montfort|Bogost|2009}}<ref name=\"Wired racing\"/> Early games for the system use the same visuals for pairs of scan lines, giving a lower vertical resolution, to allow more time for the next row of graphics to be prepared.

The 5200's controllers have an analog [[joystick]] and a [[numeric keypad]] along with start, pause, and reset buttons. The 360-degree non-centering joystick was touted as offering more control than the eight-way [[Atari CX40 joystick]] of the 2600, but was a focal point for criticism.\n\nOn May 21, 1984, during a press conference at which the [[Atari 7800]] was introduced, company executives revealed that the 5200 had been discontinued after less than two years on the market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sanger|first=David E.|date=May 22, 1984|title=Atari Video Game Unit Introduced|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/22/business/atari-video-game-unit-introduced.html|url-access=limited|journal=New York Times|page=3 (Section D)|quote=Company officials disclosed for the first time yesterday that the 5200 is no longer in production, and Atari appears to be selling off its inventory.}}</ref> Total sales of the 5200 were reportedly in excess of 1&nbsp;million units,<ref name=\"schrage1984\"/> far short of its predecessor's sales of over 30&nbsp;million.\n\n==Hardware==\n[[File:Atari-5200-4-Port-Console-Open-wControllers.jpg|thumb|The 5200's large size is due in part to controller storage in the back of the unit.]]\n[[File:Atari-5200-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|The second revision of the 5200]]\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2014}}\nMuch of the technology in the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of [[home computer]] was originally developed as a second-generation games console intended to replace the [[Atari 2600|Atari Video Computer System]] console. However, as the system was reaching completion, the personal computer revolution was starting with the release of machines like the [[Commodore PET]], [[TRS-80]], and [[Apple II series|Apple II]]. These machines had less advanced hardware than the new Atari technology, but sold for much higher prices with associated higher profit margins. Atari's management decided to enter this market, and the technology was repackaged into the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 400 and 800]]. The chipset used in these machines was created with the mindset that the VCS would likely be obsolete by 1980.\n\nAtari later decided to re-enter the games market with a design that closely matched their original 1978 specifications. In its prototype stage, the Atari 5200 was originally called the \"Atari Video System X – Advanced Video Computer System\", and was codenamed \"Pam\" after a female employee at [[Atari, Inc.]] It is also rumored that PAM actually stood for \"Personal Arcade Machine\", as the majority of games for the system ended up being arcade conversions. Actual working ''Atari Video System X'' machines, whose hardware is 100% identical to the Atari 5200 do exist, but are extremely rare.<ref name=\"vsx\">{{cite web |author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/vsx.html |title=Video System X |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |access-date=January 12, 2011 |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130117121835/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/vsx.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe initial 1982 release of the system featured four controller ports, where nearly all other systems of the day had only one or two ports. The 5200 also featured a new style of controller with an analog [[joystick]], numeric keypad, two fire buttons on each side of the controller and game function keys for Start, Pause, and Reset. The 5200 also featured the innovation of the first automatic TV switchbox, allowing it to automatically switch from regular TV viewing to the game system signal when the system was activated. Previous RF adapters required the user to slide a switch on the adapter by hand. The [[radio frequency|RF]] box was also where the power supply connected in a unique dual power/television signal setup similar to the [[RCA Studio II]]'s. A single cable coming out of the 5200 plugged into the switch box and carried both electricity and the television signal.\n\nThe 1983 revision of the Atari 5200 has two controller ports instead of four, and a change back to the more conventional separate power supply and standard non-autoswitching RF switch. It also has changes in the cartridge port address lines to allow for the [[Atari 2600]] adapter released that year. While the adapter was only made to work on the two-port version, modifications can be made to the four-port to make it line-compatible. In fact, towards the end of the four-port model's production run, there were a limited number of consoles produced which included these modifications. These consoles can be identified by an asterisk in their serial numbers.\n\nAt one point following the 5200's release, Atari planned a smaller, cost-reduced version of the Atari 5200, which removed the controller storage bin. Code-named the \"Atari 5100\" (a.k.a. \"Atari 5200 Jr.\"), only a few fully working prototype 5100s were made before the project was canceled.<ref>{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5100/5100.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130117055530/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5100/5100.html |url-status=live |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |title=5100/5200 Jr |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |access-date=January 12, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Controllers===\n[[File:Atari-5200-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Atari 5200 controller included with the console]]\n[[File:Atari-5200-Trak-Ball-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Pro-Line Track Ball controller]]\nThe controller prototypes used in the electrical development lab employed a yoke-and-gimbal mechanism that came from an RC airplane controller kit. The design of the [[analog stick|analog joystick]], which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to provide centering, proved to be ungainly and unreliable. They quickly became the [[Achilles' heel]] of the system due to the combination of an overly complex mechanical design and a very low-cost internal flex circuit system.<ref name=\"atarimuseum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/A5200.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030808134516/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/A5200.html |url-status=live |archive-date=August 8, 2003 |title=The Atari 5200 Super System |publisher=atarimuseum.com |access-date=July 6, 2014 }}</ref> Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not translate into a linear acceleration from the center through the arc of the stick travel.

Software designed for one does not run on the other, but source code can be mechanically converted unless it uses computer-specific features. ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' magazine reported in 1984 that \"the similarities grossly outweigh the differences, so that a 5200 program can be developed and almost entirely debugged [on an Atari 8-bit computer] before testing on a 5200\".<ref name=\"converting\" /> [[John J.

Instead of a limited number of hardware sprites, MARIA treats everything as a sprite described in a series of [[display list]]s. Each display list contains pointers to graphics data and color and positioning information.\n\nMARIA supports a palette of 256 colors and graphics modes which are either 160 pixels wide or 320 pixels wide. While the 320 pixel modes theoretically enable the 7800 to create games at higher resolution than the 256 pixel wide graphics found in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Master System]], the processing demands of MARIA result in most games using the 160 pixel mode.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nEach sprite can have from 1 to 12 colors, with 3 colors plus transparency being the most common. In this format, the sprite references one of 8 palettes, where each palette holds 3 colors. The background–visible when not covered by other objects–can also be assigned a color. In total, 25 colors can appear on a [[scan line]].<ref name=3600sg/>\n\nThe graphics resolution, color palettes, and background color can be adjusted between scan lines.<ref name=3600sg>{{cite web |title=Atari 3600 Software Guide |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/ahs_archives/archives/pdf/videogames/7800/3600_software_guide.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207033819/http://www.atarimuseum.com/ahs_archives/archives/pdf/videogames/7800/3600_software_guide.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-07 }}</ref> This can be used to render high resolution text in one area of the screen, while displaying more colorful graphics at lower resolution in the gameplay area.\n\n=== Sound ===\nThe 7800 uses the TIA chip for two channel audio, the same chip used in the 1977 Atari VCS, and the sound is of the same quality as that system. To compensate, GCC's engineers allowed games to include a [[POKEY|POKEY audio chip]] in the cartridge. Only ''[[Ballblazer]]'' and ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'' do this.\n\nGCC planned to make a low-cost, high performance sound chip, GUMBY, which could also be placed in 7800 cartridges to enhance its sound capabilities further.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} This project was cancelled when Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel.\n\n=== Digitally signed cartridges ===\nFollowing the large number of low quality, third party games for the Atari 2600, Atari required that cartridges for the 7800 be digitally signed. When a cartridge is inserted into the system, the BIOS generates a signature of the cartridge ROM and compares it to the one stored on the cartridge. If they match, the console operates in 7800 mode, granting the game access to MARIA and other features, otherwise the console operates as a 2600. This digital signature code is not present in PAL 7800s, which use various heuristics to detect 2600 cartridges, due to export restrictions.\n\n=== Backward compatibility ===\nThe 7800's compatibility with the Atari 2600 is made possible by including many of the same chips used in the 2600. When playing an Atari 2600 game, the 7800 uses a Television Interface Adaptor chip to generate graphics and sound. The processor is slowed to 1.19&nbsp;MHz, to mirror the performance of the 2600's 6507 chip. RAM is limited to 128 bytes and cartridge data is accessed in 4K blocks.\n\nWhen in 7800 mode (signified by the appearance of the full-screen Atari logo), the graphics are generated entirely by the MARIA graphics processing unit. All system RAM is available and cartridge data is accessed in larger 48K blocks. The system's SALLY 6502 runs at its normal 1.79&nbsp;MHz. The 2600 chips are used to generate sound and to provide the interfaces to the controllers and console switches.\n\n===System revisions===\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=August 2021}}\n*Initial version: two joystick ports on lower front panel. Side expansion port for upgrades and add-ons. Bundled with two CX24 Pro-Line joysticks, AC adapter, switchbox, RCA connecting cable, and ''[[Pole Position II]]'' cartridge.\n*Second revision: Slightly revised motherboard.

The Pro-Line was developed for the 2600 and advertised in 1983,<ref>{{cite web |title=Catalog - Atari (CO21776-Rev. A) |url=https://atariage.com/catalog_thumbs.php?CatalogID=38 |website=AtariAge }}</ref> but delayed until Atari proceeded with the 7800. The right fire button only works as a separate fire button for certain 7800 games; otherwise, it duplicates the left fire button, allowing either button to be used for 2600 games. While physically compatible, the 7800's controllers do not work with the [[Master System|Sega Master System]], and Sega's controllers are unable to use the 7800's two-button mode.\n\nIn response to criticism over ergonomic issues with the Pro-Line controllers, Atari later released a joypad controller with the European 7800.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Game Machines|pages=138}}</ref> Similar in style to controllers found on Nintendo and Sega systems, it was not available in the United States.\n\nThe [[Atari XG-1 light gun]], bundled with the [[Atari XEGS]] and also sold separately, is compatible with the 7800. Atari released five 7800 light gun games: ''[[Alien Brigade]]'', ''[[Barnyard Blaster]]'', ''[[Crossbow (video game)|Crossbow]]'', ''[[Meltdown (Atari 7800)|Meltdown]]'', and ''Sentinel''.\n\n=== Cancelled peripherals ===\nAfter the acquisition of the Atari Consumer Division by [[Jack Tramiel]] in 1984, several expansion options for the system were cancelled:\n\n* The High Score Cartridge was designed to save high scores for up to 65 separate games.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8YlaRclj2gC&dq=The+High+Score+Cartridge+was+designed+to+save+high+scores+for+up+to+65+separate+games&pg=PA139 |title=The Games Machine |page=139 |date=December 2019}} </ref> The cartridge was intended as a pass-through device, similar to the later [[Game Genie]]. Nine games were programmed to support the cartridge.\n* The expansion port, to allow for the addition of a planned computer keyboard and connection to laserdisc players and other peripherals, was removed in the second and third revisions of the 7800.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Atari Compendium|url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/game_library/easter_eggs/7800/78prosystem.html}}</ref>\n* A dual joystick holder was designed for ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'' and future games like ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'', but not produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210724013905/https://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/ |archive-date=24 July 2021 |title=Cartridge Consoles |website=Atari Museum}}</ref>\n\n== Games ==\n{{Main|List of Atari 7800 games|List of Atari 2600 games}}\n[[File:Atari 7800 with Cartridge.jpg|thumb|Atari 7800 with ''Donkey Kong Junior'' cartridge]]\n\nWhile the system can play the over 400 games for the Atari 2600, there were only 59 official releases  for the 7800.

A raster graphics version of 1979's ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' was released in 1987. In 1988, Atari published a conversion of Nintendo's ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', seven years after the original arcade game and five years after the [[Atari 8-bit family]] cartridge.  Atari also marketed a line of games called \"Super Games\" which were arcade and computer games previously not playable on a home console such as [[One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird|One-On-One Basketball]] and [[Impossible Mission]].<ref>http://www.tankgirl.info/8bit/images/atari/7800/boxBottom.jpg</ref>\n\nEleven games were developed and sold by three third-party companies under their own labels ([[Absolute Entertainment]], [[Activision]], and [[Froggo]]) with the rest published by Atari Corporation. Most of the games from Atari were developed by outside companies under contract.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jung|first1=Robert A.|title=The Atari Timeline|url=https://www.landley.net/history/mirror/atari/museum/Atari-Timeline.html|website=Landley|access-date=13 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome NES games were developed by companies who had licensed their title from a different arcade manufacturer. While the creator of the NES version would be restricted from making a competitive version of an NES game, the original arcade copyright holder was not precluded from licensing out rights for a home version of an arcade game to multiple systems. Through this loophole, Atari 7800 conversions of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Double Dragon]]'', ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'', ''[[Rampage (video game)|Rampage]]'', ''[[Xenophobe (video game)|Xenophobe]]'', ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'', and ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' were licensed and developed.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nA final batch of games was released by Atari in 1990: ''[[Alien Brigade]]'', ''[[Basketbrawl]]'', ''[[Fatal Run]]'', ''[[Meltdown (Atari 7800)|Meltdown]]'', ''[[Midnight Mutants]]'', ''[[MotorPsycho (Atari 7800 video game)|MotorPsycho]]'', ''[[Ninja Golf]]'', ''[[Planet Smashers (Atari 7800 video game)|Planet Smashers]]'', and ''[[Scrapyard Dog]]''. ''Scrapyard Dog'' was later released for the [[Atari Lynx]].\n\n==Legacy==\n===Atari Flashback===\nIn 2004, the [[Infogrames Entertainment, SA|Infogrames]]-owned version of Atari released the [[Atari Flashback]] console. It resembles a miniature Atari 7800 and has five 7800 and fifteen 2600 games built-in. Built using the [[Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone|NES-On-A-Chip]] hardware instead of recreating the Atari 7800 hardware, it was criticized for failing to properly replicate the actual gaming experience. A subsequent 7800 project was cancelled after prototypes were made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacyengineer.com/portfolio-7800.html |title=Remake of the Atari 7800 console |access-date=2010-12-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311035331/http://www.legacyengineer.com/portfolio-7800.html |archive-date=2011-03-11 }} Legacy 7800 remade</ref>\n\n===Game development===\nThe digital signature long prevented aftermarket games from being developed.

Prior to the Acts of Union, there had been three previous attempts (in 1606, 1667, and 1689) to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.\n\nThe Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], based in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in London, the previous home of the English Parliament.<ref>[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]], Article 3</ref> This specific process is sometimes referred to as the \"union of the Parliaments\" in Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-05-20 |title=Glossary |url=https://archive2021.parliament.scot/help/769_928.aspx |access-date=2023-01-14 |website=archive2021.parliament.scot}}</ref>\n\n==Political background prior to 1707==\n===1603–1660===\nPrior to 1603, England and Scotland had different monarchs; as [[Elizabeth I]] never married, after 1567, her heir-presumptive became the Stuart king of Scotland, [[James VI and I|James VI]], who was brought up as a Protestant. After her death, the two Crowns were held in personal union by James, as James I of England, and James VI of Scotland. He announced his intention to unite the two realms so he would not be \"guilty of bigamy\", and to give a British character to his court and person.{{sfn|Lockyer|1998|pp=51–52}}\n\nThe 1603 [[Union of England and Scotland Act 1603|Union of England and Scotland Act]] established a joint Commission to agree terms, but the [[English Parliament]] was concerned this would lead to the imposition of an [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] structure similar to that of Scotland.

The Scots remained neutral when the [[First English Civil War]] began in 1642, before becoming concerned at the impact on Scotland of a Royalist victory.{{sfn|Kaplan|1970|pp=50–70}} Presbyterian leaders like [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Argyll]] viewed union as a way to ensure free trade between England and Scotland, and preserve a Presbyterian kirk.{{sfn|Robertson|2014|p=125}}\n\n[[File:The Solemn League And Covenant.jpg|thumb|left|The 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]] between England and Scotland]]\n\nUnder the 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]], the Covenanters agreed to provide military support for the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]], in return for religious union. Although the treaty referred repeatedly to 'union' between England, Scotland, and Ireland, it did not explicitly commit to political union.\n\nThe Scots and English Presbyterians were political conservatives, who increasingly viewed the Independents, and associated radical groups like the [[Levellers]], as a bigger threat than the Royalists. Both Royalists and Presbyterians agreed monarchy was divinely ordered, but disagreed on the nature and extent of Royal authority over the church.

Developing a closer economic partnership with England was unsustainable, and Scotland's main trade partner was continental Europe, especially the [[Netherlands]], where Scotland could trade its wool and fish for luxurious imports such as iron, spices or wine. Scotland and England were generally hostile to each other and were often at war, and the [[Auld Alliance|alliance with France]] gave Scotland privileges that further encouraged developing cultural and economic ties with the continent rather than England. The union of 1603 only served the political and dynastic ambitions of [[James VI and I|King James]] and was detrimental to Scotland economically – exports that Scotland offered were largely irrelevant to English economy, and while the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] did keep its ability to manage internal economic policy, the foreign policy of Scotland was now in English hands. This limited Scotland's hitherto expansive trade with continental Europe, and forced it into English wars.<ref name=\"smout\">{{cite journal |last=Smout |first=Thomas Christopher |author-link=Christopher Smout |date=1964 |title=The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707 {{!}} I. The Economic Background|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2592848 |journal=The Economic History Review |volume=16 |number=3 |pages=455–467 |publisher=Wiley on behalf of the Economic History Society |jstor=2592848 }}\n</ref>\n\nWhile the Scottish economy already suffered because of English wars with France and Spain in 1620s, the [[English Civil War|civil wars in England]] had a particularly disastrous effect on Scotland and left it relatively impoverished as a result. The economy would slowly recover after that, but it came at the cost of being increasingly dependent on trade with England. A power struggle developed between Scotland and England in 1680s, as Scotland recovered from the political turmoil and set on its own economic ambitions, which London considered a threat to its dominant and well-established position.<ref name=\"smout\"/> English wars with continental powers undermined Scottish trade with France and the Netherlands, countries that used to be the Scotland's main trade partners before the union, and the English [[Navigation Acts]] severely limited Scottish ability to trade by sea, and made the Scottish ambitions to expand the trade beyond Europe unachievable. Opinion in Scotland at the time was that England was sabotaging Scottish economic expansion.<ref name=\"smout\"/>\n\nThe frustration caused by economic and political rivalry with England led to the [[Darien scheme]] - an unsuccessful attempt to establish a Scottish colony in the [[Gulf of Darién]]. Christopher Smout argues that the scheme was successfully sabotaged by England in various ways - it was seen as a threat to the privileged position of the [[East India Company]], and as such England did everything to ensure the plan's failure via political and diplomatic overtures to prevent the Netherlands and [[Hamburg]] from investing into the scheme while also refusing to assist the settlers in any way. Following the disastrous failure of the scheme, Scottish economy seemed to be on the brink of collapse, but ultimately Scotland was able to recover from it fairly quickly.<ref name=\"smout\"/>\n\nBy 1703, the Scottish government was highly disillusioned and unsatisfied with the union, and many believed that the only way to let Scottish economy flourish was to separate from England. [[Andrew Fletcher (patriot)|Fletcher of Saltoun]] called Scotland 'totally neglected, like a farm managed by servants not under the eye of the master', and the failure of the Darien Scheme was commonly attributed to English sabotage.<ref name=\"smout\"/> The Scottish parliament would try to establish its autonomy from England with [[Act of Security 1704|1704 Act of Security]], which provoked a retaliation from England - Scottish ministers were bribed, and [[Alien Act 1705]] was passed. According to the Alien Act, unless Scotland appointed commissioners to negotiate for union by Christmas, every Scot in England would be treated as an alien, leading to the confiscation of their English estates. Additionally, Scottish wares were to be banned from England. Christopher Smout notes that England desired to expand its influence by annexing Scotland:\n\n{{blockquote|text=In sum, England was now seeking Parliamentary Union for political reasons at a moment when the Scots had become dissatisfied with Regal Union for economic reasons: and one of the main weapons chosen by the English to enforce their will was the threat of economic sanctions. The repeal of the Alien Act before it could come into force scarcely reduced its menace: a big stick is a big stick, even if it is replaced in the cupboard unused.<ref name=\"smout\" />}}\n\nThe act sparked vehement anti-English sentiment in Scotland, and made the already hostile Scottish public even more opposed to England:\n\n{{blockquote|text=The crew of an English East Indiaman, the Worcester, that had put into Leith to escape a storm was arrested on a spurious charge of piracy and executed after a parody of a trial, victims of a wave of anti-English hysteria which the Ministers of the Crown dared not be seen to oppose. As late as June, the Scottish Uniornist Cockburn of Ormiston declared he could not find ten men in Parliament willing to join England in a full Union - an exaggeration no doubt, but an indication of the contemporary force of feeling.<ref name=\"smout\" />}}\n\nThe Scottish economy was now facing a crisis, and the parliament was polarised into a pro-union and anti-union factions, with the former led by [[Daniel Defoe]]. The unionists stressed how important trade with England is to the Scottish economy, and portrayed trade with continental Europe as not beneficial, or nowhere as profitable as trading with England. They argued that the Scottish economy could survive by trading with England, and sanctions that would result from the Alien Act would collapse the economy. For Defoe, joining the union would not only prevent the Alien Act, but would also remove additional limitations and regulations, which could lead Scotland to prosperity. Anti-unionists questioned the English goodwill and criticised the unionist faction for submitting to the English blackmail. They argued that Scotland could make a recovery by trading with the Netherlands, Spain and Norway, with the diverse European markets allowing Scotland to diversify its own industries as well. They noted that the union would make Scotland unable to conduct independent trade policy, meaning that any possibility to remove the flaws in Scottish economy would be gone forever, which would turn Scotland into a \"mere satellite of the richer kingdom\".<ref name=\"smout\" /> Ultimately, Scottish ministers voted in favour of the union, which was against the public opinion, as the Scottish population at the time was overwhelmingly against any union with England.<ref name=\"Bowie\"/> Many considered themselves betrayed by their own elite, and Smout argues that the union bill was only able to pass thanks to the English bribery.<ref name=\"smout\" />\n\n== 300th anniversary ==\n\n[[File:2007£2union.jpg|thumb|The £2 coin issued in the United Kingdom in 2007 to commemorate the 300th

This connection can also be [[genlock]]ed to an external video signal. The system was bundled with an [[RF modulator|RF adapter]] to provide output on televisions with a coaxial RF input, while monochrome video is available via an [[RCA connector]] (also coaxial). On the left side, behind a plastic cover, there is a Zorro (Zorro I) bus expansion external edge connector with 86 pins. Peripherals such as a hard disk drive can be added via the expansion slot and are configured automatically by the Amiga's [[AutoConfig]] standard, so that multiple devices do not conflict with each other. Up to {{val|8 |u=MB}}{{efn|name=binpre}} of so-called \"fast RAM\" (memory that can be accessed by the CPU only) can be added using the side expansion slot. This connector is electronically identical with the Amiga 1000's, but swapped on the other side.\n\nThe Amiga 500 has a \"trap-door\" slot on the underside for a RAM upgrade (typically {{val|512 |u=KB}}){{efn|name=binpre}}. This extra RAM is classified as \"fast\" RAM, but is sometimes referred to as \"slow\" RAM: due to the design of the expansion bus, it is actually on the chipset bus. Such upgrades usually include a battery-backed [[real-time clock]]. All versions of the A500 can have the additional RAM configured as chip RAM by a simple hardware modification, which involves fitting a later model (8372A) [[MOS Technology Agnus|Agnus]] chip. Likewise, all versions of the A500 can be upgraded to {{val|2 |u=MB}}{{efn|name=binpre}} chip RAM by fitting the {{nowrap|8372B Agnus}} chip and adding additional memory.\n\nThe Amiga 500 also sports an unusual feature for a budget machine, socketed chips, which allow easy replacement of defective chips. The CPU can be directly upgraded on the motherboard to a [[Motorola 68010|68010]]; or to a [[Motorola 68020|68020]], [[Motorola 68030|68030]], or [[Motorola 68040|68040]] via the side expansion slot; or by removing the CPU and plugging a CPU expansion card into the CPU socket (this requires opening the computer and thus voided any remaining warranty).  In fact, all the custom chips can be upgraded to the [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) versions.\n\nThe plastic case is made of [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]], or ABS. ABS degrades with time due to exposure to oxygen, causing a yellowing of the case. Other factors contributing to the degradation and yellowing include heat, shear, and ultraviolet light. The yellowing can be reversed by using an [[optical brightener]], though without [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizing agents]] or antioxidants to block oxygen, the yellowing will return.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/mar/04/gadgets|title=What does it take to clean my old computer?|last=Johnson|first=Bobbie|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 4, 2009|access-date=November 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211124094207/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/mar/04/gadgets|archive-date=November 24, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Plastics Additives: An A-Z reference|last=Pritchard|first=Geoffrey|series=Polymer Science and Technology Series |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|date=1998|volume=1 |pages=55–56, 472–473|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-5862-6|isbn=978-94-011-5862-6}}</ref>\n\n== Technical specifications ==\n[[File:Amiga 1.3 and disks.jpg|thumb|right|The standard Amiga 500 requires floppies to boot]]\n\n* [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]] (1.2 and 1.3 models) or [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] (1.3 and 500+ 2.04 models) chipset.

The Amiga can show multiple resolution modes at the same time, splitting the screen vertically.\n* [[Planar (computer graphics)|Planar]] graphics are used, with up to five bitplanes (four in hires); this allowed 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 colour screens, from a palette of 4096 colours. \n* Two special graphics modes are also included: \n** [[Amiga Halfbrite mode|Extra Half Brite]] (EHB), which uses a sixth bitplane as a mask that halved the brightness of any colour seen\n** [[Hold-And-Modify]] (HAM), which allows all 4096 colours on screen at once. HAM makes it possible to use {{nowrap|12 bpp}} over a {{nowrap|3 [[pixel]]}} wide span. This works by letting each pixel position use the previous RGB value and modify one of the red, green or blue values to a new 4-bit value. This will cause some negligible colour artifacts however.\n\n=== Memory ===\nUsing various expansion techniques, the A500's total RAM can reach up to 138&nbsp;MB – 2&nbsp;MB Chip RAM, 8&nbsp;MB 16-bit Fast RAM, and 128&nbsp;MB 32-bit Fast RAM.{{efn|name=binpre}}\n\n==== Chip RAM ====\nThe stock 512&nbsp;KB Chip RAM can be complemented by 512&nbsp;KB using a \"trapdoor\" expansion (Commodore A501 or compatible).{{efn|name=binpre}} While that expansion memory is connected to the chip bus, hardware limitations of early stock Agnus chip revisions prevent its use as Chip RAM, only the CPU can access it. Suffering from the same contention limitations as Chip RAM, that memory is known as \"Slow RAM\" or \"Pseudo-fast RAM\". Agnus revisions shipped with late A500 are [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] and allow use of trapdoor RAM as real Chip RAM for a total 1&nbsp;MB.{{efn|name=binpre}} \n\nAdditionally, several third-party expansions exist with up to 2&nbsp;MB{{efn|name=binpre}} on the trapdoor board. Using a [[Amiga custom chips#Gary|Gary]] adapter, that memory will be mapped as either split on Chip RAM and Slow RAM or fully as Slow RAM, depending on configuration.\n\nFurthermore, using an [[Amiga 3000|A3000]] Agnus on an adapter board, it is possible to expand the Chip RAM to 2&nbsp;MB, matching the A500+.{{efn|name=binpre}}\n\n==== Fast RAM ====\n\"Fast\" RAM is located on the CPU-side bus. Its access is exclusive to the CPU and not slowed by any chipset access. The side expansion port allows for up to 8&nbsp;MB{{efn|name=binpre}} of [[Zorro II|Zorro-style]] expansion RAM. Alternatively, a CPU adapter allows for internal expansion.\n\n==== Accelerator RAM ====\nInternal or external CPU accelerators often include their own expansion memory. 16-bit CPUs are limited by the 24-bit address space but they can repurpose otherwise unused memory space for their included RAM. 32-bit CPU accelerators aren't limited by 24-bit addressing and can include up to 128&nbsp;MB{{efn|name=binpre}} of Fast RAM (and potentially more).\n\n==== Memory map ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Amiga system memory map{{Sfn|Greenley|Green|Baker|1991|p=314}}<ref>http://oscomp.hu/depot/amiga_memory_map.html</ref>\n|-\n!

The A500+ featured minor changes to the motherboard to make it cheaper to produce than the original A500. It was notable for introducing new versions of [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] and [[AmigaOS|Workbench]], and for some minor improvements in the custom chips, known as the [[Enhanced Chip Set]] (or ECS).\n\nAlthough officially introduced in 1992, some Amiga 500 units sold in late 1991 actually featured the revised motherboard used in the A500+. Although the Amiga 500+ was an improvement to the Amiga 500, it was minor. It was discontinued and replaced by the [[Amiga 600]] in summer 1992, making it the shortest-lived Amiga model.\n\n=== Compatibility problems ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2021}}\nDue to the new Kickstart v2.04, quite a few popular games (such as ''[[Treasure Island Dizzy]]'', ''[[Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge]]'', and ''[[SWIV]]'') failed to work on the Amiga 500+, and some people took them back to dealers demanding an original Kickstart 1.3 Amiga 500. This problem was largely solved by third parties who produced Kickstart [[Read-only memory|ROM]] switching boards, that could allow the Amiga 500+ to be downgraded to Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3. It also encouraged game developers to use better programming habits, which was important since Commodore already had plans for the introduction of the next-generation [[Amiga 1200]] computer. A program, Relokick, was also released (and included with an issue of CU Amiga) which loaded a [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] 1.3 ROM image into memory and booted the machine into Kickstart 1.3, allowing most incompatible software to run (the software did take up 512 KB of system memory, meaning that some 1 MB only games would now  fail for lack of available memory). In some cases, updated compatible versions of games were later released, such as budget versions of Lotus 1 and SWIV, and an update to ''[[Bubble Bobble]]''. Double Dragon 2 by Binary Design received an update for ECS machines with the \"Amiga phase-alternated linescan version 4.01/ECS\". This solved compatibility issues with the graphics which appeared garbled on ECS machines, and it also slashed the in-game loading times from around 20 seconds to just over 6.\n\n=== Technical specifications ===\n* [[Motorola 68000]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] running at {{nowrap|7.09 MHz}} (PAL) / {{nowrap|7.16 MHz}} (NTSC), like its predecessor\n* 1 MB of [[Chip RAM]] (very early versions came with 512&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KB]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}})\n* Kickstart 2.04 (v37.175)\n* Workbench 37.67 (release 2.04)\n* Built-in battery backed RTC (Real Time Clock)\n* Full [[Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] chipset including new version of the [[MOS Technology Agnus|Agnus]] chip and [[Original Amiga chipset#Denise|Denise]] chip\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Amiga}}\n* [[Amiga models and variants]]\n* [[Minimig]]{{snd}}an [[open-source hardware]] [[field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] implementation\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Introduction to the Amiga 500|1987}}|url=https://archive.org/details/Introduction_To_The_Amiga_500_v1.3.2_1987_Commodore_315839-15|title=Introduction To The Amiga 500|publisher=[[Commodore International]]|date=1987|access-date=November 24, 2021}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/amiga-hardware-reference-manual-3rd-edition|title=Amiga Hardware Reference Manual|edition=Third|last1=Greenley|first1=Larry|last2=Green|first2=Mark|last3=Baker|first3=Dan|publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]]|date=August 1991|access-date=November 24, 2021|isbn=0-201-56776-8}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Technical Reference Manual|1987}}|url=https://archive.org/details/Commodore_Amiga_A500_A2000_Technical_Reference_Manual_1987_Commodore|title=Commodore Amiga A500/A2000 Technical Reference Manual|publisher=[[Commodore International]]|date=1987|access-date=November 25, 2021}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|ROM Kernel Reference Manual|1990}}|url=https://archive.org/details/amiga-rom-kernal-reference-manual-libraries-and-devices|title=Amiga ROM Kernal Reference Manual: Libraries And Devices|edition=2nd|author=[[Commodore International]]|publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]]|date=June 1990|access-date=November 25, 2021|isbn=0-201-18187-8}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr74DwAAQBAJ|title=The Future Was Here: The Commodore Amiga|last=Maher|first=Jimmy|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|date=2018|access-date=November 19, 2021|doi=10.7551/mitpress/9022.001.0001|isbn=9780262535694}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Amiga 500}}\n* [https://www.retro32.com/buyers-guide/21012020126-commodore-amiga-500-buyers-guide Amiga 500 Buyers guide]\n\n{{Amiga hardware}}\n{{Commodore International}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Amiga]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:68000-based home computers]]","_bytes":41414,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2023-11-20T00:46:35Z"},"title":"Amiga 500","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}

The A1000's case was designed by [[Howard Stolz]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/classes/ism101/Winter05/abstracts/week1.html | title=ISM 101 Seminar: 13 January 2005 | work=USCS Engineering | access-date=2009-03-14 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617144450/http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/classes/ism101/Winter05/abstracts/week1.html | archive-date=June 17, 2010 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>  As Senior Industrial Designer at Commodore, Stolz was the mechanical lead and primary interface with [[Sanyo]] in Japan, the contract manufacturer for the A1000 casing.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/howardstolz | title=Howard Stolz profile | work=Howard Stolz LinkedIn profile | access-date=2009-06-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Amiga 1000 was manufactured in two variations:  One uses the [[NTSC]] television standard and the other uses the [[PAL]] television standard. The NTSC variant was the initial model manufactured and sold in [[North America]]. The later PAL model was manufactured in Germany and sold in countries using the PAL television standard. The first NTSC systems lack the [[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB video mode]] which is present in all later Amiga models.\n\nBecause [[AmigaOS]] was rather [[Software bug|buggy]] at the time of the A1000's release, the OS was not placed in ROM then. Instead, the A1000 includes a [[daughterboard]] with 256&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of RAM, dubbed the \"writable control store\" (WCS), into which the core of the operating system is loaded from floppy disk (this portion of the operating system is known as the \"[[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]]\"). The WCS is write-protected after loading, and system resets do not require a reload of the WCS. In Europe, the WCS was often referred to as WOM (Write Once Memory), a play on the more conventional term \"ROM\" ([[read-only memory]]).\n\n== Technical information ==\nThe preproduction Amiga (which was codenamed \"Velvet\") released to developers in early 1985 contained {{nowrap|128 KB}} of RAM with an option to expand it to {{nowrap|256 KB.}} Commodore later increased the system memory to {{nowrap|256 KB}} due to objections by the Amiga development team. The names of the custom chips were different; Denise and Paula were called Daphne and Portia respectively. The casing of the preproduction Amiga was almost identical to the production version: the main difference being an embossed Commodore logo in the top left corner. It did not have the developer signatures.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Amiga 1000 Developer \"Velvet\" - computer collection vienna ENG|url = http://scacom.bplaced.net/Collection/velvet/velveten.php|website = scacom.bplaced.net|access-date = 2015-08-23|first = Stefan|last = Egger}}</ref>\n\nThe Amiga 1000 has a [[Motorola 68000]] CPU running at 7.15909&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] on [[NTSC]] systems<ref name=Byte/>{{Rp|87}} or 7.09379&nbsp;MHz on [[PAL]] systems, precisely double the video color [[carrier frequency]] for NTSC or 1.6 times the color carrier frequency for PAL. The system clock timings are derived from the video frequency, which simplifies [[glue logic]] and allows the Amiga&nbsp;1000 to make do with a single [[crystal oscillator|crystal]]. In keeping with its video game heritage, the chipset was designed to synchronize CPU memory access and chipset [[direct memory access|DMA]] so the hardware runs in real time without wait-state delays.\n\nThough most units were sold with an analog [[RGB color model|RGB]] monitor, the A1000 also has a built-in [[composite video]] output which allows the computer to be connected directly to some monitors other than their standard RGB monitor. The A1000 also has a \"TV MOD\" output, into which an RF Modulator can be plugged, allowing connection to older televisions that did not have a composite video input.\n\nThe original 68000 CPU can be directly replaced with a [[Motorola 68010]], which can execute instructions slightly faster than the 68000 but also introduces a small degree of software incompatibility. Third-party CPU upgrades, which mostly fit in the CPU socket, use faster [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[Motorola 68030|68030]] microprocessors and integrated memory, as well as provide support for a [[Motorola 68881|68881]] or [[Motorola 68881#68882|68882]] [[Floating-point unit|FPU]]. Such upgrades often have the option to revert to 68000 mode for full compatibility. Some boards have a socket to seat the original 68000, whereas the 68030 cards typically come with an on-board 68000.\n\nThe original Amiga&nbsp;1000 is the only model to have 256&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Amiga Chip RAM]], which can be expanded to 512&nbsp;KB with the addition of a [[daughterboard]] under a cover in the center front of the machine.<ref name=\"a1000_intro\">{{Cite book| url=http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/Amiga_1000_Introduction.pdf | title=Introduction to the Amiga | publisher=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. | year=1986 | access-date=August 26, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613032259/http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/Amiga_1000_Introduction.pdf | archive-date=June 13, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> RAM may also be upgraded via official and third-party upgrades, with a practical upper limit of about 9&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] of \"fast RAM\" due to the 68000's 24-bit [[address bus]]. This memory is accessible only by the CPU permitting faster code execution as DMA cycles are not shared with the chipset.\n\nThe Amiga 1000 features an 86-pin expansion port (electrically identical to the later [[Amiga 500]] expansion port, though the A500's connector is inverted). This port is used by third-party expansions such as memory upgrades and [[SCSI]] adapters. These resources are handled by the Amiga [[Autoconfig]] standard. Other expansion options are available including a bus expander which provides two [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro-II]] slots.\n\n=== Specifications ===\n[[File:JayMiner Mitch.jpg|thumb|[[Jay Miner]]'s signature from the top cover of a Commodore Amiga&nbsp;1000 computer.

Before the release of the [[Amiga 500]] and [[Amiga 2000]] models in 1987, the A1000 was marketed as simply the ''Amiga'', although the model number was there from the beginning, as the original box indicates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bytecellar.com/2016/04/07/it-was-always-the-amiga-1000/|title=It Was Always The \"Amiga 1000\"|date=April 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the A1000 was marketed as ''The Amiga from Commodore'', with the Commodore logo omitted from the case. The Commodore branding was retained for the international versions.\n\nAdditionally, the Amiga 1000 was sold exclusively in computer stores in the US rather than the various non computer-dedicated department and toy stores through which the [[VIC-20]] and [[Commodore 64]] were retailed. These measures were an effort to avoid Commodore's \"toy-store\" computer image created during the [[Jack Tramiel|Tramiel]] era.<ref>{{cite news | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&res=9A01EFDC1038F93AA1575BC0A962948260&scp=5&sq=amiga&st=nyt | title = Amiga's High-Tech Gamble | access-date = 2008-04-11 | first = Susan | last = Chira | work = New York Times, August 29, 1984 | date=August 29, 1984 |url-access=limited}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | last=Starfire | first=Brian | title=Commodore in tough market with new personal computer | newspaper=The Evening Independent (Dallas Morning News) | date=September 13, 1985| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19850913&id=5-cLAAAAIBAJ&pg=5279,3001216 }}{{dead link|date=September 2021}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the operating system, the machine came bundled with a version of [[AmigaBASIC]] developed by [[Microsoft]] and a [[speech synthesis]] library developed by [[Softvoice, Inc]].\n\n== Aftermarket upgrades ==\nMany A1000 owners remained attached to their machines long after newer models rendered the units technically obsolete, and it attracted numerous aftermarket upgrades. Many CPU upgrades that plugged into the Motorola 68000 socket functioned in the A1000. Additionally, a line of products called the ''Rejuvenator'' series allowed the use of newer chipsets in the A1000, and an [[Australia]]n-designed replacement A1000 motherboard called ''The Phoenix'' utilized the same chipset as the A3000 and added an A2000-compatible video slot and on-board [[SCSI]] controller.\n\n== Reception and impact ==\nIn its product preview, ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine was impressed by the computer's multitasking capabilities and the quality of its graphics and sound systems. It also praised its text-to-speech library for voice output, and predicted that the Amiga would be successful enough to influence the personal computer industry.<ref name=Byte/>{{Rp|100}}\n\nThe Amiga 1000 was released to positive reviews. ''[[Compute!]]'' lauded it as an inexpensive, truly general-purpose computer that might break preconceptions dividing the microcomputer marketplace. In this case, it was capable of outperforming most business, as well as arcade game machines and delivering sampled sound, making it suitable for offices, gamers, and digital artists.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/1985-09-compute-magazine/page/n17|title=The Amiga: An In-Depth Review|last=Halfhill|first=Tom R.|magazine=[[Compute!]]|date=September 1985|access-date=December 16, 2022|issue=64|pages=16–28}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised the machine's versatility without any obvious hardware shortcomings and stressed that it was ideal for game designers demanding fewer system constraints.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Computer_Gaming_World_Issue_5.4/page/n23|title=Amiga: The Dream Machine|last=Freeman|first=Jon|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=September–October 1985|access-date=December 16, 2022|volume=5|issue=4|pages=24–25, 34}}</ref> ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)|Creative Computing]]'' magazine had only minor criticisms for what they otherwise called a \"dream machine.\" These criticisms were directed toward its case quality, the disk drives slowing during certain operations, and not finding an <code>[[AUTOEXEC]]</code> command in AmigaDOS, though the marketing vice president of Commodore, Clive Smith, assured the magazine that later production units would address most of its complaints.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing-1985-09/page/n33|title=Amiga – The Message is the Medium|last=Anderson|first=John J.|author-link=John J.
