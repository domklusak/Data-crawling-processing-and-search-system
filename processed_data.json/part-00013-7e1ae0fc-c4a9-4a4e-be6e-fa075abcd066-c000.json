It remains in service with the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] and various export customers.\n\nThe KAB-500Kr is analogous to the American [[GBU-15]] weapon. It uses a standard Soviet/Russian FAB-500 [[general-purpose bomb]], with a nominal weight of {{convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, as a warhead, adding a [[television]] seeker and guidance fins to turn it into a guided, unpowered glide bomb.\n\nThe seeker employs a gimballed daylight television imaging sensor under a wide angle glass dome. Unlike the earlier US [[GBU-8|GBU-8 HOBOS]] and [[AGM-65 Maverick]] which employed contrast lock technology, the -Kr series guidance system employs Scene Matching Area Correlation technology more akin to the US Navy DAMASK seeker or [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk]] DSMAC. This results in the ability to attack low contrast targets by exploiting the contrast of nearby terrain features or objects.\n\nThe bomb is 305&nbsp;cm (10&nbsp;ft) long and weighs {{convert|520|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|380|kg|lb|abbr=on}} is a hardened, armor-piercing warhead capable of penetrating up to 1.5&nbsp;metres (5&nbsp;ft) of reinforced [[concrete]].

However, the economic hardships that hit the nation in the late 1980s hampered this new development program. This prompted Kamov's Designer General to choose a modified version of Ka-50 on which to install the reconnaissance and target designation system. The modified \"Black Shark\" required a second crew member to operate the optronics/radar reconnaissance suite. Kamov decided to use side-by-side seating arrangement, due to the verified improvements in co-operation between the crew members. This twin-seat version was designated Ka-52.<ref name=Andrey_Fomin />\n\n[[File:Kamov Ka-52.jpg|thumb|Serial Ka-52 at Torzhok Air Base]]\nIn comparison to the original Ka-50, the Ka-52 has a new radome with a nose-mounted radar system for targeting giving the Ka-52 a rounder nose profile. A day-and-night TV/thermal sighting system is fitted in a spherical turret under the nose (some examples have an additional mast radar for aerial targets and a second sighting system above the cockpit).

It was designed to be small, fast and agile to improve survivability and lethality.<ref name=\"airforce-technology.com\"/>\n\n===Manoeuvering===\nThe hovering [[service ceiling|ceiling]] is 4,000 m and vertical rate of climb 10 m/s at an altitude of 2,500 m. Having a [[coaxial rotor]] with blades of [[polymer]] results in low inertia both relative to vertical and lateral axes, at 50%–75% as compared to a single rotor helicopter with tail rotor. No tail rotor also means it can perform flat turns at all speeds. A maximum vertical load of 3.5 g combined with low inertia makes the Ka-50 highly agile.\n\n===Navigation systems===\nFlight systems include an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), autopilot and [[head-up display]] (HUD). Sensors include [[forward-looking infrared]] (FLIR) and [[terrain-following radar]].<ref name=Ka-50N_kamov.net/><ref name=\"airforce-technology.com\"/>\n\nThe Kamov Ka-50 is also fitted with an electronic radio and sighting-piloting-navigating system allowing flights at day and night in VFR and IFR weather conditions. The novelty of this avionics is based on the system of precise target designation with digital coded communication system, which ensures the exchange of information (precise enemy coordinates) between helicopters flying far apart from each other as well as with ground command posts.<ref name=Ka-50N_kamov.net/> The Ka-52 is also equipped with a \"[[Phazotron]]\" cockpit radio-locator, allowing flights in adverse meteorological conditions and at night. The necessary information acquired by this radio-locator is transferred to the cockpit's multi-functional display screen. For conducting a fight, both pilots are equipped with range-finders built-in their helmets and they can use night vision eyepieces for night flights.<ref name=Ka-52_kamov.net/>\n\n===Protection and survivability===\nFor its own protection, Ka-50 is fitted with a radar warning receiver, [[electronic warfare]] system and chaff and flare dispensers.<ref name=\"airforce-technology.com\"/> Aerodynamic cases at wings' ends each contain two dispensers, which in turn have 32 x 26&nbsp;mm countermeasures each. The whole system works on principle of evaluated response based on infrared or electronic impulse irradiation.<ref name=Ka-52_kamov.net/> Extensive all-round armour in the cockpit protects the pilot against 12.7&nbsp;mm armour-piercing bullets and 23&nbsp;mm projectile fragments. The rotor blades are rated to withstand several hits of ground-based automatic weapons.<ref name=\"airforce-technology.com\"/>\n\nOther survivability features include armour protection for vital aircraft systems, and crash-absorbing landing gear and seats.<ref>{{harvnb|Butowski|2022|pages=59,62,69}}</ref> Also, not having a tail rotor can improve survivability, since the tail boom isn't load-bearing; during testing, a Ka-50 lost its tail, but still managed to return to base without a problem.<ref>{{harvnb|Butowski|2022|page=11}}</ref>\n\nIt is the world's first operational helicopter with a rescue [[ejection system]] allowing the pilot to escape at all altitudes and speeds. The rotor blades detach using explosive bolts prior to ejection to prevent damage to the crew.

On 6 January 2001, the Ka-50 used live weapons against a real enemy for the first time. On 9 January, at the entry into a mountain gorge in the area of a settlement named Komsomolskoye, a single Ka-50 accompanied by an [[Mi-24]] used S-8 unguided rockets to destroy a warehouse full of ammunition belonging to Chechen insurgents. On 6 February, in the forest-covered mountain area to the south of the village of Tsentoroj, a strike group composed of two Ka-50s and the sole Ka-29 discovered and, from a range of 3&nbsp;km, destroyed a fortified camp of insurgents using two \"9K121 Vikhr\" guided missiles. On 14 February, a similar strike group carried out a \"hunting\" mission in the area of Oak-Yurt and Hatun. In difficult conditions, pilots found and destroyed eight targets. These missions tested the type's airframe, as well as its on-board systems and armament. Its successful performance in difficult, mountainous terrain confirmed the usefulness of the many advanced features of the Ka-50's design, and its power and maneuverability.<ref name=Andrey_Fomin >Andrey Fomin. \"Kamov Warriors\".
