Among the Tandy employees who purchased a [[MITS Altair]] [[kit computer]] was [[purchasing agent|buyer]] Don French, who began designing his own computer and showed it to the vice president of manufacturing [[John V. Roach]], Tandy's former [[electronic data processing]] manager.<ref>obituary, ''[https://thenyledger.com/business/john-roach-pioneer-of-the-personal-computer-is-dead-at-83/ John Roach, Pioneer of the Personal Computer, Is Dead at 83]'', The New York Ledger, Business, March 24, 2022</ref><ref>Texas Christian University, \"John V.

When the two men visited [[National Semiconductor]] in California in mid-1976, [[Homebrew Computer Club]] member Steve Leininger's expertise on the [[SC/MP]] microprocessor impressed them. National executives refused to provide Leininger's contact information when French and Roach wanted to hire him as a consultant, but they found Leininger working part-time at [[Byte Shop]]. Leininger was unhappy at National, his wife wanted a better job, and Texas did not have a [[state income tax]]. Hired for his technical and retail experience, Leininger began working with French in June 1976. The company envisioned a kit, but Leininger persuaded the others that because \"too many people can't solder\", a preassembled computer would be better.<ref name=\"swaine19810831\"/>{{r|thomas1977}}{{r|white198708}}{{r|reed1}}\n\nTandy had 11 million customers that might buy a microcomputer, but it would be much more expensive than the {{US$|30}} median price of a Radio Shack product, and a great risk for the very conservative company.<ref name=\"reed1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.trs-80.org/trs80-introduction-part1/ |title=The Introduction of the TRS‑80 (Part 1) |publisher=TRS-80.org |access-date=January 23, 2015 |author=Reed, Matthew}}</ref>{{r|white198708}} Executives feared losing money as [[Sears]] did with [[Cartrivision]],<ref name=\"leininger19770917\">{{cite conference |url=http://www.trs-80.com/trs80-models-model1.htm |title=TRS-80 architect reminisces about design project |access-date=February 28, 2011 |author=Leininger, Steven W. |date=September 1977 |conference=San Diego Computer Society |archive-date=May 31, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531175602/http://www.trs-80.com/trs80-models-model1.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref> and many opposed the project; one executive told French, \"Don't waste my time—we can't sell computers.\" As the popularity of [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]]—at one point comprising more than 20% of Radio Shack's sales—declined, however, the company sought new products. In December 1976 French and Leininger received official approval for the project but were told to emphasize cost savings; for example, leaving out lowercase characters saved US$1.50 in components and reduced the retail price by {{US$|5}}. The original {{US$|199}} retail price required [[manufacturing cost]] of {{US$|80}}; the first design had a [[membrane keyboard]] and no video monitor. Leininger persuaded Roach and French to include a better keyboard, a monitor, [[datacassette]] storage, and other features requiring a higher retail price to provide Tandy's typical profit margin. In February 1977 they showed their prototype, running a simple tax-accounting program, to [[Charles Tandy]], head of Tandy Corporation. The program quickly crashed as the computer's implementation of [[Tiny BASIC]] could not handle the {{US$|150,000}} figure that Tandy typed in as his salary, and the two men added support for [[floating-point math]] to its [[Level I BASIC]] to prevent a recurrence. The project was formally approved on 2 February 1977; Tandy revealed that he had already leaked the computer's existence to the press. When first inspecting the prototype, he remarked that even if it did not sell, the project could be worthy if only for the publicity it might generate.{{r|ahl198411}}<ref name=\"white198708\">{{Cite magazine |last=White |first=Ron |date=August 1987 |title=The Tandy Story: It all started 10 years ago in a converted used-car showroom... |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1987-08/page/n51 |magazine=80 Micro |pages=50–64 |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref>{{r|reed1}}\n\nMITS sold 1,000 Altairs in February 1975 and was selling 10,000 a year.

Roach and Kornfeld suggested 1,000 to 3,000 per year; 3,000 was the quantity the company would have to produce to buy the components in bulk.

It uses a [[Zilog Z80]] processor clocked at 1.78&nbsp;MHz (later models shipped with a Z80A). The initial Level&nbsp;I machines shipped in late 1977-early 1978 have only 4&nbsp;KB of RAM. After the Expansion Interface and Level&nbsp;II BASIC were introduced in mid-1978, RAM configurations of 16&nbsp;KB and up were offered (the first 16&nbsp;KB was in the Model&nbsp;I itself and the remaining RAM in the Expansion Interface).\n\nThe [[operating system|OS]] [[Read-only memory|ROMs]], I/O area, video memory, and OS work space occupy the first 16&nbsp;KB of memory space on the Model&nbsp;I. The remaining 48&nbsp;KB of the 64&nbsp;KB [[memory map]] space is available for program use, subject to the amount of physical RAM installed.

Later models came with the hardware for the lowercase character set to be displayed with descenders.\n\nWith higher-density RAM chips and purpose-built monitors, higher-resolution crisp displays are obtainable; 80×24-character displays are available in the Model&nbsp;II, Model&nbsp;4, and later systems.\n\nThe Model I has no built-in speaker. Square-wave tones can be produced by outputting data to the cassette port and plugging an amplifier into the cassette \"Mic\" line. Most games use this ability for sound effects. An adapter was available to use [[Atari joystick port|Atari joysticks]].{{r|williams198109}}\n\n== Peripherals ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2017}}<!--many paragraphs with no citations-->\n\n=== Cassette tape drive ===\nUser data was originally stored on [[cassette tape]]. Radio Shack's model CTR-41 cassette recorder was included with the US$599 package.<ref name=\"rscat1977\"/>{{rp|3–4}} The software-based{{r|swaine19810831}} cassette tape interface is slow and erratic;{{r|hoganm319810831}} Green described it as \"crummy ... drives users up the wall\", and the first issue of ''80 Micro'' has three articles on how to improve cassette performance.{{r|green198001}} It is sensitive to audio volume,{{r|fylstra197804}} and the computer gives only a crude indication as to whether the correct volume was set, via a blinking character on screen while data is loaded. To find the correct volume at first use, the load is started and the volume is adjusted until the TRS-80 picked up the data. Then it is halted to rewind the tape and restart the load. Users were instructed to save multiple copies of a software program file, especially if audio tape cassettes instead of certified data tape was used. Automatic gain control or indicator circuits can be constructed to improve the loading process (the owner's manual provides complete circuit diagrams for the whole machine, including the peripheral interfaces, with notes on operation).\n\nAn alternative to using tape was data transmissions from the [[BBC]]'s ''Chip Shop'' programme in the UK, which broadcast software for several different microcomputers over the radio. A special program was loaded using the conventional tape interface. Then the radio broadcast was connected to the cassette tape interface. Tandy eventually replaced the CTR-41 unit with the CTR-80 which had built-in AGC circuitry (and no volume control). This helped the situation, but tape operation is still unreliable.\n\nTRS-80 Model I computers with Level I BASIC read and write tapes at 250 baud (about 30 bytes per second); Level II BASIC doubles this to 500 baud (about 60 bytes per second). Some programmers wrote machine-language programs that increase the speed to up to 2,000 bits per second without a loss of reliability on their tape recorders.  With the Model III and improved electronics in the cassette interface, the standard speed increased to 1,500 baud which works reliably on most tape recorders.\n\nFor loading and storing data from tape, the CPU creates the sound by switching the output voltage between three states, creating crude sine wave audio.\n\nThe first version of the Model I also has a hardware problem that complicated loading programs from cassette recorders. Tandy offered a small board which was installed at a service center to correct the issue. The ROMs in later models were modified to correct this.\n\n=== Model I Expansion Interface ===\nOnly the Model I uses an Expansion Interface; all later models have everything integrated in the same housing.\n\nThe TRS-80 does not use the [[S-100 bus]] like other early 8080 and Z80-based computers.{{r|thomas1977}} A proprietary Expansion Interface (E/I) box, which fits under the video monitor and serves as its base, was offered instead. Standard features of the E/I are a floppy disk controller, Centronics [[parallel port]] for a printer, and an added cassette connector. Optionally, an extra 16 or 32 KB of RAM can be installed and a daughterboard with an RS-232 port.<ref name=\"rsc-02\">{{cite book |year=1978 |publisher=Radio Shack |title=1978 Radio Shack Tandy TRS-80 Computer Catalog RSC-02}}</ref> The 40-conductor expansion connector passes through to a card edge connector, which permits the addition of external peripherals such as an outboard hard disk drive, a [[Speech synthesis|voice synthesizer]], or a VOXBOX voice recognition unit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-3, page 10|url=https://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/flipbook/c1979_rsc-03.html?fb3d-page=10|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|access-date=December 1, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2. page 13|url=https://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/flipbook/c1978_rsc-02.html?fb3d-page=13|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|access-date=December 1, 2022}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, printing with the Model I required the Expansion Interface, but later Tandy made an alternative parallel printer interface available.\n\nThe Model I Expansion Interface is the most troublesome part of the TRS-80 Model I system. It went through several revisions. The E/I connects to the CPU/keyboard with a 6-inch ribbon cable which is unshielded against RF interference and its card edge connector tends to oxidize due to its [[base metal]] contacts. This demands periodic cleaning with a pencil eraser in order to avoid spontaneous reboots, which contributes to its \"Trash-80\" sobriquet. Aftermarket connectors plated with gold solved this problem permanently. Software developers also responded by devising a recovery method which became a standard feature of many commercial programs. They accept an \"asterisk parameter\", an asterisk (star) character typed following the program name when the program is run from the TRSDOS Ready prompt. When used following a spontaneous reboot (or an accidental reset, program crash, or exit to TRSDOS without saving data to disk), the program loads without initializing its data area(s), preserving any program data still present from the pre-reboot session. Thus, for example, if a [[VisiCalc]] user suffers a spontaneous reboot, to recover data the user enters {{key press|V|C|SPACE|✶}} at TRSDOS Ready, and Visicalc restores the previous computing session intact.<ref group=\"note\">The user must take care not to do anything that could cause memory to be overwritten; they should recover immediately without running any other programs. Since programs may start automatically via the TRSDOS AUTO command, during a spontaneous reboot they take the precaution of holding down {{key press|ENTER}} to prevent this from happening. It takes TRSDOS some half a dozen seconds to load from a floppy disk; the user has this long to keep an AUTO'd program from loading. This star parameter became a standard for many software applications running on the Models III and 4; for instance LS-DOS's TED and Prosoft's Allwrite.</ref>\n\nThe power button on the E/I is difficult to operate as it is recessed so as to guard against the user accidentally hitting it and turning it off while in use. A pencil eraser or similar object is used to depress the power button and the E/I has no power LED, making it difficult to determine if it is running or not.\n\nThe expansion unit requires a second power supply, identical to the base unit power supply. An interior recess holds both supplies.\n\nThe user is instructed to power on and power off all peripherals in proper order to avoid corrupting data or potentially damaging hardware components. The manuals for the TRS-80 advise turning on the monitor first, then any peripherals attached to the E/I (if multiple disk drives are attached, the last drive on the chain is to be powered on first and work down from there), the E/I, and the computer last. When powering down, the computer is to be turned off first, followed by the monitor, E/I, and peripherals. In addition, users are instructed to remove all disks from the drives during power up or down (or else leave the drive door open to disengage the read/write head from the disk). This is because a transient electrical surge from the drive's read/write head would create a magnetic pulse that could corrupt data. This was a common problem on many early floppy drives.\n\nThe E/I displays a screen full of garbage characters on power up and unless a bootable system disk is present in Drive 0, it hangs there until the user either presses {{key press|RESET}} on the back of the computer, which causes it to attempt to boot the disk again, or {{key press|Break|Reset}} was pressed, which drops the computer into BASIC. Due to the above-mentioned problems with potentially corrupting disks, it is recommended to power up to the garbage screen with the disk drives empty, insert a system disk, and then hit {{key press|RESET}}.\n\n''InfoWorld'' compared the [[cable spaghetti]] connecting the TRS-80 Model I's various components to the snakes in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.{{r|hoganm319810831}} Radio Shack offered a \"TRS-80 System Desk\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 19|url=https://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/flipbook/c1978_rsc-02.html?fb3d-page=19|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|access-date=November 30, 2022}}</ref> that concealed nearly all the cabling. It can accommodate the complete computer system plus up to four floppy drives and the Quick Printer. Since the cable connecting the Expansion Interface carries the system bus, it is short (about 6 inches). The user has no choice but to place the E/I directly behind the computer with the monitor on top. This causes problems for a non-Tandy monitor whose case did not fit the mounting holes. Also, the friction fit of the edge connector on the already short interconnect cable makes it possible to disconnect the system bus from the CPU if either unit is bumped during operation.\n\n=== Floppy disk drives ===\nRadio Shack introduced floppy drives in July 1978, about six months after the Model I went on sale. The Model I [[disk operating system]] [[TRSDOS]] was written by Randy Cook under license from Radio Shack; Randy claimed to have been paid $3000 for it. The first version released to the public was a buggy v2.0.  This was quickly replaced by v2.1.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 15|url=https://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/flipbook/c1978_rsc-02.html?fb3d-page=15|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|access-date=December 2, 2022}}</ref> Floppy disk operation requires buying the Expansion Interface, which included a single-density floppy disk interface (with a formatted capacity of 85K) based on the [[Western Digital FD1771|Western Digital 1771]] single-density floppy disk controller chip. The industry standard [[Shugart Associates]] SA-400 minifloppy disk drive was used.  Four floppy drives can be daisy-chained to the Model I. The last drive in the chain is supposed to have a termination resistor installed but often it is not needed as it is integrated into later cables.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 14|url=https://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/flipbook/c1978_rsc-02.html?fb3d-page=14|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|access-date=December 1, 2022}}</ref>\n\nDemand for Model I drives greatly exceeded supply at first.{{r|green198001}} The drive is unreliable, partly because the interface lacked an external data separator (buffer).{{r|hoganm319810831}} The early versions of TRSDOS were also buggy, and not helped by the Western Digital FD1771 chip which cannot reliably report its status for several instruction cycles after it receives a command. A common method of handling the delay was to issue a command to the 1771, perform several \"NOP\" instructions, then query the 1771 for the result. Early TRSDOS neglects the required yet undocumented wait period, and thus false status often returns to the OS, generating random errors and crashes. Once the 1771 delay was implemented, it was fairly reliable.\n\nIn 1981, [[Steve Ciarcia]] published in ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' the design for a homemade, improved expansion interface with more RAM and a disk controller for the TRS-80.<ref name=\"ciarcia198102\">{{cite magazine |last=Ciarcia |first=Steve |date=February 1982 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-03/1981_03_BYTE_06-03_Programming_Methods#page/n37/mode/2up |title=Build the Disk-80: Memory Expansion and Floppy-Disk Control |magazine=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]] |volume=6 |issue=3| access-date=October 18, 2013 |pages=36}}</ref>\n\nA data separator and a double-density disk controller (based on the WD 1791 chip) were made by [[Percom]] (a Texas peripheral vendor), LNW, Tandy, and others. The Percom Doubler adds the ability to boot and use [[double density]] floppies using a Percom-modified TRSDOS called DoubleDOS. The LNDoubler adds the ability to read and write {{convert|5+1/4|in|adj=on}} diskette drives with up to 720 KB of storage, and also the older {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} diskettes with up to 1,155 KB. Near the end of the Model I's lifespan in 1982, upgrades were offered to replace its original controller with a double-density one.\n\nThe first disk drives offered on the Model I were Shugart SA-400s which supported 35 tracks and was the sole {{Fraction|5|1|4}}-inch drive on the market in 1977–78. By 1979, other manufacturers began offering drives. Models 3/4/4P uses Tandon TM-100 40-track drives. The combination of 40 tracks and double density gives a capacity of 180 kilobytes per single-sided floppy disk. The use of index-sync means that a \"[[flippy disk]]\" requires a second index hole and write-enable notch. One could purchase factory-made \"flippies\". Some software publishers formatted one side for Apple systems and the other for the TRS-80.\n\nThe usual method of connecting floppy drives involves setting the drive letter via jumper blocks on the drive controller board, but Tandy opted for a slightly more user-friendly technique where all four select pins on the drives are jumpered and the ribbon cable is missing the Drive Select line. Thus, the user does not need to worry about moving jumpers around depending on which position on the chain a drive was in.\n\nA standard flat floppy ribbon cable is usable on the Model I, in which case the drives is jumpered to their number on the chain, or even an IBM PC \"twist\" cable, which requires setting each drive number to 1, but only permits two drives on the chain.\n\nAlthough third-party DOSes allow the user to define virtually any floppy format wanted, the \"lowest common denominator\" format for TRS-80s is the baseline single-density, single-sided, 35-40 track format of the Model I.\n\nThird-party vendors like Aerocomp made available double-sided and 80 track {{Fraction|5|1|4}}-inch and later {{Fraction|3|1|2}}-inch floppy drives with up to 720 KB of storage each. These new drives are half-height and therefore require different or modified drive housings.\n\n=== Exatron Stringy Floppy ===\nAn alternative to cassette tape and floppy disk storage from [[Exatron]] sold over 4,000 units by 1981. The device is a continuous loop tape drive, dubbed the [[Exatron Stringy Floppy|stringy floppy]] or ESF. It requires no Expansion Interface, plugging directly into the TRS-80's 40-pin expansion bus, is much less expensive than a floppy drive, can read and write random-access data like a floppy drive unlike a cassette tape, and it transfers data at up to 14,400 [[baud]]. Exatron tape cartridges store over 64 KB of data. The ESF can coexist with the TRS-80 data cassette drive. Exatron also made a complementary RAM expansion board that installed in the TRS-80 keyboard to increase memory to 48 KB without the EI.<ref name=\"lundell19810831X\">{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22stringy+floppy+from+exatron%22&pg=PA47 |title=Stringy Floppy from Exatron |magazine=[[InfoWorld]] |date=August 31, 1981 |volume=3 |number=17 |access-date=February 15, 2015 |author=Lundell, Allan |pages=47–48}}</ref>\n\n=== Hard drive ===\nRadio Shack introduced a 5 MB external hard disk for the TRS-80 Model III/4 in 1983. It is the same hard disk unit offered for the Model II line, but came with OS software for Model III/4. An adapter is required to connect it to the Model I's E/I.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-8, page 52|url=https://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/flipbook/c1983_rsc-08.html?fb3d-page=52|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|access-date=December 1, 2022}}</ref> The unit is about the same size as a modern desktop computer enclosure. Up to four hard disks can be daisy-chained for 20 MB of storage. The [[LDOS (operating system)|LDOS]] operating system by [[Logical Systems]] was bundled, which provides utilities for managing the storage space and flexible backup. The initial retail price for the first (primary) unit ({{US$|2495|1983|round=-2}}). Later, a 15MB hard disk was offered in a white case, which can be daisy-chained for up to 60 MB. Like most hard disks used on 8-bit machines, there is no provision for subdirectories, but the DiskDISK utility is a useful alternative that creates virtual hard disk \".DSK\" files that can be mounted as another disk drive and used like a subdirectory would.  To display the directory/contents of an unmounted DiskDISK virtual disk file, a shareware DDIR \"Virtual Disk Directory Utility\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=McKay |first1=Bryan |title=DDIR read-me |date=Jan 2, 1986 |page=1}}</ref> program was commonly used.\n\n=== Printers ===\nThe \"Quick Printer\" <ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-2, page 16|url=https://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/flipbook/c1978_rsc-02.html?fb3d-page=16|website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|access-date=December 1, 2022}}</ref> is an electrostatic rotary printer that scans the video memory through the bus connector, and prints an image of the screen onto aluminum-coated paper in about one second. However, it is incompatible with both the final, buffered version of the Expansion Interface, and with the \"heartbeat\" interrupt used for the real-time clock under Disk BASIC. This can be overcome by using special cabling, and by doing a \"dummy\" write to the cassette port while triggering the printer.\n\nTwo third-party printers were for {{convert|57|mm|in|abbr=on}} metal-coated paper, selling for approximately DM 600 in Germany, and a [[dot-matrix printer]] built by [[Centronics]] for normal paper, costing at first DM 3000, later sold at approximately DM 1500 in some stores. It has only 7 pins, so letters with descenders such as lowercase \"g\" do not reach under the baseline, but are elevated within the normal line.\n\nRadio Shack offered an extensive line of printers for the TRS-80 family, ranging from basic 9-pin dot matrix units to large wide-carriage line printers for professional use, daisy-wheel printers, inkjet, laser, and color plotters. All have a Centronics-standard interface and after the introduction of the [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer]] in 1980, many also had a connector for the CoCo's serial interface.\n\nFP-215 is a flatbed [[plotter]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/human39/fp-215-plotter|title=GitHub - human39/fp-215-plotter: Radio Shack TRS-80 FP-215 Flatbed Plotter Info|date=August 11, 2019|via=GitHub}}</ref>\n\n== Software ==\n=== BASIC ===\nThree versions of the [[BASIC]] programming language were produced for the Model I. ''[[Level I BASIC]]'' fits in 4 KB of [[read-only memory|ROM]], and ''Level II BASIC'' fits into 12 KB of ROM. Level I is single precision only and had a smaller set of commands. Level II introduced double precision floating point support and has a much wider set of commands. Level II was further enhanced when a disk system was added, allowing for the loading of ''Disk BASIC''.{{r|thomas1977}}\n\nLevel I BASIC is based on [[Li-Chen Wang]]'s free [[Tiny BASIC]] with more functions added by Radio Shack.{{r|leininger19770917}} The accompanying ''User's Manual for Level 1'' by David A. Lien presents lessons on programming with text and cartoons. Lien wrote that it was \"written specifically for people who don't know anything about computers ... I want you to have fun with your computer! I don't want you to be afraid of it, because there is nothing to fear\".<ref name=\"lien1977\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/Level_1_Users_Manual_1977_David_Lien#page/n0/mode/2up |title=User's Manual for Level 1 |last=Lien |first=David A. |date=1978 |page=1}}</ref>{{r|fylstra197804}} Reviewers praised the manual's quality.{{r|thomas1977}}{{r|yeager197908}}{{r|archer198310}} Level I BASIC has only two [[string (computer science)|string]] variables (<code>A$</code> and <code>B$</code>), 26 numeric variables (<code>A</code> – <code>Z</code>), and one array, <code>A()</code>. Code for functions like SIN(), COS() and TAN() is not included in ROM but printed at the end of the book. The only error messages are \"<code>WHAT?</code>\" for syntax errors, \"<code>HOW?</code>\" for arithmetic errors such as [[division by zero]], and \"<code>SORRY</code>\" for [[out of memory]] errors.\n\nLevel I BASIC is not [[tokenized]]; reserved words are stored literally. In order to maximize the code that fits into 4 KB of memory, users can enter abbreviations for reserved words. For example, writing \"<code>P.</code>\" instead of \"<code>PRINT</code>\" saves 3 bytes.\n\nLevel II BASIC, introduced in mid-1978, was licensed from [[Microsoft]] and is required to use the expansion bus and disk drives. Radio Shack always intended for Level I BASIC to be a stopgap until Level II was ready, and the first brochure for the Model I in January 1978 mentioned that Level II BASIC was \"coming soon\". It is an abridged version of the 16K [[Microsoft BASIC|Extended BASIC]], since the Model I has 12 KB of ROM space. According to [[Bill Gates]], \"It was a sort of intermediate between 8K BASIC and Extended BASIC. Some features from Extended BASIC such as descriptive errors and user-defined functions were not included, but there were double precision variables and the PRINT USING statement that we wanted to get in. The entire development of Level II BASIC took about four weeks from start to finish.\" The accompanying manual is more terse and technical than the Level I manual. Original Level I BASIC-equipped machines could be retrofitted to Level II through a ROM replacement performed by Radio Shack for a fee (originally $199). Users with Level I BASIC programs stored on cassette have to convert these to the tokenized Level II BASIC before use. A utility for this was provided with the Level II ROMS.\n\nDisk BASIC allows disk I/O, and in some cases ([[NewDos/80]], MultiDOS, DosPlus, LDOS) adds powerful sorting, searching, full-screen editing, and other features. Level II BASIC reserves some of these keywords and issues a \"<code>?L3 ERROR</code>\", suggesting a behind-the-scenes change of direction intervened between the creation of the Level II ROMs and the introduction of Disk BASIC.\n\nMicrosoft also marketed an enhanced BASIC called [[Microsoft Level III BASIC programming language|Level III BASIC]] written by Bill Gates,<ref>{{cite book |title=Program Instructions for Level III BASIC |date=1979 |publisher=Microsoft Consumer Products |page=1}}</ref> on cassette tape.  The cassette contains a \"Cassette File\" version on one side and a \"disk file\" version on the second side for disk system users (which was to be saved to disk).<ref>{{cite book |title=Program Instructions for Level III BASIC |date=1979 |publisher=Microsoft Consumer Products |page=11}}</ref> Level III BASIC adds most of the functions in the full 16 KB version of BASIC plus many other TRS-80 specific enhancements.  Many of Level III BASIC's features are included in the TRS-80 Model III's Level II BASIC and disk BASIC.\n\nLevel I BASIC was still offered on the Model I in either 4K or 16K configurations after the introduction of Level II BASIC.\n\n=== Other programming languages ===\nRadio Shack published a combined assembler and program editing package called the Series I Assembler Editor.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |title=1982 Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-6 page 11 |url=https://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/flipbook/c1982_rsc-06.html?fb3d-page=11 |website=Radio Shack Catalogs dot com |publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack |access-date=December 1, 2022}}</ref> ''80 Micro'' magazine printed a modification enabling it to run under the Model 4's TRSDOS Version 6.

Numerous alternative DOSes appeared, the most prominent being [[Logical Disk Operating System|LDOS]] because Radio Shack licensed it from Logical Systems and adopted it as its official DOS for its Models I and III hard disk drive products. Other alternative TRS-80 DOSes included [[NewDos/80|NewDOS]] from [[Apparat, Inc.]], and [[DoubleDOS]], [[DOSPlus]], [[MicroDOS]], [[UltraDOS]] (later called Multidos). The DOS for the Model 4 line, TRSDOS Version 6, was produced by and licensed from Logical Systems. It is a derivative of LDOS, enhanced to allow for the new Model 4 hardware such as its all-RAM architecture (no ROM), external 32 KB memory banks, bigger screen and keyboard, and featured new utilities such as a ram disk and a printer spooler.\n\nThe memory map of the Model I and III render them incompatible with the standard [[CP/M]] OS for Z80 business computers, which loads at [[hexadecimal]] address $0000 with TPA ([[Transient Program Area]]) starting at $0100; the TRS-80 ROM resides in this address space. Omikron Systems' Mappers board remaps the ROM to run unmodified CP/M programs on the Model I. A customized version of CP/M is available but loses its portability advantage.{{r|pournelle198007}}<ref>Theresa Welsh, David Welsh ''Priming the Pump: How TRS-80 Enthusiasts Helped Spark the PC Revolution'', The Seeker Books, 2007,{{ISBN|0979346819}},  Chapter 2 '' The DOS Wars''</ref> ''80 Micro'' magazine published a do-it-yourself CP/M modification for the Model III.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Brewer |first1=Bill |magazine=80 Micro |title=CP/M Cheap |date=March 1983 |issue= |pages=112–122 |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1983-03/page/n111/mode/2up |publisher=CW Communications |access-date=July 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Dan Fylstra]], among the first owners, wrote in ''Byte'' in April 1978 that as an \"'appliance' computer ... the TRS-80 brings the personal computer a good deal closer to the average customer\", suitable for home and light business use.

He criticized the quality of Tandy's application and system software and the high cost of peripherals.

The computer's CPU board has three banks of sockets (8 sockets to a bank) which take type 4116 DRAMs, so memory configurations come in 16 KB, 32 KB, or 48 KB RAM memory sizes. Computers with 32 KB or 48 KB RAM can be upgraded with floppy disk drive storage. There is space inside the computer cabinet for two full-height drives. Those offered by Tandy/Radio Shack are single-sided, 40-track, double-density (MFM encoding) for 180K of storage. Third-party suppliers offered double-sided and 80-track drives, though to control them they had to modify the TRSDOS driver code or else furnish an alternative third-party DOS which could (see below). The installation of floppy disk drives also requires the computer's power supply to be upgraded. There is no internal cooling fan in the Model III; it uses passive convection cooling (unless an unusual number of power-hungry expansions were installed internally, such as a hard disk drive, graphics board, speedup kit, RS-232 board, etc.).\n\nTandy claimed that the Model III was compatible with 80% of Model I software.{{r|freiberger19810831}} Many software publishers issued patches to permit their Model I programs to run on the Model III. Marketing director Ed Juge explained that their designers considered changing from the Model I's 64-column by 16-row video screen layout, but that they ultimately decided that maintaining compatibility was most important.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Juge |first1=Ed |magazine=80 Micro|pages=10–11 |title=Inside 80 |url=https://archive.org/details/80-microcomputing-magazine-1980-09/page/n9 |issue=9 |publisher=CW Communications |access-date=May 22, 2019|date=September 1980}}</ref>\n\nThe Model III's memory map and system architecture are mostly the same as the Model I's, but the disk drives and printer port were moved from memory mapped to port I/O, thus Model I software that attempts to manipulate the disk controller directly or output to the printer (in particular Model I DOSes and application packages such as Visicalc and Scripsit) will not work. Under the supplied TRSDOS 1.3 operating system Model I disks can be read in the Model III, but not vice versa.{{r|hogan19810831}} The optional LDOS OS (by Logical Systems Inc.) uses a common disk format for both Model I and Model III versions.\n\nCustomers and developers complained of bugs in the Model III's Microsoft BASIC interpreter and TRSDOS.<ref name=\"freiberger19810831\">{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA49 |title=Bugs in Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III: How Bad Are They? |access-date=February 28, 2011 |author=Freiberger, Paul |date=August 31, 1981 |magazine=[[InfoWorld]] |volume=3 |number=17 |page=49}}</ref> Tandy/Radio Shack (and TRS-80 magazines like ''[[80 Micro]]'') periodically published many software patches to correct these deficiencies and to permit users to customize the software to their preferences.\n\nDifferences in the WD1771 and WD1791 floppy controllers created problems reading Model I disks on a Model III (the double-density upgrade in the Model I included both chips while a Model III had only the WD1791). The WD1771 supports four data markers while the WD1791 only supports two, and some versions of TRSDOS for the Model I also use them. In addition, they are used by copy protection schemes. Software was available to allow Model I disks to be read on a Model III. The WD1791 supports the 500-bit/s bitrate needed for high-density floppy drives, but the controller is not capable of using them without extensive modifications.\n\nTRSDOS for the Model III was developed in-house by Radio Shack rather than being contracted out like the Model I's DOS. None of the code base from Model I DOS was reused and the Model III DOS was rewritten from scratch; this also created some compatibility issues since the Model III DOS's API was not entirely identical to the Model I DOS. This was primarily to avoid legal disputes with Randy Cook over ownership of the code as had occurred with Model I DOS and also because Radio Shack originally planned several features for the Model III such as 80-column text support that were not included. Two early versions, 1.1 and 1.2, were replaced by version 1.3 in 1981 which became the standard Model III OS. TRSDOS 1.3 is not format compatible with 1.1 and 1.2; a utility called XFERSYS is provided which converts older format disks to TRSDOS 1.3 format (this change is permanent and the resultant disks cannot be read with the older DOS versions).\n\nThe Model III's boot screen was cleaned up from the Model I. Instead of displaying garbage on the screen at power up, it displays a \"Diskette?\" prompt if a bootable floppy is not detected. The user can insert a disk and press any key to boot. On powerup or reset holding down the {{key press|Break}} key will boot the computer into ROM-based Level II BASIC. This ability is useful if the disk drive is not functioning and cannot boot a TRSDOS disk (or if a boot disk is not available); it permits an operator familiar with the machine hardware to perform diagnostics using BASIC's PEEK and POKE commands. This works for the Model 4 as well, but not for the 4P.\n\nWhile Model I DOS is fairly flexible in its capabilities, Model III DOS is hard-coded to only support 180K single-sided floppies, a problem fixed by the many third-party DOSes. To that end, when Radio Shack introduced hard disks for the TRS-80 line in 1982, the company licensed LDOS rather than attempting to modify Model III DOS for hard disk support.\n\nLevel II BASIC on the Model III is 16 KB in size and incorporates a few features from Level I Disk BASIC.\n\nTRSDOS 1.3 was given a few more minor updates, the last being in 1984, although the version number was unchanged. This includes at least one update that writes an Easter Egg message \"Joe, you rummy buzzard\" on an unused disk sector, which is reputedly a joke message left by a programmer in a beta version, but accidentally included in the production master.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trs-80.org/trsdos-rummy-buzzard-release/|title=The TRSDOS \"rummy buzzard\" release|website=www.trs-80.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Model III keyboard lacks {{key press|CONTROL}}. Many application programs use {{key press|@}}, while others use {{key press|SHIFT|Up}}. Often {{key press|CLEAR}} is used in combination with number and alpha keys. The Model III keyboard also lacks {{key press|CAPS LOCK}}; to caps-lock the alpha keys the user presses {{key press|SHIFT|0}}. Under LDOS [[typeahead]] is supported.\n\nBecause TRSDOS 1.3 was found wanting by many users, Tandy offered (at added cost) Logical System's LDOS Version 5 as an alternative. As with the Model I, other third-party sources also offered TRSDOS alternatives for the Model III, including NewDOS, Alphabit's MultiDOS, and Micro Systems Software's DOSPlus. These are compatible with TRSDOS 1.3 and run the same application programs, but offer improved command structures, more and better system utilities, and enhancements to the Microsoft BASIC interpreter. After writing the original Model I TRSDOS, Randy Cook began work on his own DOS, titled VTOS, which was superseded by LDOS and also created some frustration for users as it is the only TRS-80 DOS to be copy-protected.\n\nAlthough mostly intended as a disk-based computer, the Model III was available in a base cassette configuration with no disk hardware and only 16 KB of RAM with Level II BASIC. Radio Shack also offered a 4K version with Level I BASIC, identical to Model I Level I BASIC, but with the addition of LPRINT and LLIST commands for printer output. Upgrading to a disk machine necessitates installing at least 32 KB of RAM, the disk controller board, and another power supply for the disk drives. Disk upgrades purchased from Radio Shack included TRSDOS 1.3; users upgrading from third-party vendors had to purchase DOS separately (most opted for LDOS or DOSPlus), though a great many Model III applications programs included a licensed copy of TRSDOS 1.3.\n\nAs with the Model I's E/I, the RS-232C port on the Model III was an extra cost option and not included in the base price of the computer, though the dual disk Model III for $2495 included the serial port.\n\nLike the Model I, the Model III sold well in the educational market. Many school administrators valued the Model III's all-in-one hardware design because it made it more difficult for students to steal components.{{r|white198708}} ''InfoWorld'' approved of the Model III's single-unit design, simplified cable management, and improvements such as lack of keyboard bounce and improved disk reliability. The reviewer, a former Model I owner, stated \"I'm impressed\" and that \"had the Model III been available, it's probable that I wouldn't have sold it\". He concluded, \"If you're looking for a computer that's not too expensive but that performs well, you would be wise to test the Model III—you might end up buying it.\"{{r|hoganm319810831}}\n\nDon French, who had left Radio Shack to found FMG Software after designing the Model I, expressed his disappointment in the new machine while trying to convert CP/M to run on it. \"I've encountered numerous problems with the floppy drive and its interface. Radio Shack will sell a Model III to anyone. They're trying to market it as a business computer when the existing software is woefully inadequate. 48K just isn't enough.

The first prototype was finished in 1946.\n\n==History==\n\nAfter [[World War II]], [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]] continued its pre-war business of building passenger cars in addition to [[commercial vehicle]]s and [[military vehicle]]s. The factory was nationalised in 1946 two years before the [[Communist]] takeover. Although production of pre-war models continued, a new model, the Tatra 600 Tatraplan was designed in 1946-47 by Josef Chalupa, Vladimír Popelář, [[František Kardaus]] and [[Hans Ledwinka]]. The name of the car celebrated the new Communist [[planned economy]] but also referred to aeroplane inspiration ('éroplan' means aeroplane in colloquial Czech).\n\nOriginally the 600 was known as the '''Tatra 107''', continuing from Tatra's previous aerodynamic cars- the 77, 87, and 97- as it was intended as a newer, smaller, and cheaper version to replace the outdated [[Tatra 57]]. Tatra switched to a new numbering system after WWII, with all car model codes began with 600; as a result, the Tatra 107 became the Tatra 600.\n\nAfter two prototypes \"Ambrož\" (December 1946) and \"Josef\" (March 1947), the 600 went into mass production in 1948. In 1951, the state planning department decided that the Tatraplan should henceforth be built at the [[Skoda Auto]] plant in [[Mladá Boleslav]], leaving Tatra to concentrate on truck assembly. This was quite unpopular with the workforce at both plants: as a result Skoda built Tatraplans for one year only before the model was discontinued in 1952.<ref name=\"tatraplan.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tatraplan.co.uk/|title=Tatra T600 Tatraplan|website=Tatra T600 Tatraplan}}</ref>\n\nThe Tatraplan had a [[monocoque]] streamlined [[Ponton (car)|ponton-styled]] 6-seat [[fastback]] [[sedan (car)|saloon]] body with front [[suicide door]]s and a [[Automobile drag coefficients|drag coefficient]] (Cd) of just 0.32.<ref name=\"tatraplan.co.uk\"/><ref>{{citation | first = Karel | last = Rosenkranz | title = Tatra, Autoalbum | date = 2002 | page = 107 | publisher = MS Press | location = Brno | language = cs | isbn = 978-80-900915-9-7 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | first = Martin | last = Janik | title = Tatra | language = cs | publisher = Computer Press | location = Brno | date = 2004 | page = 76 | isbn = 80-7226-573-3 }}</ref> It was powered by an [[air-cooled]] flat-four cylinder, 1,952&nbsp;cc rear-mounted engine. 6,342 were made, 2,100 of them in Mladá Boleslav.

The player characters are survivors of said war. \n\n== Setting ==\n=== Original setting and game history ===\nAdventures in ''Twilight: 2000'' typically involve a military unit stranded in [[Central Europe]] several years into [[World War III]] and emphasize realistic depictions of military and social systems after a nuclear war. The war, as it continues on from 1997, has aspects of the [[broken-backed war theory]], wherein a catastrophic nuclear exchange occurs between two belligerents and is then followed by a continuation of conventional war.\n\nThe game was first published in 1984 during the [[Cold War]] and was intended to be an accurate depiction of a possible future,{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} but events in the world have rendered the premise of the game an [[alternate history]].\n\nIn ''Twilight: 2000''<nowiki/>'s version of 1995, a series of [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet border conflicts]] expands into general war between the Soviet Union and China. The Sino-Soviet war rapidly escalates from [[conventional warfare]] into exchanges of [[Weapon of mass destruction|nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons]]. In 1996 a cabal of [[East Germany|East German]] and [[West Germany|West German]] military officers seek to [[German reunification|reunify]] their country. Unified German forces stage a [[coup d'état]] against the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]]. The US and NATO allies initially attempt to stay out of the war, but are quickly drawn into the European conflict. France withdraws its troops from Germany and then withdraws entirely from NATO, declaring its neutrality in the conflict.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1997, a largely [[Conventional warfare|conventional war]] is fought between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces throughout Europe. There are limited exchanges of [[Tactical nuclear weapon|battlefield nuclear weapons]], and chemical and biological weapons. During [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] of 1997, the Soviet Union launches a surprise [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]] against targets in the United States and Europe. The US and Great Britain launch retaliatory nuclear strikes against the Soviet Union. France, because of its neutrality, largely escapes direct damage.\n\nIn the aftermath of the nuclear exchanges, both blocs struggle to recover from the damage. The war continues, despite increasing shortages of men, equipment, and fuel. In the United States, there is a breach between the civilian government and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. An open rift develops between \"Civgov\" (the civilian government) and \"Milgov\" (the military government), which leads to a [[Low intensity conflict|low-intensity]] [[civil war]].\n\nBy the summer of 2000, the European [[Theater (warfare)|theater of operations]] has been fought to a near stalemate. In one final effort to break the deadlock and end the war, NATO forces plan a summer offensive across Northern [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and into the [[Baltic states|Baltics]], but the offensive grounds to a halt in the face of a Warsaw Pact counterattack. Several divisions and corps on each side are virtually eliminated, [[supply lines]] are lost, high level command breaks down, and armies in the European theater lose [[Unit cohesion|cohesion]] beyond the [[platoon]] unit. Some go \"native\" and integrate with the militias of independent [[City-state|free cities]], others turn into gangs of marauding bandits, and some small groups of surviving soldiers seek to find their way home.\n\n==== Later history ====\nTo create 300 years of background history for their science-fiction RPG ''[[2300 AD]]'', GDW staff members participated in an in-house simulation called \"The Great Game\", with [[Frank Chadwick]] as referee. Starting with the world situation in 2000 following the Twilight War, players controlled one or more countries and guided them through 300 years of development, including the discovery of [[faster-than-light]] space travel, [[Space colonization|colonization]] of other Earthlike planets, and contact with a variety of sentient aliens. The staff member playing [[France]], [[John Harshman]], did exceptionally well, leading to France being the supreme [[superpower]] in 2300.\n\n=== Revised setting ===\nThe Second Edition (published in 1990) and subsequent editions featured a reworked background intended to be an alternate history closer to 1990s real-world history. Version 2.2, GDW's final edition of the game, was published in 1993 and featured a background in which the [[KGB]]'s [[Alpha Group]] obeys the coup leaders in the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 Soviet coup attempt]] and storms the [[White House (Moscow)|Russian White House]], killing [[Boris Yeltsin]] and effectively preserving communist control. This also has the effect of basically future-proofing the game, as anything that happened in reality after that period could be ignored as the event basically wiped out history after that.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, there were three new official modules for ''Twilight: 2000'' released online, including a source book for East Africa/Kenya, a new standalone adventure played during the same time as the \"Going Home\" module and a Korean source book. These three releases were all officially approved by Marc Miller, who is the current owner of the ''Twilight: 2000'' game, and were the first new releases for the 1st and 2nd edition since the mid-1990s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\n== Publication history ==\n=== First and Second Editions ===\nGDW extended the timeline of ''Twilight: 2000'' to create the background history for the science fiction game ''[[2300 AD]]''; by doing so, the rather depressing post-nuclear environment of ''Twilight: 2000'' is mitigated by the outcome in which the Earth rebuilds itself and begins to [[Space colonization|colonize space]].\n\nFar Future Enterprises has reprinted the first edition of ''Twilight: 2000'' in hardcopy (paper) format, and both the first edition and version 2.2 are available in CD-ROM format. Versions 2.0 and 2.2, both using the system that became standard for GDW's games, are currently available in watermarked PDF format online (as are the first edition rules).\n\n''Twilight: 2000'''s success as a game can be attributed in part to its manner of presenting a military background and setting, without hemming the players into a military's [[Command hierarchy|command structure]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The civilian governments of most countries in the game have been shattered (France and Belgium quit NATO and thus largely escaped war damage) with the US government splitting into the civilian and military governments, as has the military chain of command, supply lines, etc. The various military forces are presented as being much weaker than their stated sizes, occupying civilian territories and relying on civilians for food and small-scale manufacturing, and recruiting from civilian populations to some extent. This all means that the players can feel they are part of a military of some sort, without their characters being forced to submit to higher military authority. Players generally can choose whether they want their characters to try to continue the war, get back home (wherever that may be), join one of the new power groups wherever they are, simply survive as [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] or marauders, or some combination.\n\nIn 1990, realizing that the game's background was in danger of becoming obsolete, GDW published ''Merc 2000'', an alternative campaign setting which revolves around mercenaries fighting brushfire wars in a time in which the Twilight War never occurred. After ''Merc 2000'' was released, many supplements and articles printed in GDW's ''Challenge Magazine'' featured ''Twilight: 2000'' with equipment and background conversions to ''Merc 2000'' or were ''Merc 2000''-only.\n\nIn 1991, GDW licensees [[Paragon Software Corporation|Paragon]] developed the ''[[Twilight 2000 (video game)|Twilight 2000]]'' computer game adaptation (complete with expansion, \"the Colonel\") depicting a squad of 20 soldiers stranded behind enemy lines in Poland, struggling against the despot Baron Czarny.\n\n====Supplements====\nGDW produced over 40 supplements for ''Twilight: 2000'',<ref>{{cite book |title=Players' Guide to the Twilight: 2000 role-playing game system. |date=2006 |publisher=Far Future Enterprises |edition=1 |url=https://www.farfuture.net/Guide%20to%20Twilight%20v1.pdf |access-date=30 January 2021}}</ref> including:\n* ''[[The Free City of Krakow]]'', 1985\n* ''[[RDF Sourcebook]]'', 1986\n* ''[[Howling Wilderness (Twilight: 2000)|Howling Wilderness]]'', 1988\n* ''[[Survivors' Guide to the United Kingdom]]'', 1990\n* ''[[White Eagle (Twilight: 2000)| White Eagle]]'', 1990\n\n=== Third Edition (''Twilight: 2013'') ===\nIn 2006, 93 Games Studio announced that they had acquired the license to produce the official ''Twilight 2000'' Version 3.0, and planned for a 2008 release with the title ''[[Twilight: 2013]]''. According to the developers, the timeline leading to the Twilight War was completely re-written, and no longer focused on a Cold War confrontation between NATO, the Soviet Union and China.\n\nThe ''Twilight: 2013'' core rules were released on 8 November 2008 as a PDF.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=58794| title = Drive-Thru RPG product page}}</ref> A print edition was also released.

It also supplies some basic [[Adventure (role-playing games)|adventures]] to play. GDW additionally published a number of separate adventures for use with ''Merc: 2000''. ''Merc: 2000'' has a supplemental rulebook called ''Special Forces'' which gives guidance for those wishing to play as members of a Special Forces unit. Additional equipment is described and there are more sample adventures.\n\nIn GDW's own gaming magazine ''[[Challenge (game magazine)|Challenge]]'', they close the gaps between the setting of ''Merc: 2000'' and their future role-playing game ''[[Dark Conspiracy]]''. ''Merc: 2000'' characters are confronted there with aliens as the world turns into the near-future setting of Dark Conspiracy.\n\n=== Cadillacs and Dinosaurs ===\n''[[Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (role-playing game)|Cadillacs and Dinosaurs]]'' used the second edition ''Twilight: 2000'' rules and was set in [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Mark Schultz]]'s underground comic book series ''[[Xenozoic Tales]]''. ({{ISBN|1-55878-073-4}})\n\n=== Dark Conspiracy ===\n''[[Dark Conspiracy]]'' used the same set of rules to present a setting in which characters in a near future dystopia fought monsters which hunted human beings.\n\n=== OPFOR Games ===\nCharacters in ''Twilight 2000'' games are typically representative of US and NATO military forces. Within the T2K gaming community, games that are centered on a group of Soviet/Warsaw Pact characters are referred to as \"OPFOR games\" for [[opposing force]]. There are no full OPFOR games as published adventures, but the concept is a popular [[Play-by-mail game|PBEM]] scenario.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n==Awards==\nAt [[1984 Origins Award winners|Origins 1985]], ''Twilight 2000'' was awarded the H.G.

All three models maintain a high level of software and hardware compatibility, with few programs written for an older model being unable to run on the newer ones.

The 1978 prototype \"Green Thumb\" terminal used the MC6847 and the [[Motorola 6809]] microprocessor. However, the prototype contained too many chips to be commercially viable. Motorola responded by integrating the functions of many smaller chips into one chip: the MC6883 Synchronous Address Multiplexer (SAM). The SAM, VDG, and 6809 were used as the core of the AgVision terminal. It was also sold through Radio Shack stores as the VideoTex terminal around 1980.<ref name=\"ElencoAgVision\">{{cite news | url=https://vintagecomputer.ca/agvision-videotex-terminal/ | title=AgVision Videotex terminal | work=Vintage Computer | date=2016-12-22 | access-date=16 April 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe VideoTex terminal provided the foundation for a general-purpose home computer. The internal [[modem]] was removed, and I/O ports for cassette storage, serial I/O, and joysticks were provided. An expansion connector was added to the right side of the case for future enhancements and [[ROM cartridge]]s (\"Program Paks\"). A sticker indicating the amount of installed memory in the machine covers the hole where the modem's LED \"DATA\" indicator had been. On July 31, 1980, Tandy announced the TRS-80 Color Computer, which shares the same case, keyboard, and layout as the AgVision/VideoTex terminals.\n\nTandy viewed businesses as its primary market for computers. Although the company's Ed Juge said in 1981 that the Color Computer was \"our entry into the home-computer market\", he described it as \"for serious professionals\", stating that a word processor and spreadsheet would soon be available.<ref name=\"freibergerfuture19810831\">{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA49 | title=Radio Shack Prepares for the Future | magazine=[[InfoWorld]] | date=1981-08-31 | access-date=26 October 2016 | last=Freiberger |first=Paul | pages=51, 53–54 | volume=3 | issue=17}}</ref> The initial model (catalog number 26-3001) shipped with 4 KB of [[Dynamic Random Access Memory]] (DRAM) and {{nowrap|8 KB [[Microsoft BASIC]]}} in [[Read-only memory|ROM]].

Versions with at least 16K of memory installed shipped with standard [[Microsoft BASIC|Microsoft Color Basic]] or (optionally) [[Extended Color BASIC]]. The only available connection to a display device is to a TV.\n\nEarly versions of the CoCo 1 have a black keyboard surround, the TRS-80 nameplate above the keyboard to the left side, and a RAM badge (\"button\") affixed on the top and right side of the case. Later versions removed the black keyboard surround and RAM button, and moved the TRS-80 nameplate to the mid-line of the case.\n\nThe computer is based on a single [[printed-circuit board]] with all semiconductors manufactured by Motorola including the MC6809E CPU, MC6847 VDG, MC6883 SAM, and RAM, which consists of 2104 (4Kx1) chips (4K models) or 4116 (16Kx1) chips (16K models).{{r|byte198103}} The early CoCos only have eight RAM sockets, so upgrading to 32K requires piggybacking two sets of 4116 chips and adding a few jumper wires. A later motherboard revision removed the 4K RAM option and were upgraded to 32K with \"half-bad\" 4164 DRAMs. These boards have jumpers marked HIGH/LOW to determine which half of the memory chip was good. As memory production yields improved and costs went down, many (perhaps most) 32K CoCo 1s shipped with perfectly good 4164 memory chips.

To cut production costs, the case was shortened by about 25% and a new, smaller power supply and motherboard were designed. The \"melted\" keyboard from the white CoCo 1 and the TDP-100 style ventilation slots were carried over. Aside from the new look and the deletion of the 12 volt power supply to the expansion connector, the computer was compatible with the previous generation. The removal of the 12V power supply crippled some peripherals such as the original floppy disk controller, which then needed to be upgraded, installed in a Multi-Pak interface, or supplied with external power.\n\nThe CoCo 2 was sold in 16K and 64K models. 16K models use 16Kx1 DRAMs, but the chips are not the common 4116; they were instead 4517s (Radio Shack P/N 8040517),<ref>https://www.st-hubert.org/phase2/truepages/elec0006.html {{bare URL inline|date=April 2023}}</ref> which use only +5V power rather than the triple voltages used by the 4116. 64K models use standard 4164 chips and have a control register at $FFDE/$FFDF to switch between the second 32K of RAM and the OS ROMs. With the ROMs banked out, the entire 64K of system RAM can be accessed.\n\nUpgraded BASIC ROMs add minor features and fix some bugs. A redesigned 5-volt disk controller was introduced with its own new Disk BASIC ROM (v1.1). It adds a new command, <code>DOS</code>, to auto-boot software from disk (this requires a disk with a special boot sector). This allows the use of software on copy protected disks or third-party operating systems, chiefly OS-9.\n\nProduction was partially moved to Korea, with production in the US and Korea happening in parallel using the same part numbers.\n\nLater in the production run,{{When|date=July 2020}} the \"melted\" keyboard was replaced with a new, full-travel, typewriter-style keyboard.\n\nThe final significant change in the life of the CoCo 2 (models 26-3134B, 26-3136B, and 26-3127B; 16 KB standard, 16 KB extended, and 64 KB extended respectively) was to use the enhanced VDG, the MC6847T1, allowing lowercase characters and changing the text screen border color. These features were not enabled in BASIC. Midway during the production run of these models, the nameplate was changed from \"Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 2\" to \"Tandy Color Computer 2\". The red, green, and blue shapes were replaced with red, green, and blue parallelograms.\n\n''[[Creative Computing]]'' wrote in December 1984 that the Color Computer was the best educational computer under $1000.

Instead, [[Microware]] provided extensions to Extended Color BASIC to support the new display modes. To not violate the spirit of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and Tandy, Microsoft's unmodified BASIC is loaded in the CoCo 3's ROM. Upon startup, the ROM is copied to RAM and patched by Microware's code. The  patched code has several bugs, and support for many of the new hardware features is incomplete.\n\nMicroware also provided a version of the [[OS-9]] Level 2 operating system shortly after launch. OS-9 uses memory-mapping (so each process has its own memory space up to 64K), windowed display, and a more extensive development environment that includes a copy of [[BASIC09]]. [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] compilers were available. Members of the CoCo OS-9 community enhanced OS-9 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 at Tandy's request, but Tandy stopped production of the CoCo 3 before the upgrade was officially released. Most of the improvements made it into NitrOS-9, a major rewrite of OS-9/6809 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 to take advantage of the features and speed of the [[Hitachi 6309]] (if available).<ref>{{cite web\n  |url = http://www.nitros9.org\n  |title = NitrOS-9 operating system for the Tandy/Radio Shack Color Computer\n  |access-date = 2008-06-11\n}}</ref>\n\nA  joystick adapter designed by Steve Bjork increases the resolution of the joystick/mouse interface by a factor of ten at the expense of CPU time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}\n\n==Hardware==\nInternally the CoCo 1 and CoCo 2 models are functionally identical. The core of the system is virtually identical to the reference design included in the Motorola MC6883 data sheet and consists of five [[Large Scale Integration|LSI]] chips:\n* MC6809E Microprocessor Unit (MPU)\n* MC6883/SN74LS783/SN74LS785 Synchronous Address Multiplexor (SAM)\n* [[Motorola 6847|MC6847]] [[Video Display Generator]] (VDG)\n* Two [[Peripheral Interface Adapter]]s (PIA), either MC6821 or MC6822 chips\n\n===SAM===\nThe SAM is a multifunction device that performs the following functions:\n* Clock generation and synchronization for the 6809E MPU and 6847 VDG\n* Up to 64K Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) control and refresh\n* Device selection based on MPU memory address to determine if the MPU access is to DRAM, ROM, PIA, etc.\n* Duplication of the VDG address counter to \"feed\" the VDG the data it is expecting\n\nThe SAM was designed to replace numerous small LS/TTL chips into one integrated package. Its main purpose is to control the DRAM but, as outlined above, it integrates several other functions as well. It is connected to a crystal at 4 times the television colorburst frequency (14.31818&nbsp;MHz for NTSC countries). This is divided by 4 internally and is fed to the VDG for its own internal timing (3.579545&nbsp;MHz for NTSC). The SAM also divides the master clock by 16 (or 8 in certain cases) for the [[two-phase clock|two phase MPU clock]]; in NTSC this is .89&nbsp;MHz (or 1.8&nbsp;MHz if divided by 8).\n\nSwitching the SAM into 1.8&nbsp;MHz operation gives the CPU the time ordinarily used by the VDG and refresh. As such, the display shows garbage; this mode was seldom used. However, an unusual mode available by the SAM is called the Address Dependent mode, where ROM reads (since they do not use the DRAM) occur at 1.8&nbsp;MHz but regular RAM access occurs at .89&nbsp;MHz. In effect, since the BASIC interpreter runs from ROM, putting the machine in this mode would nearly double the performance of a BASIC program while maintaining video display and DRAM refresh. Of course, this would throw off the software timing loops and I/O operations would be affected. Despite this, however, the \"high speed [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]]\" was used by many CoCo BASIC programs even though it [[overclocking|overclocked]] the hardware in the CoCo, which was only rated for 1&nbsp;MHz operation.\n\nThe SAM has no connection to the MPU data bus. As such, it is programmed in a curious manner; its 16-bit configuration register is spread across 32 memory addresses (FFC0-FFDF). Writing even bytes sets that register bit to 0, while writing odd bytes sets it to 1. The value (D7-D0) that is written is ignored.\n\nDue to limitations in 40-pin packaging, the SAM contains a duplicate of the VDG's internal 12-bit address counter. Normally this counter's settings are set to duplicate the VDG's display mode. However, this is not required and results in the creation of some new display modes not possible when the VDG is used in a system alone. Instead of the VDG requesting data from RAM by itself, the VDG is \"fed\" data by the SAM's internal copy of the VDG address counter. This process is called \"Interleaved Direct Memory Access\" (IDMA) by Motorola and ensures that the processor and VDG always have full access to this shared memory resource with no wait states or contention.\n\nThere are two versions of the SAM. The early one is labeled MC6883 and/or SN74LS783; the later version is labeled SN74LS785. There are some minor timing differences, but the major difference is the support of an 8-bit refresh counter in the 785 version. This allowed for use of inexpensive 16K by 4-bit and certain 64K by 1-bit DRAMs. Some third-party bank-switching memory upgrades that used 256K DRAMs needed this 8-bit refresh counter to work.\n\n===VDG===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2021}}\n[[Image:Coco2boot.png|thumb|320px|CoCo 2 power-on screen]]\n\nThe [[Motorola 6847]] is display generator capable of displaying text and graphics contained within a roughly square display matrix 256 pixels wide by 192 lines high. It can display 9 colors: black, green, yellow, blue, red, white, cyan, magenta, and orange.\n\n====Alphanumeric/Semigraphics display====\n[[Image:Cocobvdg.png|thumb|320px|Sample MC6847 VDG character set display]]\n\nIn alphanumeric mode, each character is a 5 dot wide by 7 dot high character in a box 8 dots wide and 12 lines high. This display mode occupies 512 bytes of memory from $400-$5FF and is a 32 character wide screen with 16 lines. The ROM character generator only holds 64 characters, so no lowercase characters are provided. \"Lowercase\" characters are rendered as uppercase with inverted color. On most CoCo generations it is green on very dark green.\n\n[[Semigraphics]] is a mode where alphanumerics and low resolution graphics can be mixed together. The 8th bit of a character determines if it is alphanumeric or treated as a 2×2 pixel grid. When the 8th bit is set, the next three bits determine the color and last 4 bits specify which quadrants of the character box are either the selected color or black. This allows a 64×32 graphics mode with 9 colors, the only mode where it is possible to display all 9 colors simultaneously.\n\nThere are two colorsets. The default has black characters on a green background. The alternate has black characters on an orange background. The colorset selection does not affect semigraphics characters. The border is always black.\n\nThe 6847 is capable of a Semigraphics 6 display mode, where two bits select a color and 6 bits determine which 1/6 of the character box is lit. Only 4 colors are possible, but the colorset bit of the VDG selects two groups of 4 colors. Only two colors are available in graphics blocks when using Semigraphics 6 on the CoCo.<ref>[http://www.cs.unc.edu/~yakowenk/coco/text/semigraphics.html Semi-graphics-6 display mode] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109215817/http://www.cs.unc.edu/~yakowenk/coco/text/semigraphics.html |date=2019-11-09 }}, By Bill Yakowenko, 25-Mar-1996, Color Computer stuff - Classic Computers, Cs.unc.edu</ref>\n\nThe default alphanumeric display for the CoCo is Semigraphics 4.\n\n====Additional Semigraphics modes====\nBy setting the SAM such that it believes it is displaying a full graphics mode, but leaving the VDG in Alphanumeric/Semigraphics 4 mode, it is possible to subdivide the character box into smaller pieces. This creates the \"virtual\" modes Semigraphics 8, 12, and 24.<ref name=Lomont_CoCoHardware>{{cite web|url=http://www.roust-it.dk/coco/Lomont_CoCoHardware_2.pdf|work=www.lomont.org|title=Chris Lomont's Color Computer 1/2/3 Hardware Programming|access-date=5 May 2020|first=Chris |last=Lomont|date= July 2006}}</ref> In these modes it was possible to mix bits and pieces of different text characters as well as Semigraphics 4 characters. These modes were an interesting curiosity but not widely used, as the Semigraphics 24-screen consumed 6144 bytes of memory. These modes were not implemented on the CoCo 3.\n\nA programmer's reference manual for the CoCo states that due to a fire at Tandy's research lab, the papers relating to the semigraphics modes were shuffled, and so some of the semigraphics modes were never documented. CoCo enthusiasts created experimental programs to try to reverse engineer the modes, and were able to reconstruct the missing documentation.<ref><!--[http://home.att.net/~robert.gault/Coco/History/Semi24.htm Semigraphics24 for the Coco1&2.

Coco ? It Sure Ain't Hot Chocolate</ref>\n\n====Bitmap modes====\nBitmap display modes are divided into two categories: ''resolution'' and ''color''.\n\nIn resolution modes, each pixel is addressable as either on or off. There are two colorsets available: black dots on a green background with a green border, and white dots on a black background with a white border.\n\nIn color modes, each pixel uses two bits to select one of four colors, with the overall colors determined by the colorset: \n* a green border with the colors green, yellow, red, and blue; \n* a white border with the colors white, cyan, magenta, and orange.\n\nResolution graphics store 8 pixels per byte and are available in 128×64, 128×96, 128×192, and 256×192 modes. Color graphics have 4 pixels per byte and are available in 64×64, 128×64, 128×96, and 128×192. The maximum size of a bitmap screen is 6144.\n\n====Artifact colors====\n[[Image:6847 NTSC-färg.png|thumb|320px|Orange artifact color generated with the white and black colorset]]\n\nThe 256×192 two color graphics mode can display four colors due to a quirk in the NTSC television system. These are called [[composite artifact colors]].\n\nIn the first colorset, where green and black dots are available, alternating columns of green and black appear as a muddy green color. With the white and black colorset, the result is either orange or blue. Reversing the order of the alternating dots gives the opposite color. In effect, this mode is 128×192 with four colors: black, orange, blue, and white. On [[PAL]] televisions, instead of solid orange and blue, artifacts appear as vertical stripes of green and peach with soft edges and a width of almost four pixels. On a CoCo 3 with an analog RGB monitor, the black and white dot patterns do not artifact.\n\nThe bit patterns that represent orange and blue can be different each time the system is powered up. Most Color Computer games start with a title screen and ask the user to press the reset button until the colors are correct. This is fixed on the Color Computer 3, and the other colorset can be chosen by holding F1 during reset.\n\n====Lowercase and the 6847T1====\n[[Image:Coco2bvdg lc.png|thumb|320px|6847T1 VDG in true lowercase mode]]\n\nThe 6847 is capable of using an external character generator. Several third-party add-on boards allow the CoCo to display real lowercase characters.\n\nLate in the CoCo 2 production run, the enhanced 6847T1<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |title=MC6847T1 MOS Video Display Generator (Motorola) |url=https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Documents/Datasheets/MC6847T1%20MOS%20Video%20Display%20Generator%20(Motorola).pdf |website=Color Computer Archive}}</ref> VDG was used. It includes a lowercase character generator and the ability to display a green/orange or black border on the text screen.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The lowercase capability is disabled by default on these CoCo 2s, and is not mentioned in the manual.\n\n====Sound====\n\nThe CoCo has two methods of making sound: a 6-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter]] and a separate 1-bit sound source. Cassette playback or an analog signal can be also be routed from the cartridge port to the TV speaker.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\n===PIAs===\nThere are two [[Peripheral Interface Adapter]] chips in all CoCo models. The PIAs are dedicated to I/O operations such as driving the internal 6-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter]], controlling the relay for the cassette motor, reading the keyboard, controlling the VDG mode pins, and accessing the [[RS-232]] serial I/O port.\n\nThe earliest CoCo models have two standard 6821 chips. Later, after changes in the keyboard design, the 6822 IIA (Industrial Interface Adapter) was used instead. The 6822 was eventually discontinued by Motorola, but was produced for Tandy as an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] with the part number SC67331P.\n\n===Interface to external peripherals===\nDue to the CoCo's design, the MPU encounters no wait states in normal operation. This means that precise software controlled timing loops are easily implemented. This is important since the CoCo has no specialized hardware for any I/O. All I/O operations, such as cassette reading and writing, serial I/O, scanning the keyboard, and reading the position of the joysticks, must be done entirely in software. This reduces hardware cost but reduces system performance as the MPU is unavailable during these operations.\n\nAs an example, the CoCo cassette interface is perhaps one of the fastest available (1500&nbsp;bits/s) but it does so entirely under software control. While reading or writing a cassette the CoCo has no CPU time free for other tasks. They must wait until an error occurs or all the data needed is read.\n\n===CoCo 3 hardware changes===\nIn the CoCo 3, a new VLSI ASIC called (officially) the Advanced Color Video Chip (ACVC) or (unofficially) the Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancer (GIME), integrated the functions of the SAM and VDG while enhancing the capabilities of both. The CoCo 3 supports 40- and 80-column text and the ability to run at 1.8&nbsp;MHz without loss of video. The processor was changed to the 68B09E and the PIA was changed to the 68B21, which are 2&nbsp;MHz parts.\n\n==Discontinuation==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2011}}\nOn October 26, 1990, Tandy announced that the CoCo 3 would be dropped from its computer line.\n\n[[Wayne Green]] wrote in ''[[80 Micro]]'' in December 1982 that Tandy had \"virtually abandoned\" the Color Computer. As with its other computers, Tandy attempted to monopolize hardware and software sales, but, he wrote, the Color Computer was incompatible with other Tandy software and what was available was of poor quality. \"I'm sure there are at least fifty software firms out there that would love to work with the Shack\", Green said, but \"it seems that the Shack people are at war with their supporters and potential suppliers\".<ref name=\"green198212\">{{Cite magazine |last=Green |first=Wayne |date=December 1982 |title=Is the Shack in real trouble? |url=https://archive.org/details/80_Micro_1982-12_1001001_US |magazine=[[80 Micro]] |type=editorial |pages=[https://archive.org/details/80_Micro_1982-12_1001001_US/page/n326 8], 10, 12 |access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> Many CoCo owners agree that Tandy did not take the computer seriously.<ref name=\"Tandy Coco Sales\">{{cite book|last1=G.

Some of these systems run OS9/68k, which is similar to [[OS-9]].\n\nFrank Hogg Labs introduced the '''Tomcat TC-9''' in June 1990, which is somewhat compatible with the {{nowrap|CoCo 3,}} but is only able to run [[OS-9]] software. A later version called the '''TC-70''' has strong compatibility with the MM/1, and also runs OS-9/68K.\n\n'''Multi-Media One''' was introduced in July 1990, runs [[OS-9]]/68K on a 15&nbsp;MHz Signetics 68070 processor with {{nowrap|3 MB RAM,}} and a 640×208 graphics resolution as well as supporting a 640×416 interlaced mode. It includes a [[SCSI]] interface, stereo A/D and D/A conversion, an optional [[MIDI]] interface, and an optional board to upgrade the CPU to a [[MC68340|Motorola 68340]]. The '''AT306''' (also known as the '''MM/1B''') is a successor to the MM/1 that contains a Motorola 68306 CPU, OS-9/68K 3.0, and allows [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus cards. It was created by Kevin Pease and Carl Kreider, and sold by Carl's company, Kreider Electronics.\n\nPeripheral Technology produced a 16&nbsp;MHz Motorola 68000 system called a '''PTK68K-4'''. Delmar sold systems based on the PT68K-4 and called the '''Delmar System IV'''. The PT68K-4 has the footprint of an IBM PC and seven 8-bit ISA slots. Video is provided by a standard video card and monitor, but for high-resolution graphics the software only supports certain video cards.\n\nGary Becker produced the '''CoCo3FPGA''' for Terasic DE FPGA boards.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Altera DE1 Board|url=https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=53&No=83|access-date=2021-04-11|website=Terasic Technologies}}</ref> It contains a 6809 CPU core which can run at 25&nbsp;MHz.<ref>{{Cite web|title=System09 VHDL 6809 System on a Chip|url=http://members.optusnet.com.au/jekent/system09/|access-date=2021-04-11|website=members.optusnet.com.au}}</ref> It adds 256-color graphics modes, including a 640x450 mode.\n\nRoger Taylor developed a CoCo 3 clone, '''Matchbox Coco''', based on the DE0-Nano FPGA board.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cococommunity.net/how-to-build-your-own-coco-4/|title = How to Build a Matchbox CoCo – CoCoDaddy}}</ref>  Renamed to '''RealCoCo''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.patreon.com/rogertaylor/|title = RealCoCo}}</ref> it has been ported to other FPGA hardware.\n\n==Clones and cousins==\nThe [[Dragon 32/64|Dragon 32 and 64]] are British cousins of the CoCo based on a reference design from Motorola that was produced as an example of the capabilities of the MC6809E CPU when coupled with the MC6847 Video Display Generator and the MC6883 Synchronous Address Multiplexer. The BIOS  for the Dragon 32 was written based on specifications and API drawn up by Microsoft and, to a certain extent, PA Consulting of Cambridge.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} The Dragon was a much improved unit with video output in addition to the [[television|TV]] output of the CoCo and CoCo 2. It also featured a [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]] (not present on any CoCo), an integrated [[6551]]A serial [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]] (on the Dragon 64), and a higher-quality keyboard. In 1983, a version of the Dragon was licensed for manufacture for the North American market by Tano Corporation of New Orleans, Louisiana. Tano started production at their {{convert|48000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility in September 1983 and were running at capacity one month later. Sales did not meet expectations and Tano stopped production and support after a year.<ref>Dragon Archive History [http://archive.worldofdragon.org/index.php?title=Dragon_History Worldofdragon.org]</ref>\n\nIn Brazil, there were several CoCo clones, including the [[Prológica CP-400|Prológica CP 400 Color]] and CP 400 Color II,'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=1000BiT - Computers list by manufacturer |url=https://www.1000bit.it/database2.asp?id=381 |access-date=2022-12-19 |website=www.1000bit.it}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=ITENS DO FABRICANTE: Prológica |url=https://www.velasco.com.br/index.php?fabricante=%27Prol%C3%B3gica%27 |access-date=2023-01-06 |website=Marcos Velasco - Museu de Tecnologia e Software}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão - SBT |url=https://www.sbt.com.br/variedades/sbt-games/fiquepordentro/227389-documentario-revisita-os-games-para-primeiros-computadores-de-uso-domestico |access-date=2022-12-20 |website=www.sbt.com.br}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=SOARES |first=GUSTAVO |date=2022-12-02 |title=Documentário conta como nasceram os primeiros jogos de computador brasileiros - Juiz de Fora/MG |url=https://www.acessa.com/economia/2022/11/107255-documentario-conta-como-nasceram-os-primeiros-jogos-de-computador-brasileiros.html |access-date=2022-12-20 |website=Acessa.com}}</ref>''' the [[Varix VC 50]],<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news |last=SCHARF |first=Luciano |date=July 2019 |title=Varix VC 50 História e Legado do Mítico TRS-80 Color Nacional |language=Portuguese |pages=60–64 |work=Revista Jogos 80 |issue=21 |url=https://www.jogos80.com.br/edicoes/arquivos/jogos80-21.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-03-03 |title=Micro Varix 50 - TRS Color |url=http://www.cobit.xpg.com.br/micros/varix.htm |access-date=2023-03-21 |website=Clube Old Bits |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233959/http://www.cobit.xpg.com.br/micros/varix.htm |archive-date=2016-03-03 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-07-01 |title=Microcomputador Varix VC50 - Operação |url=https://datassette.org/manuais/br-brasil-hardware-trs-color-tandy-manuais/microcomputador-varix-vc50-operacao |access-date=2023-03-21 |website=Datassette |language=pt-br}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=epocalc - Computer models database |url=http://www.epocalc.net/php/liste_models.php?texte=varix&look=All+fields&yearmax=2025&nocomp=pc |access-date=2023-03-21 |website=www.epocalc.net}}</ref> the [[LZ Color 64]],<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite news |date=August 1983 |title=Equipamentos: Color 64 |pages=46 |work=Micro Sistemas |url=http://www.datacassete.com.br/uploads/revistas/micro_sistemas/micro_sistemas_23.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022111445/http://www.datacassete.com.br/uploads/revistas/micro_sistemas/micro_sistemas_23.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-22 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=brancorp2000 |date=2021-02-17 |title=Review de um LZ Color 64 |url=https://oldplayers.com.br/wp/2021/02/17/review-de-um-lz-color-64/ |access-date=2023-03-20 |website=OLDPLAYERS |language=pt-BR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Campos |first=Daniel |title=Color 64: Uma raridade carioca! {{!}} AMX PROJECT |url=http://amxprojects.com/?p=2037 |access-date=2023-03-20 |language=pt-PT}}</ref> the [[Dynacom MX1600|Dynacom MX-1600]], the [[Codimex CD-6809]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Campos |first=Daniel |title=Codimex CD-6809: A tríade agora está completa! {{!}} AMX PROJECT |url=http://amxprojects.com/?p=2658 |access-date=2023-03-20 |language=pt-PT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=2020-08-03 |title=Codimex CD6809 |url=https://computadoresbrasileiros.wordpress.com/2020/08/03/codimex-cd6809/ |access-date=2023-03-20 |website=Família TRS Color |language=pt-BR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Codimex CD-6809 |url=https://www.velasco.com.br/index.php?item=codimexcd6809 |access-date=2023-03-20 |website=MV - Marcos Velasco Software}}</ref> and the [[vaporware]] Microdigital TKS800.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web |title=Clube do TK90X |url=http://www.tk90x.com.br/Microdigital.html |access-date=2022-12-19 |website=www.tk90x.com.br}}</ref>\n\nIn Mexico, the Micro-SEP, a CoCo 2 clone with 64 KB of memory, was introduced by the Secretary of Education.
