The IEEE 802.15.3 Task Group 3c (TG3c) was formed in March 2005.  This mmWave WPAN is defined to operate in the 57–66&nbsp;GHz range.  Depending on the geographical region, anywhere from 2 to 9&nbsp;GHz of bandwidth is available (for example, 57–64&nbsp;GHz is available as unlicensed band defined by FCC 47 CFR 15.255 in North America). The millimeter-wave WPAN allows very high data rate, short range (10 m) for applications including high-speed internet access, streaming content download (video on demand, HDTV, home theater, etc.), real-time streaming and wireless data bus for cable replacement. A total of three PHY modes were defined in the standard:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.15.3c-2009.pdf |title=IEEE Standard Association - IEEE Get Program |access-date=2015-08-20 |archive-date=2017-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623014701/http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.15.3c-2009.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Single carrier (SC) mode (up to 5.3 Gbit/s)\n* High speed interface (HSI) mode (single carrier, up to 5 Gbit/s)\n* Audio/visual (AV) mode (OFDM, up to 3.8 Gbit/s).\n\n===IEEE 802.15.3d-2017===\nIEEE Std 802.15.3d-2017 defines an alternative physical layer (PHY) at the lower THz frequency range between 252 GHz and 325 GHz for switched point-to-point links is defined in this amendment.

Two PHY modes have been defined that enable data rates up to 100 Gb/s using the 60 GHz band. MIMO and aggregation methods have been defined to increase the maximum achievable communication speeds. Stack acknowledgment has been defined to improve the medium access control (MAC) efficiency when used in a point-to-point (P2P) topology between two devices.\n\n===IEEE 802.15.3f-2017===\nIEEE Std 802.15.3f-2017 extends the RF channelization of the millimeter wave PHYs to allow for use of the spectrum up to 71 GHz.  802.15.3f was initiated because several regulatory domains extended the licensed exempt 60 GHz bands up to 71 GHz. \n\n==IEEE 802.15.4: Low Rate WPAN==\n[[File:IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack.svg|thumb|right |upright=1.2 |Protocol stack for 802.15.4]]\n{{main |IEEE 802.15.4}}\nIEEE 802.15.4-2003 (Low Rate WPAN) deals with low data rate but very long battery life (months or even years) and very low complexity. The standard defines both the physical (Layer 1) and data-link (Layer 2) layers of the [[OSI model]]. The first edition of the 802.15.4 standard was released in May 2003.  Several standardized and proprietary networks (or mesh) layer protocols run over 802.15.4-based networks, including IEEE 802.15.5, [[Zigbee]], [[Thread (network protocol)|Thread]], [[6LoWPAN]], [[WirelessHART]], and [[ISA100.11a]].\n\n===WPAN Low Rate Alternative PHY (4a)===\n{{main |IEEE 802.15.4a}}\nIEEE 802.15.4a (formally called IEEE 802.15.4a-2007) is an amendment to IEEE 802.15.4 specifying additional physical layers (PHYs) to the original standard.  The principal interest was in providing higher precision ranging and localization capability (1 meter accuracy and better), higher aggregate throughput, adding scalability to data rates, longer range, and lower power consumption and cost.   The selected baselines are two optional PHYs consisting of a [[Ultra wideband|UWB]] Pulse Radio (operating in unlicensed UWB spectrum) and a Chirp Spread Spectrum (operating in unlicensed 2.4&nbsp;GHz spectrum).

The IEEE 802.15 task group 4b was chartered to create a project for specific enhancements and clarifications to the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard, such as resolving ambiguities, reducing unnecessary complexity, increasing flexibility in security key usage, considerations for newly available frequency allocations, and others.\n\n===PHY Amendment for China (4c)===\nIEEE 802.15.4c was approved in 2008 and was published in January 2009.  This defines a PHY amendment that adds new RF spectrum specifications to address the Chinese regulatory changes which have opened the 314-316&nbsp;MHz, 430-434&nbsp;MHz, and 779-787&nbsp;MHz bands for Wireless PAN use within China.\n\n===PHY and MAC Amendment for Japan (4d)===\nThe IEEE 802.15 Task Group 4d was chartered to define an amendment to the 802.15.4-2006 standard. The amendment defines a new PHY and such changes to the MAC as are necessary to support a new frequency allocation (950&nbsp;MHz -956&nbsp;MHz) in Japan while coexisting with passive tag systems in the band.\n\n===MAC Amendment for Industrial Applications (4e)===\nThe IEEE 802.15 Task Group 4e is chartered to define a MAC amendment to the existing standard 802.15.4-2006. The intent of this amendment is to enhance and add functionality to the 802.15.4-2006 MAC to a) better support the industrial markets and b) permit compatibility with modifications being proposed within the Chinese WPAN. Specific enhancements were made to add channel hopping and a variable time slot option compatible with ISA100.11a. These changes were approved in 2011.\n\n===PHY and MAC Amendment for Active RFID (4f)===\nThe IEEE 802.15.4f Active RFID System Task Group is chartered to define new wireless Physical (PHY) layer(s) and enhancements to the 802.15.4-2006 standard MAC layer which are required to support new PHY(s) for active [[RFID]] system bi-directional and location determination applications.\n\n===PHY Amendment for Smart Utility Networks (4g)===\nIEEE 802.15.4g Smart Utility Networks (SUN) Task Group is chartered to create a PHY amendment to 802.15.4 to provide a standard that facilitates very large-scale process control applications such as the utility [[smart grid]] network capable of supporting large, geographically diverse networks with minimal infrastructure, with potentially millions of fixed endpoints.

This standard is composed of two parts: low-rate WPAN mesh and high-rate WPAN mesh networks. The low-rate mesh is built on [[IEEE 802.15.4-2006]] MAC, while the high rate mesh utilizes IEEE 802.15.3/3b MAC. The common features of both meshes include network initialization, addressing, and multi-hop unicasting. In addition, the low-rate mesh supports multicasting, reliable broadcasting, portability support, trace route and energy saving function, and the high-rate mesh supports multihop time-guaranteed service.\n\nMesh networking for IEEE 802.15.1 networks is beyond scope of IEEE 802.15.5 and is carried within the [[Bluetooth mesh]] working group.\n\n==IEEE 802.15.6: Body Area Networks==\n{{main |IEEE 802.15.6}}\nIn December 2011, the [[IEEE 802.15.6]] task group approved a draft of a standard for [[Body Area Network]] (BAN) technologies.  The draft was approved on 22 July 2011 by Letter Ballot to start the Sponsor Ballot process.<ref>\n{{cite web |title=IEEE 802.15 WPAN Task Group 6 (TG6) Body Area Networks |url= http://ieee802.org/15/pub/TG6.html |publisher=IEEE Standards Association |date= 9 Jun 2011 |access-date= 9 Dec 2011}}\n</ref>  Task Group 6 was formed in November 2007 to focus on a low-power and short-range wireless standard to be optimized for devices and operation on, in, or around the human body (but not limited to humans) to serve a variety of applications including medical, consumer electronics, and personal entertainment.\n\n== IEEE 802.15.7: Visible Light Communication ==\nThe inaugural meeting for Task Group 7 was held during January 2009, where it was chartered to write standards for [[free-space optical communication]] using visible light.<ref>\n{{cite web |title= IEEE 802.15 WPAN Task Group 7 (TG7) Visible Light Communication |date= April 9, 2011 |publisher= IEEE Standards Association |url= http://www.ieee802.org/15/pub/TG7.html |access-date= 9 Dec 2011}}\n</ref> The 802.15.7-2011 Standard was published in September 2011. In 2015, a new task group was launched to revise the 802.15.7 standard, with several new PHY layers and MAC routines to support optical camera communications (OCC) and light fidelity (LiFi). As the new draft became too large, in March 2017, the 802.15 Working Group decided to continue 802.15.7 with OCC only, which is broadcast only, and to create a new task group 802.15.13 to work on a new standard for LiFi, which obviously needed a significantly revised MAC layer, besides new PHYs. The revision of 802.15.7-2018 was published in April 2019. In September 2020, a new PAR was approved, and a new task group started to work on a first amendment P802.15.7a aiming at increased data rate and longer range for OCC.           \n\n==IEEE P802.15.8: Peer Aware Communications==\nIEEE P802.15.8 received IEEE Standards Board approval on 29 March 2012 to form a Task Group to develop a standard for Peer Aware Communications (PAC) optimized for peer-to-peer and infrastructure-less communications with fully distributed coordination operating in bands below 11&nbsp;GHz. The proposed standard is targeting data rates greater than 100&nbsp;kbit/s with scalable data rates up to 10&nbsp;Mbit/s. Features of the proposed include:\n* discovery for peer information without association\n* discovery of the number of devices in the network\n* group communications with simultaneous membership in multiple groups (typically up to 10)\n* relative positioning\n* multi-hop relay\n* security\n\nThe draft standard is under development, more information can be found on the [http://www.ieee802.org/15/pub/TG8.html IEEE 802.15 Task Group 8 web page].\n\n==IEEE P802.15.9: Key Management Protocol==\nIEEE P802.15.9 received IEEE Standards Board approval on 7 December 2011 to form a Task Group to develop a recommended practice for the transport of Key Management Protocol (KMP) datagrams.  The recommended practice will define a message framework based on Information Elements as a transport method for key management protocol (KMP) datagrams and guidelines for the use of some existing KMPs with IEEE Std 802.15.4.  The recommended practice will not create a new KMP.<ref>{{cite web |title=IEEE 802.15.9 Project Authorization Request (PAR) |url= https://development.standards.ieee.org/get-file/P802.15.9.pdf?t=86937200003 |publisher=IEEE Standards Association |date= 3 Sep 2015 |access-date= 25 Sep 2015}}.</ref>\n\nWhile IEEE Std 802.15.4 has always supported datagram security, it has not provided a mechanism for establishing the keys used by this feature. Lack of key management support in IEEE Std 802.15.4 can result in weak keys, which is a common avenue for attacking the security system. Adding KMP support is critical to a proper security framework. Some of the existing KMPs that it may address are IETF's PANA, HIP, IKEv2, IEEE Std 802.1X, and 4-Way-Handshake.\n\nThe draft recommended practice is under development, more information can be found on the [http://www.ieee802.org/15 IEEE 802.15 web page].\n\n==IEEE P802.15.10: Layer 2 Routing==\nIEEE P802.15.10 received IEEE Standards Board approval on 23 August 2013 to form a Task Group to develop a recommended practice for routing packets in dynamically changing 802.15.4 wireless networks (changes on the order of a minute time frame), with minimal impact to route handling. The goal is to extend the coverage area as the number of nodes\nincrease.<ref>{{cite web |title= IEEE 802.15 .10 Project Authorization Request (PAR) |url=https://development.standards.ieee.org/get-file/P802.15.10.pdf?t=79474900003 |date=23 Aug 2013 |access-date=24 Sep 2015}}</ref>  The route related capabilities that the recommended practice will provide include the following:\n* Route establishment\n* Dynamic route reconfiguration\n* Discovery and addition of new nodes\n* Breaking of established routes\n* Loss and recurrence of routes\n* Real time gathering of link status\n* Allowing for single hop appearance at the networking layer (not breaking standard L3 mechanisms)\n* Support for broadcast\n* Support for multicast\n* Effective frame forwarding\n\nThe draft recommended practice is under development; more information can be found on the [http://www.ieee802.org/15/pub/TG10.htm IEEE 802.15.10 web page].\n\n== IEEE 802.15.13: Multi-Gigabit/s Optical Wireless Communications ==\nThe first meeting of Task Group 13 was held during March 2017, aiming at a new standard on light fidelity (LiFi), i.e. mobile communications by using the light. The aim is to address industrial applications, i.e. ultra-reliable, low-latency connectivity with negligible jitter for next-generation IoT. Compared to 802.15.7, the group decided to rewrite the standard entirely, based on existing and new contributions, to meet those targets. The group first worked on a low-power pulsed modulation PHY (PM-PHY) using On-Off-Keying (OOK) with frequency-domain equalization (FDE) and also a high-bandwidth PHY (HB-PHY) based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) adopted from ITU-T G.9991. The group also decided to implement mobility by considering access points in the infrastructure and mobile users in the service area as inputs and outputs of a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) link. 802.15.13 supports D-MIMO natively with a minimalistic design, suitable for specialty applications. It is implementable on low-cost FPGAs and off-the-shelf computing hardware. The Working Group letter ballot and the IEEE SA Ballot were started in November 2019 and November 2020, respectively. Publication is expected mid of 2022.               \n\n==Wireless Next Generation Standing Committee==\nThe IEEE P802.15 Wireless Next Generation Standing Committee (SCwng) is chartered to facilitate and stimulate presentations and discussions on new wireless related technologies that may be subject for new 802.15 standardization projects or to address the whole 802.15 work group with issues or concerns with techniques or technologies.<ref>\n{{cite web |title= IEEE 802.15 WPAN SCwng Wireless Next Generation Standing Committee |url=http://ieee802.org/15/pub/SCwng.html |date=Nov 2011 |access-date=9 Dec 2011}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|IEEE 802.11}}\n* {{annotated link|IEEE 802.15.4}}\n* {{annotated link|IEEE 802.15.6}}\n* {{annotated link|IEEE 802.11bb}}\n* {{annotated link|Bluetooth}}\n* {{annotated link|DASH7}}\n* {{annotated link|Energy harvesting}}\n* {{annotated link|EnOcean}}\n* {{annotated link|List of device bandwidths}}\n* {{annotated link|Sun SPOT}}\n* {{annotated link|Ultra wideband}} (UWB)\n* {{annotated link|UWB Forum}}\n* {{annotated link|Bluetooth low energy}}\n* {{annotated link|WiMedia Alliance}}\n* {{annotated link|WirelessHD}}\n* {{annotated link|Wireless USB}}\n* {{annotated link|6LoWPAN}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- Don't add non-official sources see [[WP:EL]] -->\n*[http://www.ieee802.org/15/ Official web site]\n*[http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/802.15.html Get IEEE 802 (IEEE 802.15)]\n\n{{IEEE standards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ieee 802.15}}\n[[Category:IEEE 802]]\n[[Category:Wireless networking standards]]\n[[Category:Working groups]]","_bytes":23204,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2023-10-22T21:58:02Z"},"title":"IEEE 802.15","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}

The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the [[Wi-Fi]] brand and are the world's most widely used wireless computer networking standards. IEEE 802.11 is used in most home and office networks to allow laptops, printers, smartphones, and other devices to communicate with each other and access the [[Internet]] without connecting wires. IEEE 802.11 is also a basis for vehicle-based communication networks with [[IEEE 802.11p]].\n\nThe standards are created and maintained by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) LAN/[[Metropolitan area network|MAN]] Standards Committee (IEEE 802). The base version of the standard was released in 1997 and has had subsequent amendments. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote the capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard.\n\nIEEE 802.11 uses various frequencies including, but not limited to, 2.4&nbsp;GHz, 5&nbsp;GHz, 6&nbsp;GHz, and 60&nbsp;GHz frequency bands. Although IEEE 802.11 specifications list channels that might be used, the [[radio frequency]] spectrum availability allowed varies significantly by regulatory domain.\n\nThe protocols are typically used in conjunction with [[IEEE 802.2]], and are designed to interwork seamlessly with [[Ethernet]], and are very often used to carry [[Internet Protocol]] traffic.\n\n==General description==\nThe 802.11 family consists of a series of [[half-duplex]] over-the-air [[modulation]] techniques that use the same basic protocol. The 802.11 protocol family employs [[carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA) whereby equipment listens to a channel for other users (including non 802.11 users) before transmitting each frame (some use the term \"packet\", which may be ambiguous: \"frame\" is more technically correct).\n\n802.11-1997 was the first wireless networking standard in the family, but 802.11b was the first widely accepted one, followed by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. Other standards in the family (c–f, h, j) are service amendments that are used to extend the current scope of the existing standard, which amendments may also include corrections to a previous specification.<ref name=\"IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual\">{{cite web |title=IEEE-SA Standards Board Operations Manual |publisher=IEEE-SA |url=https://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect8.html |access-date=2015-09-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906183258/http://standards.ieee.org/develop/policies/opman/sect8.html |archive-date=2015-09-06 }}</ref>\n\n802.11b and 802.11g use the 2.4-[[hertz|GHz]] [[ISM band]], operating in the United States under [[Part 15 (FCC rules)|Part 15]] of the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] Rules and Regulations. 802.11n can also use that 2.4-GHz band. Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b/g/n equipment may occasionally suffer [[Electromagnetic interference at 2.4 GHz|interference in the 2.4-GHz band]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, and [[Bluetooth]] devices. 802.11b and 802.11g control their interference and susceptibility to interference by using [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS) and [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) signaling methods, respectively.\n\n802.11a uses the [[U-NII|5&nbsp;GHz U-NII band]] which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping, 20-MHz-wide channels. This is an advantage over the 2.4-GHz, ISM-frequency band, which offers only three non-overlapping, 20-MHz-wide channels where other adjacent channels overlap (see: [[list of WLAN channels]]). Better or worse performance with higher or lower frequencies (channels) may be realized, depending on the environment. 802.11n and 802.11ax can use either the 2.4&nbsp;GHz or 5&nbsp;GHz band; 802.11ac uses only the 5&nbsp;GHz band.\n\nThe segment of the [[radio frequency]] spectrum used by 802.11 varies between countries. In the US, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations. Frequencies used by channels one through six of 802.11b and 802.11g fall within the 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[amateur radio]] band. Licensed amateur radio operators may operate 802.11b/g devices under [[Part 97 (FCC rules)|Part 97]] of the FCC Rules and Regulations, allowing increased power output but not commercial content or encryption.<ref name=\"part97\">{{cite web |title=ARRLWeb: Part 97 - Amateur Radio Service |publisher=American Radio Relay League |url=http://www.arrl.org/FandES/field/regulations/news/part97/ |access-date=2010-09-27 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309001406/http://www.arrl.org/FandES/field/regulations/news/part97/ |archive-date=2010-03-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Generations==\n{{Wi-Fi Generations}}\nIn 2018, the [[Wi-Fi Alliance]] began using a consumer-friendly generation numbering scheme for the publicly used 802.11 protocols.

It specified two [[net bit rate]]s of 1 or 2 [[Megabit per second|megabits per second]] (Mbit/s), plus [[forward error correction]] code. It specified three alternative [[physical layer]] technologies: diffuse [[infrared]] operating at 1&nbsp;Mbit/s; [[frequency-hopping]] spread spectrum operating at 1&nbsp;Mbit/s or 2&nbsp;Mbit/s; and [[direct-sequence]] spread spectrum operating at 1&nbsp;Mbit/s or 2&nbsp;Mbit/s. The latter two radio technologies used [[microwave]] transmission over the [[ISM band|Industrial Scientific Medical frequency band]] at 2.4&nbsp;GHz. Some earlier WLAN technologies used lower frequencies, such as the U.S. 900&nbsp;MHz ISM band.\n\nLegacy 802.11 with direct-sequence spread spectrum was rapidly supplanted and popularized by 802.11b.\n\n===802.11a (OFDM waveform)===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11a-1999}}\n\n802.11a, published in 1999, uses the same data link layer protocol and frame format as the original standard, but an [[OFDM]] based air interface (physical layer) was added.\n\nIt operates in the 5&nbsp;GHz band with a maximum net data rate of 54&nbsp;Mbit/s, plus error correction code, which yields realistic net achievable throughput in the mid-20 Mbit/s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/wireless/2003/08/08/wireless_throughput.html |title=Wireless throughput |access-date=2011-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103014005/http://www.oreillynet.com/wireless/2003/08/08/wireless_throughput.html |archive-date=2011-11-03 }}</ref> It has seen widespread worldwide implementation, particularly within the corporate workspace.\n\nSince the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band is heavily used to the point of being crowded, using the relatively unused 5&nbsp;GHz band gives 802.11a a significant advantage. However, this high [[Center frequency|carrier frequency]] also brings a disadvantage: the effective overall range of 802.11a is less than that of 802.11b/g. In theory, 802.11a signals are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path due to their smaller wavelength, and, as a result, cannot penetrate as far as those of 802.11b. In practice, 802.11b typically has a higher range at low speeds (802.11b will reduce speed to 5.5&nbsp;Mbit/s or even 1&nbsp;Mbit/s at low signal strengths). 802.11a also suffers from interference,<ref name=\"ACIisharmfull\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Angelakis  | first1 = V.| last2 = Papadakis | first2 = S.| last3 = Siris | first3 = V.A.| last4 = Traganitis | first4 = A.| title = Adjacent channel interference in 802.11a is harmful: Testbed validation of a simple quantification model| journal = Communications Magazine| volume = 49| issue = 3| pages = 160–166| publisher = IEEE| date = March 2011| issn = 0163-6804| doi = 10.1109/MCOM.2011.5723815| s2cid = 1128416}}</ref> but locally there may be fewer signals to interfere with, resulting in less interference and better throughput.\n\n===802.11b===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11b-1999}}\n\nThe 802.11b standard has a maximum raw data rate of 11&nbsp;Mbit/s (Megabits per second) and uses the same media access method defined in the original standard. 802.11b products appeared on the market in early 2000, since 802.11b is a direct extension of the modulation technique defined in the original standard. The dramatic increase in throughput of 802.11b (compared to the original standard) along with simultaneous substantial price reductions led to the rapid acceptance of 802.11b as the definitive wireless LAN technology.\n\nDevices using 802.11b experience interference from other products operating in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band. Devices operating in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz range include microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors, cordless telephones, and some amateur radio equipment. As unlicensed intentional radiators in this [[ISM band]], they must not interfere with and must tolerate interference from primary or secondary allocations (users) of this band, such as amateur radio.\n\n===802.11g===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11g-2003}}\n\nIn June 2003, a third modulation standard was ratified: 802.11g.

Due to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the application's packet size determines the speed of the data transfer. This means applications that use small packets (e.g., VoIP) create dataflows with high-overhead traffic (i.e., a low [[goodput]]). Other factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and, of course, the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications|first1=Markus|last1=Tauber|first2=Saleem|last2=Bhatti|first3=Yi|last3=Yu|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429|conference=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium|location=Maui, HI, USA|doi=10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211930|access-date=2014-08-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813094612/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429_Towards_energy-awareness_in_managing_wireless_LAN_applications?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2014-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference|title=Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN|first1=Markus|last1=Tauber|first2=Saleem|last2=Bhatti|first3=Yi|last3=Yu|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522|conference=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications|location=Sichuan, China|doi=10.1109/GreenCom.2011.26|access-date=2014-08-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813113706/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522_Application_Level_Energy_and_Performance_Measurements_in_a_Wireless_LAN?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2014-08-13}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached graphs that show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput.

These figures assume there are no packet errors, which, if occurring, will lower the transmission rate further.\n\n==<span id=\"ChannelsAndFreqs\"></span>Channels and frequencies==\n{{See also|List of WLAN channels}}\n\n802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n-2.4 utilize the {{nowrap|2.400–2.500 GHz}} spectrum, one of the [[ISM band]]s. 802.11a, 802.11n, and 802.11ac use the more heavily regulated {{nowrap|4.915–5.825 GHz}} band. These are commonly referred to as the \"2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz bands\" in most sales literature. Each spectrum is sub-divided into ''channels'' with a center frequency and bandwidth, analogous to how radio and TV broadcast bands are sub-divided.\n\nThe 2.4&nbsp;GHz band is divided into 14 channels spaced 5&nbsp;MHz apart, beginning with channel&nbsp;1, which is centered on 2.412&nbsp;GHz. The latter channels have additional restrictions or are unavailable for use in some regulatory domains.\n\n[[File:2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels (802.11b,g WLAN).svg|thumb|center|upright=3.25|Graphical representation of [[Wi-Fi]] channels in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band]]\n\nThe channel numbering of the {{nowrap|5.725–5.875 GHz}} spectrum is less intuitive due to the differences in regulations between countries. These are discussed in greater detail on the [[List of WLAN channels#5GHz|list of WLAN channels]].\n\n===Channel spacing within the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band===\nIn addition to specifying the channel center frequency, 802.11 also specifies (in Clause 17) a [[spectral mask]] defining the permitted power distribution across each channel. The mask requires the signal to be [[Attenuation|attenuated]] a minimum of 20&nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] from its peak amplitude at ±11&nbsp;MHz from the center frequency, the point at which a channel is effectively 22&nbsp;MHz wide.  One consequence is that stations can use only every fourth or fifth channel without overlap.\n\nAvailability of channels is regulated by country, constrained in part by how each country [[Frequency allocation|allocates radio spectrum]] to various services. At one extreme, Japan permits the use of all 14 channels for 802.11b, and {{nowrap|1–13}} for 802.11g/n-2.4.  Other countries such as Spain initially allowed only channels 10 and 11, and France allowed only 10, 11, 12, and 13; however, Europe now allow channels 1 through 13.<ref name=\"CNAF\">{{cite web|title=Cuadro nacional de Atribución de Frecuencias CNAF|publisher=Secretaría de Estado de Telecomunicaciones |url=http://www.mityc.es/Telecomunicaciones/Secciones/Espectro/cnaf |access-date=2008-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213092618/http://www.mityc.es/Telecomunicaciones/Secciones/Espectro/cnaf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-02-13}}</ref><ref name=\"ART\">{{cite web|title=Evolution du régime d'autorisation pour les RLAN|publisher=French Telecommunications Regulation Authority (ART)|url=http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/evol-rlan-250703.pdf|access-date=2008-10-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209172043/http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/evol-rlan-250703.pdf|archive-date=9 December 2006}}</ref> North America and some Central and South American countries allow only {{nowrap|1 through 11.}}\n\n[[File:2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels (802.11g WLAN).svg|thumb|center|upright=3.25|Spectral masks for 802.11g channels {{nowrap|1–14}} in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band]]\n\nSince the spectral mask defines only power output restrictions up to ±11&nbsp;MHz from the center frequency to be attenuated by −50&nbsp;dBr, it is often assumed that the energy of the channel extends no further than these limits. It is more correct to say that the overlapping signal on any channel should be sufficiently attenuated to interfere with a transmitter on any other channel minimally, given the separation between channels. Due to the [[near–far problem]] a transmitter can impact (desensitize) a receiver on a \"non-overlapping\" channel, but only if it is close to the victim receiver (within a meter) or operating above allowed power levels. Conversely, a sufficiently distant transmitter on an overlapping channel can have little to no significant effect.\n\nConfusion often arises over the amount of channel separation required between transmitting devices. 802.11b was based on [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS) modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 22&nbsp;MHz, resulting in ''three'' \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 6, and 11). 802.11g was based on OFDM modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 20&nbsp;MHz. This occasionally leads to the belief that ''four'' \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 5, 9, and 13) exist under 802.11g. However, this is not the case as per 17.4.6.3 Channel Numbering of operating channels of the IEEE Std 802.11 (2012), which states, \"In a multiple cell network topology, overlapping and/or adjacent cells using different channels can operate simultaneously without interference if the distance between the center frequencies is at least 25&nbsp;MHz.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications|url=http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2012.pdf|access-date=2013-12-05|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626000833/http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11-2012.pdf|archive-date=2013-06-26}}</ref>\nand section 18.3.9.3 and Figure 18-13.\n\nThis does not mean that the technical overlap of the channels recommends the non-use of overlapping channels.

Current 802.11 standards specify frame types for use in the transmission of data as well as management and control of wireless links.\n\nFrames are divided into very specific and standardized sections.

The access point uses this bit to facilitate stations in power-saver mode. It indicates that at least one frame is available and addresses all stations connected.\n* Protected Frame: The Protected Frame bit is set to the value of one if the frame body is encrypted by a protection mechanism such as [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP), [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA), or Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2).\n* Order: This bit is set only when the \"strict ordering\" delivery method is employed. Frames and fragments are not always sent in order as it causes a transmission performance penalty.\n\nThe next two bytes are reserved for the Duration ID field, indicating how long the field's transmission will take so other devices know when the channel will be available again. This field can take one of three forms: Duration, Contention-Free Period (CFP), and Association ID (AID).\n\nAn 802.11 frame can have up to four address fields. Each field can carry a [[MAC address]]. Address 1 is the receiver, Address 2 is the transmitter, Address 3 is used for filtering purposes by the receiver.{{Dubious|date=December 2015}}  Address 4 is only present in data frames transmitted between access points in an [[Extended Service Set]] or between intermediate nodes in a [[mesh networking|mesh network]].\n\nThe remaining fields of the header are:\n* The Sequence Control field is a two-byte section used to identify message order and eliminate duplicate frames. The first 4 bits are used for the fragmentation number, and the last 12 bits are the sequence number.\n* An optional two-byte Quality of Service control field, present in QoS Data frames; it was added with [[802.11e]].\n\nThe payload or frame body field is variable in size, from 0 to 2304 bytes plus any overhead from security encapsulation, and contains information from higher layers.\n\nThe Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is the last four bytes in the standard 802.11 frame. Often referred to as the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), it allows for integrity checks of retrieved frames. As frames are about to be sent, the FCS is calculated and appended. When a station receives a frame, it can calculate the FCS of the frame and compare it to the one received. If they match, it is assumed that the frame was not distorted during transmission.<ref name=\"802.11 Technical Section\">{{cite web|url=http://wifi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/wififrame.html|title=802.11 Technical Section|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124151617/http://wifi.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/wififrame.html|archive-date=2009-01-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Management frames===\nManagement frames are [[IEEE 802.11w-2009|not always authenticated]], and allow for the maintenance, or discontinuance, of communication. Some common 802.11 subtypes include:\n* Authentication frame: 802.11 authentication begins with the [[wireless network interface card]] (WNIC) sending an authentication frame to the access point containing its identity.\n** When open system authentication is being used, the WNIC sends only a single authentication frame, and the access point responds with an authentication frame of its own indicating acceptance or rejection.\n** When shared key authentication is being used, the WNIC sends an initial authentication request, and the access point responds with an authentication frame containing challenge text. The WNIC then sends an authentication frame containing the encrypted version of the challenge text to the access point. The access point ensures the text was encrypted with the correct key by decrypting it with its own key. The result of this process determines the WNIC's authentication status.\n* Association request frame: Sent from a station, it enables the access point to allocate resources and synchronize. The frame carries information about the WNIC, including supported data rates and the [[SSID]] of the network the station wishes to associate with. If the request is accepted, the access point reserves memory and establishes an association ID for the WNIC.\n* Association response frame: Sent from an access point to a station containing the acceptance or rejection to an association request. If it is an acceptance, the frame will contain information such as an association ID and supported data rates.\n* [[Beacon frame]]: Sent periodically from an access point to announce its presence and provide the [[SSID]], and other parameters for WNICs within range.\n* {{vanchor|Deauthentication frame}}: Sent from a station wishing to terminate connection from another station.\n* Disassociation frame: Sent from a station wishing to terminate the connection. It is an elegant way to allow the access point to relinquish memory allocation and remove the WNIC from the association table.\n* Probe request frame: Sent from a station when it requires information from another station.\n* Probe response frame: Sent from an access point containing capability information, supported data rates, etc., after receiving a probe request frame.\n* Reassociation request frame: A WNIC sends a reassociation request when it drops from the currently associated access point range and finds another access point with a stronger signal. The new access point coordinates the forwarding of any information that may still be contained in the buffer of the previous access point.\n* Reassociation response frame: Sent from an access point containing the acceptance or rejection to a WNIC reassociation request frame. The frame includes information required for association such as the association ID and supported data rates.\n* Action frame: extending management frame to control a certain action.   Some of the action categories are Block Ack, Radio Measurement, Fast BSS Transition, etc.  These frames are sent by a station when it needs to tell its peer for a certain action to be taken. For example, a station can tell another station to set up a [[block acknowledgement]] by sending an ''ADDBA Request'' action frame. The other station would then respond with an ''ADDBA Response'' action frame.\n\nThe body of a management frame consists of frame-subtype-dependent fixed fields followed by a sequence of [[information element]]s (IEs).\n\nThe common structure of an IE is as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Field\n| Type\n| Length\n| Data\n|-\n! Length\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1–252\n|}\n\n===Control frames===\nControl frames facilitate the exchange of data frames between stations. Some common 802.11 control frames include:\n* Acknowledgement (ACK) frame: After receiving a data frame, the receiving station will send an ACK frame to the sending station if no errors are found. If the sending station does not receive an ACK frame within a predetermined period of time, the sending station will resend the frame.\n* Request to Send (RTS) frame: The [[IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS|RTS and CTS frames]] provide an optional collision reduction scheme for access points with hidden stations. A station sends an RTS frame as the first step in a two-way handshake required before sending data frames.\n* Clear to Send (CTS) frame: A station responds to an RTS frame with a CTS frame. It provides clearance for the requesting station to send a data frame. The CTS provides collision control management by including a time value for which all other stations are to hold off transmission while the requesting station transmits.\n\n===Data frames===\nData frames carry packets from web pages, files, etc. within the body.<ref name=\"Frame Types\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1447501|title=Understanding 802.11 Frame Types|access-date=2008-12-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081125033409/http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1447501|archive-date=2008-11-25}}</ref> The body begins with an [[IEEE 802.2]] header, with the Destination [[Service Access Point]] (DSAP) specifying the protocol, followed by a [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) header if the DSAP is hex AA, with the [[organizationally unique identifier]] (OUI) and protocol ID (PID) fields specifying the protocol.

To select the correct transmission speed or [[Modulation and Coding Scheme]], a rate control algorithm may test different speeds. The actual packet loss rate of Access points varies widely for different link conditions. There are variations in the loss rate experienced on production Access points, between 10% and 80%, with 30% being a common average.<ref>{{cite conference|author1= D Murray |author2=T Koziniec |author3=M Dixon |author4=K.

Numerous time constants are defined in terms of TU (rather than the nearly equal millisecond).\n\nAlso, the term \"Portal\" is used to describe an entity that is similar to an [[IEEE 802.1|802.1H]] bridge. A Portal provides access to the WLAN by non-802.11 LAN STAs.\n\n==Security==\nIn 2001, a group from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] presented a paper describing weaknesses in the [[802.11]] Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) security mechanism defined in the original standard; they were followed by [[Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack|Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir]]'s paper titled \"Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of [[RC4]]\". Not long after, Adam Stubblefield and [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] publicly announced the first verification of the attack. In the attack, they were able to intercept transmissions and gain unauthorized access to wireless networks.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Security Flaws in 802.11 Data Link Protocols |url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/wireless-cacm.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe IEEE set up a dedicated task group to create a replacement security solution, 802.11i (previously, this work was handled as part of a broader 802.11e effort to enhance the [[MAC layer]]). The Wi-Fi Alliance announced an interim specification called [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA) based on a subset of the then-current IEEE 802.11i draft. These started to appear in products in mid-2003. [[IEEE 802.11i]] (also known as WPA2) itself was ratified in June 2004, and uses the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES), instead of [[RC4]], which was used in WEP. The modern recommended encryption for the home/consumer space is WPA2 (AES Pre-Shared Key), and for the enterprise space is WPA2 along with a [[RADIUS]] authentication server (or another type of authentication server) and a strong authentication method such as [[EAP-TLS]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nIn January 2005, the IEEE set up yet another [[IEEE 802.11w-2009|task group \"w\"]] to protect management and broadcast frames, which previously were sent unsecured.

It is maintained by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and was first published in 1988, with updates in 1991, 2000, 2004, and 2019, and an amendment in 2022.<ref name=\"iso8601amd1\" /> The standard provides a well-defined, unambiguous method of representing calendar dates and times in worldwide communications, especially to avoid misinterpreting numeric dates and times when such data is transferred between [[Date and time representation by country|countries with different conventions]] for writing numeric dates and times.\n\nISO&nbsp;8601 applies to these representations and formats: ''dates'', in the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendar (including the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar|proleptic Gregorian]] calendar); ''times'', based on the [[24-hour clock|24-hour timekeeping system]], with optional [[UTC offset]]; ''[[time interval]]s''; and combinations thereof.<ref name=scope>ISO 8601:2004[E] section 1 Scope</ref> The standard does not assign specific meaning to any element of the dates/times represented: the meaning of any element depends on the context of its use. Dates and times represented cannot use words that do not have a specified numerical meaning within the standard (thus excluding [[Chinese calendar correspondence table|names of years]] in the [[Chinese calendar]]), or that do not use [[Character (computing)|computer characters]] (excludes images or sounds).<ref name=scope />\n\nIn representations that adhere to the ISO&nbsp;8601 ''interchange standard'', dates and times are arranged such that the greatest temporal term (typically a year) is placed at the left and each successively lesser term is placed to the right of the previous term. Representations must be written in a combination of [[Arabic numerals]] and the specific computer characters (such as \"{{not a typo|&hyphen;}}\",<!-- U+2010 hyphen per ISO --> \":\", \"T\", \"W\", \"Z\") that are assigned specific meanings within the standard; that is, such commonplace descriptors of dates (or parts of dates) as \"January\", \"Thursday\", or \"New Year's Day\" are not allowed in interchange representations within the standard.\n\n==History==\nThe first edition of the ISO&nbsp;8601 standard was published as ''ISO&nbsp;8601:1988'' in 1988. It unified and replaced a number of older ISO standards on various aspects of date and time notation: [[ISO 2014]], [[ISO 2015]], [[ISO 2711]], [[ISO 3307]], and [[ISO 4031]].<ref name=doc2004>{{citation\n |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n |date=2004-12-01\n |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n |quote=Annex&nbsp;A: ...

The [[lexicographical order]] of the representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years or time offset. This allows dates to be naturally [[sorting|sorted]] by, for example, file systems.\n*Each date and time value has a fixed number of digits that must be padded with [[leading zero]]s.\n*Representations can be done in one of two formats{{spaced ndash}}a ''basic format'' with a minimal number of separators or an ''extended format'' with separators added to enhance human readability.<ref name=isofaqtnd>ISO, FAQ: ''[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 Numeric representation of Dates and Time] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308153102/http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 |date=2013-03-08 }}''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime|title=Date and Time Formats|website=[[w3.org]]|date=|access-date=11 May 2021|archive-date=10 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210510231523/https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime|url-status=live}}</ref> The standard notes that \"The basic format should be avoided in [[plain text]].\"<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 2.3.3 basic format</ref> The separator used between date values (year, month, week, and day) is the [[hyphen]], while the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used as the separator between time values (hours, minutes, and seconds).<!--dead link: [http://lists.ebxml.org/archives/ebxml-core/200104/pdf00005.pdf]--> For example, the 6th day of the 1st month of the year 2009 may be written as {{nowrap|\"2009-01-06\"}} in the extended format or simply as \"20090106\" in the basic format without ambiguity.\n*{{anchor|Reduced precision}} For reduced [[precision and accuracy|precision]],<ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision>Earlier versions of ISO&nbsp;8601 used the word ''accuracy'', not ''precision'', in the relevant section, e.g: 2.3.7 representation with reduced accuracy.

For example, \"2004-05\" is a valid ISO&nbsp;8601 date, which indicates May (the fifth month) 2004. This format will never represent the 5th day of an unspecified month in 2004, nor will it represent a time-span extending from 2004 into 2005.\n*If necessary for a particular application, the standard supports the addition of a [[Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]] to the smallest time value in the representation.\n\n==Dates==\n{{ISOCALENDAR}}\nThe standard uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], which \"serves as an international standard for civil use.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |url=http://astro.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html\n |last=Doggett\n |first=L.

However, ISO calendar dates before the convention are still compatible with the Gregorian calendar all the way back to the official introduction of the Gregorian calendar on 15 October 1582.\n\nEarlier dates, in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], may be used by mutual agreement of the partners exchanging information. The standard states that every date must be consecutive, so usage of the [[Julian calendar]] would be contrary to the standard (because at the switchover date, the dates would not be consecutive).\n\n===Years===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n| YYYY\n|-\n| ±<u>Y</u>YYYY\n|}\nISO&nbsp;8601 prescribes, as a minimum, a four-digit year [YYYY] to avoid the [[year 2000 problem]]. It therefore represents years from 0000 to 9999, year 0000 being equal to 1 [[Anno Domini|BC]] and all others [[AD]], similar to [[astronomical year numbering]]. However, years before 1583 (the first full year following the introduction of the [[Gregorian calendar]]) are not automatically allowed by the standard. Instead, the standard states that \"values in the range [0000] through [1582] shall only be used by mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange\".<ref>{{cite book|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n|date=2004-12-01\n|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n|at=section 4.1.2.1 General\n}}</ref>\n\nTo represent years before [[Year zero|0000]] or after [[Year 10,000 problem|9999]], the standard also permits the expansion of the year representation but only by prior agreement between the sender and the receiver.<ref>{{cite book |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n|date=2004-12-01\n|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n|quote=3.5 Expansion ...

[YYYY] indicates a four-digit year, 0000 through 9999. [MM] indicates a two-digit month of the year, 01 through 12. [DD] indicates a two-digit day of that month, 01 through 31. For example, \"5 April 1981\" may be represented as either {{nowrap|\"1981-04-05\"}}<ref name=isofaqtnd/> in the ''extended format'' or \"19810405\" in the ''basic format''.\n\nThe standard also allows for calendar dates to be written with reduced precision. For example, one may write {{nowrap|\"1981-04\"}} to mean \"1981 April\". One may simply write \"1981\" to refer to that year, \"198\" to refer to the [[decade]] from 1980 to 1989 inclusive, or \"19\" to refer to the [[century]] from 1900 to 1999 inclusive. Although the standard allows both the {{nowrap|\"YYYY-MM-DD\"}} and YYYYMMDD formats for complete calendar date representations, if the day [DD] is omitted then only the {{nowrap|YYYY-MM}} format is allowed. By disallowing dates of the form YYYYMM, the standard avoids confusion with the [[#Truncated representations|truncated representation]]<ref name=\"iso8601amd1\" /><ref name=\"doc2004\" /> YYMMDD (still often used).

[YYYY] indicates the ''ISO week-numbering year'' which is slightly different from the traditional [[Gregorian calendar]] year (see below). [Www] is the ''[[week number]]'' prefixed by the letter ''W'', from W01 through W53. [D] is the ''weekday number'', from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.\n\nThere are several mutually equivalent and compatible descriptions of week 01:\n* the week with the first [[business day]] in the starting year (considering that Saturdays, Sundays and 1 January are non-working days),\n* the week with the starting year's first Thursday in it (the formal ISO definition),\n* the week with 4 January in it,\n* the first week with the majority (four or more) of its days in the starting year, and\n* the week starting with the Monday in the period 29 December - 4 January.\n\nAs a consequence, if 1 January is on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, it is in week 01. If 1 January is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, it is in week 52 or 53 of the previous year (there is no week 00). 28 December is always in the last week of its year.\n\nThe week number can be described by counting the Thursdays: week 12 contains the 12th Thursday of the year.\n\nThe ''ISO week-numbering year'' starts at the first day (Monday) of week 01 and ends at the Sunday before the new ISO year (hence without overlap or gap). It consists of 52 or 53 full weeks. The first ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is ending; if three, they are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Similarly, the last ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is starting; if three, they are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The Thursday of each ISO week is always in the Gregorian calendar year denoted by the ISO week-numbering year.\n\nExamples:\n*{{#time: l j F Y |2008-12-29}} is written \"{{#time: o-\"W\"W-N|2008-12-29}}\"\n*{{#time: l j F Y |2010-01-03}} is written \"{{#time: o-\"W\"W-N|2010-01-03}}\"\n\n===Ordinal dates===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n| YYYY-DDD ||''or''|| YYYYDDD\n|}\n\nAn ''[[ordinal date]]'' is an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] format for the multiples of a day elapsed since the start of year.\nIt is represented as \"YYYY-DDD\" (or YYYYDDD), where [YYYY] indicates a year and [DDD] is the \"day of year\", from 001 through 365 (366 in [[leap year]]s). For example, {{nowrap|\"1981-04-05\"}} is the same as {{nowrap|\"1981-095\"}}.\n\nThis simple form is preferable for occasions when the arbitrary nature of week and month definitions are more of an impediment than an aid, for instance, when comparing dates from different calendars. \nThis format is used with simple hardware systems that have a need for a date system, but where including full calendar calculation software may be a significant nuisance. This system is sometimes referred to as \"Julian Date\", but this can cause confusion with the astronomical [[Julian day]], a sequential count of the number of days since day 0 beginning {{nowrap|1 January 4713 BC}} Greenwich noon, Julian proleptic calendar (or noon on ISO date {{nowrap|−4713-11-24}} which uses the Gregorian proleptic calendar with a year 0000).\n\n==Times==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|Thh:mm:ss.sss\n|''or''\n|Thhmmss.sss\n|-\n| Thh:mm:ss ||''or''|| Thhmmss\n|-\n| Thh:mm.mmm ||''or''|| Thhmm.mmm\n|-\n| Thh:mm ||''or''|| Thhmm\n|-\n| Thh.hhh ||  || \n|-\n| Thh ||  || \n|-\n| colspan=3 | '''In unambiguous contexts*'''\n|-\n|hh:mm:ss.sss\n|''or''\n|hhmmss.sss*\n|-\n| hh:mm:ss ||''or''|| hhmmss*\n|-\n| hh:mm ||''or''|| hhmm*\n|-\n| hh* ||  || \n|- \n| colspan=3 | <small>* Unambiguous here because they are in the ''Times'' section of this Wikipedia article.</small>\n|}\n\nISO&nbsp;8601 uses the [[24-hour clock]] system. As of ISO&nbsp;8601-1:2019, the ''basic format'' is T[hh][mm][ss] and the ''extended format'' is T[hh]:[mm]:[ss]. Earlier versions omitted the T (representing time) in both formats.\n*[hh] refers to a zero-padded [[hour]] between 00 and 24.\n*[mm] refers to a zero-padded [[minute]] between 00 and 59.\n*[ss] refers to a zero-padded [[second]] between 00 and 60 (where 60 is only used to denote an added [[leap second]]).\nSo a time might appear as either \"T134730\" in the ''basic format'' or \"T13:47:30\" in the ''extended format''. ISO&nbsp;8601-1:2019 allows the T to be omitted in the extended format, as in \"13:47:30\", but only allows the T to be omitted in the basic format when there is no risk of confusion with date expressions.\n\nEither the seconds, or the minutes and seconds, may be omitted from the basic or extended time formats for greater brevity but decreased precision; the resulting reduced precision time formats are:<ref>ISO 8601-1:2019 section 5.3.1.3 Representations with reduced precision</ref>\n*T[hh][mm] in ''basic format'' or T[hh]:[mm] in ''extended format'', when seconds are omitted.\n*T[hh], when both seconds and minutes are omitted.\n\nAs of ISO&nbsp;8601-1:2019/Amd 1:2022, \"00:00:00\" may be used to refer to ''[[midnight]]'' corresponding to the instant at the beginning of a calendar day; and \"24:00:00\" to refer to midnight corresponding to the instant at the end of a calendar day.<ref name=iso8601amd1>{{citation\n |title=ISO 8601-1:2019/Amd 1:2022\n |date=2022-10-25\n |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]}}</ref> ISO&nbsp;8601-1:2019 as originally published removed \"24:00:00\" as a representation for the end of day although it had been permitted in earlier versions of the standard.\n\nA decimal fraction may be added to the lowest order time element present in any of these representations. A [[decimal mark]], either a [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] or a [[full stop|dot]], is used as a separator between the time element and its fraction. (Following [[ISO/IEC 80000|ISO 80000-1]] according to ISO&nbsp;8601:1-2019,<ref>ISO 8601-1:2019 section 3.1.3.9 Decimal sign</ref> it does not stipulate a preference except within International Standards, but with a preference for a [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] according to ISO&nbsp;8601:2004.<ref>{{citation\n |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n |date=2004-12-01\n |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n |quote=4.2.2.4 ... the decimal fraction shall be divided from the integer part by the decimal sign specified in ISO 31-0, i.e. the comma [,] or full stop [.].

However, the number of decimal places needs to be agreed to by the communicating parties. For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, the [[Significant figures|precision]] of a decimal fraction is 3 for a DATETIME, i.e., \"yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss[.mmm]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2005/ms190977(v=sql.90) |title=ISO 8601 Format |department=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]] |website=[[Microsoft Docs]] |date=3 December 2008 |access-date=2021-10-20 |archive-date=2021-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211020172442/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2005/ms190977(v=sql.90) |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Time zone designators===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;Z\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;±hh:mm\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;±hhmm\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;±hh\n|}\n\n[[Time zone]]s in ISO&nbsp;8601 are represented as local time (with the location unspecified), as [[UTC]], or as an offset from UTC.\n\n====Local time (unqualified)====\nIf no UTC relation information is given with a time representation, the time is assumed to be in local time. While it ''may'' be safe to assume local time when communicating in the same time zone, it is ambiguous when used in communicating across different time zones. Even within a single geographic time zone, some local times will be ambiguous if the region observes [[daylight saving time]]. It is usually preferable to indicate a time zone (zone designator) using the standard's notation.\n\n====Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)====\nIf the time is in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], add a ''Z'' directly after the time without a space. ''Z'' is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset. \"09:30 UTC\" is therefore represented as \"09:30Z\" or \"T0930Z\". \"14:45:15 UTC\" would be \"14:45:15Z\" or \"T144515Z\".\n\nThe ''Z'' suffix in the ISO&nbsp;8601 time representation is sometimes referred to as \"Zulu time\" or \"Zulu meridian\" because the same letter is used to designate the [[List of military time zones|Zulu time zone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221005210715/https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html|archive-date=2022-10-05|author=Markus Kuhn|date=2020-06-16|title=A summary of the international standard date and time notation|access-date=2022-10-05|url-status=live }}</ref> However the ACP 121 standard that defines the list of military time zones makes no mention of UTC and derives the \"Zulu time\" from the [[Greenwich Mean Time]]<ref name=\"ACP_121_I\">{{cite web |url=https://rnzncomms.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/acp121_i_2010.pdf |title=Communication Instructions General ACP 121(I) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=October 2010 |publisher=[[Combined Communications Electronics Board]] |access-date=2018-01-15 |archive-date=2018-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081251/https://rnzncomms.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/acp121_i_2010.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> which was formerly used as the international civil time standard.

The offset is applied to [[UTC]] to get the [[civil time]] in the designated [[time zone]] in the format '±[hh]:[mm]', '±[hh][mm]', or '±[hh]'.\n\nA negative [[UTC offset]] describes a [[time zone]] west of the [[prime meridian]] where the [[civil time]] is behind [[UTC]]. So the zone designation for [[New York (city)|New York]] (on [[standard time]]) would be \"&minus;05:00\",\"&minus;0500\", or \"&minus;05\".\n\nA positive [[UTC offset]] describes a [[time zone]] east of the [[prime meridian]] where the [[civil time]] is ahead of [[UTC]]. So the zone designation for [[Cairo]] will be \"+02:00\",\"+0200\", or \"+02\".\n\nA [[time zone]] where the [[civil time]] coincides with [[UTC]] is always designated as positive, though the offset is zero. So the zone designation for [[London]] (on [[standard time]]) would be \"[[UTC+00:00|+00:00]]\", \"[[UTC+00:00|+0000]]\", or \"[[UTC+00:00|+00]]\".\n\n=====Additional examples=====\n* \"[[UTC-10:00|&minus;10:00]]\" for [[Honolulu]]\n* \"[[UTC-06:00|&minus;06:00]]\" for [[Chicago]] on [[standard time]], or [[Denver]] on [[daylight savings time]]\n* \"[[UTC+01:00|+01:00]]\" for [[London]] on [[British Summer Time]]\n* \"[[UTC+04:00|+04:00]]\" for [[Dubai]]\n* \"[[UTC+05:30|+05:30]]\" for [[Mumbai]]\nSee [[List of UTC offsets]] for other [[UTC offset]]s.\n\n=====Other Specifications=====\nIt is not permitted to state a zero value time offset with a negative sign, as \"&minus;00:00\", \"&minus;0000\", or \"&minus;00\".

For example, {{nowrap|\"2007-04-05T14:30Z\"}} or {{nowrap|\"2007-04-05T12:30−02:00\"}}.\n\nEither basic or extended formats may be used, but both date and time must use the same format. The date expression may be calendar, week, or ordinal, and must use a complete representation. The time may be represented using a specified reduced precision format.\n\n==Durations==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| PnYnMnDTnHnMnS\n|-\n| PnW\n|-\n| P&lt;date&gt;T&lt;time&gt;\n|}\nDurations define the amount of intervening time in a time interval and are represented by the format P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S or P[n]W as shown on the aside. In these representations, the [n] is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the [n]. Leading zeros are not required, but the maximum number of digits for each element should be agreed to by the communicating parties. The capital letters ''P'', ''Y'', ''M'', ''W'', ''D'', ''T'', ''H'', ''M'', and ''S'' are designators for each of the date and time elements and are not replaced.\n\n*''P'' is the duration designator (for ''period'') placed at the start of the duration representation.\n**''Y'' is the year designator that follows the value for the number of calendar years.\n**''M'' is the month designator that follows the value for the number of calendar months.\n**''W'' is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.\n**''D'' is the day designator that follows the value for the number of calendar days.\n*''T'' is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.\n**''H'' is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.\n**''M'' is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.\n**''S'' is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.\n\nFor example, \"P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S\" represents a duration of \"three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds\".\n\nDate and time elements including their designator may be omitted if their value is zero, and lower-order elements may also be omitted for reduced precision. For example, \"P23DT23H\" and \"P4Y\" are both acceptable duration representations. However, at least one element must be present, thus \"P\" is not a valid representation for a duration of 0 seconds. \"PT0S\" or \"P0D\", however, are both valid and represent the same duration.\n\nTo resolve ambiguity, \"P1M\" is a one-month duration and \"PT1M\" is a one-minute duration (note the time designator, T, that precedes the time value). The smallest value used may also have a decimal fraction,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Data elements and interchange formats — Information interchange - Representation of dates and times — Part 1: Basic rules|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0038_iso_wd_8601-1_2016-02-16.pdf|website=The Library of Congress|page=23|quote=b) If necessary for a particular application, the lowest order components may have a decimal fraction.|access-date=2021-07-06|archive-date=2021-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210312212543/http://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0038_iso_wd_8601-1_2016-02-16.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> as in \"P0.5Y\" to indicate half a year. This decimal fraction may be specified with either a [[comma]] or a [[full stop]], as in \"P0,5Y\" or \"P0.5Y\". The standard does not prohibit date and time values in a duration representation from exceeding their \"carry over points\" except as noted below. Thus, \"PT36H\" could be used as well as \"P1DT12H\" for representing the same duration. But keep in mind that \"PT36H\" is not the same as \"P1DT12H\" when switching from or to [[Daylight saving time]].\n\nAlternatively, a format for duration based on combined date and time representations may be used by agreement between the communicating parties either in the basic format PYYYYMMDDThhmmss or in the extended format {{nowrap|P[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[hh]:[mm]:[ss]}}. For example, the first duration shown above would be {{nowrap|\"P0003-06-04T12:30:05\"}}. However, individual date and time values cannot exceed their [[modular arithmetic|moduli]] (e.g. a value of 13 for the month or 25 for the hour would not be permissible).<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 4.4.3.3 Alternative format, ISO 8601-1:2019 section 5.5.2.4 Alternative format</ref>\n\nThe standard describes a duration as part of time intervals, which are discussed in the next section. The duration format on its own is ambiguous regarding the total number of days in a calendar year and calendar month. The number of seconds in a calendar day is also ambiguous because of [[leap second]]s. For example \"P1M\" on its own could be 28, 29, 30, or 31 days. There is no ambiguity when used in a time interval. Using example \"P2M\" duration of two calendar months:\n\n* interval 2003-02-15T00:00:00Z/P2M ends two calendar months later at 2003-04-15T00:00:00Z which is 59 days later\n* interval 2003-07-15T00:00:00Z/P2M ends two calendar months later at 2003-09-15T00:00:00Z which is 62 days later\nThe duration format (or a subset thereof) is widely used independent of time intervals, as with the Java 8 Duration class which supports a subset of the duration format.<ref>{{cite web |title=Java 8 Class Duration |url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence- |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014075752/https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence- |archive-date=2017-10-14 |access-date=2017-10-07 |website=Java Platform Standard Edition 8 |publisher=Oracle}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Amazon Alexa Duration |url=https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/slot-type-reference.html#duration |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014075804/https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/slot-type-reference.html#duration |archive-date=2017-10-14 |access-date=2017-10-07 |website=Amazon Developer |publisher=Amazon.com}}</ref>\n\n==Time intervals==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| <start>/<end>\n|-\n| <start>/<duration>\n|-\n| <duration>/<end>\n|-\n| <duration>\n|}\nA time interval is the intervening time between two time points. The amount of intervening time is expressed by a duration (as described in the previous section). The two time points (start and end) are expressed by either a combined date and time representation or just a date representation.\n\nThere are four ways to express a time interval:\n\n#Start and end, such as \"2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z\"\n#Start and duration, such as \"2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M\"\n#Duration and end, such as \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z\"\n#Duration only, such as \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M\", with additional context information\n\nOf these, the first three require two values separated by an ''interval designator'' which is usually a solidus (more commonly referred to as a [[slash (punctuation)|forward slash]] \"/\"). Section 3.2.6 of ISO&nbsp;8601-1:2019 notes that \"A solidus may be replaced by a double hyphen [\"--\"] by mutual agreement of the communicating partners\", and previous versions used notations like \"2000--2002\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jkorpela.fi/iso8601.html |title=Info on ISO 8601, the date and time representation standard |publisher=Cs.tut.fi |access-date=2012-08-29 |archive-date=2017-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014035101/http://jkorpela.fi/iso8601.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Use of a double hyphen instead of a solidus allows inclusion in computer [[filename]]s;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrogold.com.au/news_2012.html#iso8601 |title=ISO 8601 - Getting with the Times (and Dates) |date=2012-01-01 |publisher=Hydrogold |access-date=2013-08-13 |archive-date=2014-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125104222/http://hydrogold.com.au/news_2012.html#iso8601 |url-status=live }}</ref> in common operating systems, a solidus is a [[Filename#Reserved characters and words|reserved character]] and is not allowed in a filename.\n\nFor <start>/<end> expressions, if any elements are missing from the end value, they are assumed to be the same as for the start value including the time zone. This feature of the standard allows for concise representations of time intervals. For example, the date of a two-hour meeting including the start and finish times could be simply shown as \"2007-12-14T13:30/15:30\", where \"/15:30\" implies \"/2007-12-14T15:30\" (the same date as the start), or the beginning and end dates of a monthly billing period as \"2008-02-15/03-14\", where \"/03-14\" implies \"/2008-03-14\" (the same year as the start).\n\nIf greater precision is desirable to represent the time interval, then more time elements can be added to the representation. An interval denoted {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13/15\"}} can start at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-13}} and end at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-15}}, whereas {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13T09:00/15T17:00\"}} includes the start and end times.\nTo explicitly include all of the start and end dates, the interval would be represented as {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13T00:00/16T00:00\"}}.\n\n===Repeating intervals===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| Rn/<interval>\n|-\n| R/<interval>\n|}\nRepeating intervals are specified in clause \"4.5 Recurring time interval\". They are formed by adding \"R[n]/\" to the beginning of an interval expression, where ''R'' is used as the letter itself and [n] is replaced by the number of repetitions. Leaving out the value for [n] or specifying a value of -1, means an unbounded number of repetitions. A value of 0 for [n] means the interval is not repeated.\n\nIf the interval specifies the start (forms 1 and 2 above), then this is the start of the repeating interval. If the interval specifies the end but not the start (form 3 above), then this is the end of the repeating interval. For example, to repeat the interval of \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M\" five times starting at {{nowrap|\"2008-03-01T13:00:00Z\"}}, use {{nowrap|\"R5/2008-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M\"}}.\n\n=={{anchor|Truncated representations}}Truncated representations (deprecated)==\n{{distinguish|#Reduced precision}}\n\nISO&nbsp;8601:2000 allowed truncation (by agreement), where leading components of a date or time are omitted. Notably, this allowed two-digit years to be used as well as the ambiguous formats YY-MM-DD and YYMMDD. This provision was removed in ISO&nbsp;8601:2004.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Some Truncated Representations (last valid in ISO&nbsp;8601:2000)\n|-\n! Type !! Basic format !! Basic example !!

Other formats have one leading <code>-</code> per omitted century, year, month, week, hour and minute as necessary to disambiguate the format.\n\n== Standardised extensions==\nISO&nbsp;8601-2:2019 defines a set of standardised extensions to the ISO&nbsp;8601 date and time formats.\n\n; {{anchor|EDTF}} Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF)\n: The EDTF is given as an example of a profile of ISO&nbsp;8601. Some of its features are:<ref name=\"EDTF_2019_Spec\"/>\n:* [[Uncertainty|Uncertain]] and approximate qualifiers, '?' and '~', as well as their combined used, '%'; they can be applied to the whole date or to individual components.\n:* Time intervals with an open (unbounded) end or an unknown end.\n:* Exponential and significant figure notation in years.\n:* Special \"month\" values indicating sub-year groupings such as seasons and quarters.\n:* Syntax for serializing a list of dates.\n: The EDTF features are described in the \"Date and Time Extensions\" section of ISO&nbsp;8601-2:2019.\n\n; Repeat rules for recurring time intervals\n: ISO&nbsp;8601-2:2019 also defines a format to constrain repeating intervals based on syntax from [[iCalendar]].<!-- We can use an example here. Maybe a rule for Easter day? -->\n\n==Usage==\nOn the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) uses the [[IETF]] standard based on ISO&nbsp;8601 in defining a profile of the standard that restricts the supported date and time formats to reduce the chance of error and the complexity of software. The very simple specification is based on a draft of the <nowiki>RFC 3339</nowiki> mentioned below.<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime Note about Date and Time Formats to W3C from Reuters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824114114/http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime |date=2011-08-24 }}<!--should be XML Schema--></ref>\n\nISO&nbsp;8601 is referenced by several specifications, but the full range of options of ISO&nbsp;8601 is not always used. For example, the various [[electronic program guide]] standards for TV, digital radio, etc. use several forms to describe points in time and durations. The [[ID3]] audio meta-data specification also makes use of a subset of ISO&nbsp;8601.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure|title=ID3 tag version 2.4.0 - Main Structure|last=Nilsson|first=M.|date=2000-11-01|publisher=id3.org|pages=§4|access-date=2009-09-27|archive-date=2015-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309021728/http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure}}</ref>\nThe [[X.690]] encoding standard's [[GeneralizedTime]] makes use of another subset of ISO&nbsp;8601.\n\n=== Commerce ===\nAs of 2006, the [[ISO week date]] appears in its basic form on major brand commercial packaging in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}} Its appearance depended on the particular packaging, canning, or bottling plant more than any particular brand.

This was a large increase, fully comparable to the speed improvements seven years later when the [[Intel 80486|i486]] (1989) or the original [[Pentium]] (1993) were introduced. This was partly due to the non-multiplexed address and data buses, but mainly to the fact that address calculations (such as [[addressing mode#Base plus index|base+index]]) were less expensive. They were performed by a dedicated unit in the 80286, while the older 8086 had to do effective address computation using its general [[arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], consuming several extra clock cycles in many cases. Also, the 80286 was more efficient in the prefetch of instructions, buffering, execution of jumps, and in complex [[microcode]]d numerical operations such as [[multiplication|MUL]]/[[division (mathematics)|DIV]] than its predecessor.<ref name=Bahadure2010>{{cite book |last=Bahadure |first=Nilesh B. |title=Microprocessors: 8086/8088, 80186/80286, 80386/80486 and the Pentium Family |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

The 80286 also added new instructions for protected mode: ARPL, CLTS, LAR, LGDT, LIDT, LLDT, LMSW, LSL, LTR, SGDT, SIDT, SLDT, SMSW, STR, VERR, and VERW.  Some of the instructions for protected mode can (or must) be used in real mode to set up and switch to protected mode, and a few (such as SMSW and LMSW) are useful for real mode itself.\n\nThe Intel 80286 had a 24-bit address bus and as such had a 16&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] physical [[address space]], compared to the 1&nbsp;MB address space of prior x86 processors.  It was the first x86 processor to support [[virtual memory]] supporting up to 1&nbsp;GB via segmentation.<ref>Intel Corporation, \"New Product Focus Components: Highest Ranking 16-bit Microprocessor Meets Military Objectives\", Solutions, September/October 1985, page 13</ref>  However, memory cost and the initial rarity of software using the memory above 1&nbsp;MB meant that until late in its production, 80286 computers rarely shipped with more than 1&nbsp;MB  of RAM.<ref name=Bahadure2010/> Additionally, there was a performance penalty involved in accessing extended memory from real mode as noted below.\n\n==Features==\n[[File:80286-processor-made-in-austria.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Siemens 80286 (10&nbsp;MHz version)]]\n[[File:KL IBM 80286.jpg|thumb|150px|right|IBM 80286 (8&nbsp;MHz version)]]\n\n===Protected mode===\nThe 286 was the first of the x86 CPU family to support ''protected virtual-address mode'', commonly called \"[[protected mode]]\". In addition, it was the first commercially available microprocessor with on-chip [[memory management unit|MMU]] capabilities (systems using the contemporaneous [[Motorola 68010]] and [[NS320xx]] could be equipped with an optional MMU controller).  This would allow IBM compatibles to have advanced multitasking OSes for the first time and compete in the [[Unix]]-dominated{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} [[network server|server]]/[[workstation]] market.\n\nSeveral additional instructions were introduced in the protected mode of 80286, which are helpful for multitasking operating systems.\n\nAnother important feature of 80286 is the prevention of unauthorized access. This is achieved by:\n* Forming different segments for data, code, and stack, and preventing their overlapping.\n* Assigning privilege levels to each segment. Segments with lower privilege levels cannot access segments with higher privilege levels.\n\nIn 80286 (and in its co-processor [[Intel 80287]]), arithmetic operations can be performed on the following different types of numbers:\n* unsigned [[packed decimal]],\n* unsigned binary,\n* unsigned unpacked decimal,\n* signed binary,\n* [[floating-point number]]s (only with an [[80287]]).\n\nBy design, the 286 could not revert from protected mode to the basic 8086-compatible ''real address mode'' (\"[[real mode]]\") without a hardware-initiated reset. In the PC/AT introduced in 1984, IBM added external circuitry, as well as specialized code in the [[ROM BIOS]] and the [[8042]] keyboard microcontroller to enable software to cause the reset, allowing real-mode reentry while retaining active memory and returning control to the program that initiated the reset. (The BIOS is necessarily involved because it obtains control directly whenever the CPU resets.) Though it worked correctly, the method imposed a huge performance penalty.\n\nIn theory, real-mode applications could be [[protected mode#Real mode application compatibility|directly executed in 16-bit protected mode]] if certain rules (newly proposed with the introduction of the 80286) were followed; however, as many DOS programs did not conform to those rules, protected mode was not widely used until the appearance of its successor, the [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] [[Intel 80386]], which was designed to go back and forth between modes easily and to provide an emulation of real mode within protected mode. When Intel designed the 286, it was not designed to be able to multitask real-mode applications; real mode was intended to be a simple way for a bootstrap loader to prepare the system and then switch to protected mode; essentially, in protected mode the 80286 was designed to be a new processor with many similarities to its predecessors, while real mode on the 80286 was offered for smaller-scale systems that could benefit from a more advanced version of the 80186 CPU core, with advantages such as higher clock rates, faster instruction execution (measured in clock cycles), and unmultiplexed buses, but not the 24-bit (16 MB) memory space.\n\nTo support protected mode, new instructions have been added: ARPL, VERR, VERW, LAR, LSL, SMSW, SGDT, SIDT, SLDT, STR, LMSW, LGDT, LIDT, LLDT, LTR, CLTS.  There are also new exceptions (internal interrupts): invalid opcode, coprocessor not available, double fault, coprocessor segment overrun, stack fault, segment overrun/general protection fault, and others only for protected mode.\n\n===OS support===\nThe protected mode of the 80286 was not routinely utilized in PC applications until many years after its release, in part because of the high cost of adding extended memory to a PC, but also because of the need for software to support the large user base of 8086 PCs. For example, in 1986 the only program that made use of it was VDISK, a [[RAM disk]] driver included with [[PC DOS]] 3.0 and 3.1. A [[DOS]] could utilize the additional RAM available in protected mode ([[extended memory]]) either via a [[BIOS]] call (INT 15h, AH=87h), as a [[RAM disk]], or as [[emulator|emulation]] of [[expanded memory]].<ref name=Bahadure2010/> The difficulty lay in the incompatibility of older [[real-mode]] DOS programs with protected mode. They simply could not natively run in this new mode without significant modification. In protected mode, memory management and interrupt handling were done differently than in real mode. In addition, DOS programs typically would directly access data and code segments that did not belong to them, as real mode allowed them to do without restriction; in contrast, the design intent of protected mode was to prevent programs from accessing any segments other than their own unless special access was explicitly allowed. While it was possible to set up a protected-mode environment that allowed all programs access to all segments (by putting all segment descriptors into the GDT and assigning them all the same privilege level), this undermined nearly all of the advantages of protected mode except the extended (24-bit) address space. The choice that OS developers faced was either to start from scratch and create an OS that would not run the vast majority of the old programs, or to come up with a version of DOS that was slow and ugly (i.e., ugly from an internal technical viewpoint) but would still run a majority of the old programs. Protected mode also did not provide a significant enough performance advantage over the 8086-compatible real mode to justify supporting its capabilities; actually, except for task switches when multitasking, it actually yielded only a performance disadvantage, by slowing down many instructions through a litany of added privilege checks. In protected mode, registers were still 16-bit, and the programmer was still forced to use a memory map composed of 64&nbsp;kB segments, just like in real mode.<ref name=PCMAG1986>{{cite journal |author-last=Petzold |author-first=Charles |author-link=Charles Petzold |title=Obstacles to a grown up operating system |journal=PC Magazine |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=170–74 |year=1986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDGnxFyejN4C&pg=PA170 |access-date=October 11, 2016 |archive-date=February 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227081813/https://books.google.com/books?id=pDGnxFyejN4C&pg=PA170 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn January 1985, [[Digital Research]] previewed the [[Concurrent DOS 286]] 1.0 operating system developed in cooperation with [[Intel]].

Intel designed the 8086 to have its [[assembly language]] be similar enough to the 8080, with most instructions mapping directly onto each other, that [[Source-to-source compiler|transpiled]] 8080 assembly code could be executed on the 8086.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mazor |first1=Stanley |title=The Intel 8086 Microprocessor: a 16-bit Evolution of the 8080 |journal=IEEE Computer |date=June 1978 |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=18–27 |doi=10.1109/C-M.1978.218219 |s2cid=16962774 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5430762 |access-date=November 18, 2021 |archive-date=September 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210919153639/https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5430762 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nMicroprocessor customers were reluctant to adopt the 8008 because of limitations such as the single addressing mode, low clock speed, low pin count, and small on-chip stack, which restricted the scale and complexity of software. There were several proposed designs for the 8080, ranging from simply adding stack instructions to the 8008 to a complete departure from all previous Intel architectures.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Michael |title=Creating the 8080: The Processor That Started the PC Revolution |url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/creating-the-8080-the-processor-that-started-the-pc-revolution |website=PCMag |publisher=Zaff Davis |access-date=14 November 2021 |archive-date=November 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211114174610/https://www.pcmag.com/news/creating-the-8080-the-processor-that-started-the-pc-revolution |url-status=live }}</ref> The final design was a compromise between the proposals.\n\n[[Federico Faggin]], the originator of the 8080 architecture in early 1972, proposed the chip to Intel's management and pushed for its implementation. He finally got the permission to develop it six months later. Faggin hired [[Masatoshi Shima]], who helped design the 4004 with him, from Japan in November 1972. Shima did the detailed design under Faggin's direction,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Faggin |first1=Federico |title=8008 and 8080 Q&A |url=https://sites.google.com/site/microprocessorintel4004/8008-8080-q-a |website=Microprocessor Intel 4004 |access-date=15 November 2021 |archive-date=November 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211115233233/https://sites.google.com/site/microprocessorintel4004/8008-8080-q-a |url-status=live }}</ref> using the design methodology for random logic with silicon gate that Faggin had created for the 4000 family. \n\nThe 8080 was explicitly designed to be a general-purpose microprocessor for a larger number of customers. Much of the development effort was spent trying to integrate the functionalities of the 8008's supplemental chips into one package. It was decided early in development that the 8080 was not to be binary-compatible with the 8008, instead opting for source compatibility once run through a transpiler, to allow new software to not be subject to the same restrictions as the 8008. For the same reason, as well as the expand the capabilities of stack-based routines and interrupts, the stack was moved to external memory. \n\nNoting the specialized use of general-purpose registers by programmers in mainframe systems, [[Stanley Mazor]], the chip architect, decided the 8080's registers would be specialized, with register pairs having a different set of uses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mazor |first1=Stanley |title=Intel 8080 CPU Chip Development |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |date=April–June 2007 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=70–73 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.2007.25|s2cid=14755544 }}</ref> This also allowed the engineers to more effectively use transistors for other purposes. \n\nShima finished the layout in August 1973. After the regulation of NMOS fabrication, a prototype of the 8080 was completed in January 1974. It had a flaw, in that driving with standard TTL devices increased the ground voltage because high current flowed into the narrow line. Intel had already produced 40,000 units of the 8080 at the direction of the sales section before Shima characterized the prototype. It was released as requiring Low-power Schottky TTL (LS TTL) devices. The 8080A fixed this flaw.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Shima|first1=Masatoshi|author-link=Masatoshi Shima|last2=Nishimura|first2=Hirohiko|last3=Ishida|first3=Haruhisa|year=1979|title=座談会 マイクロコンピュータの誕生 開発者 嶋 正利氏に聞く|journal=Bit|language=ja|publisher=共立出版|volume=11|issue=11|pages=4–12|issn=0385-6984}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|INTERP}}Intel offered an [[instruction set simulator]] for the 8080 named INTERP/80 to run compiled [[PL/M]] programs.

It uses the same basic [[instruction set]] and [[Processor register|register]] model as the 8008, although it is neither [[Source-code compatibility|source code compatible]] nor [[Binary-code compatibility|binary code compatible]] with its predecessor. Every instruction in the 8008 has an equivalent instruction in the 8080. The 8080 also adds 16-bit operations in its instruction set. Whereas the 8008 required the use of the HL register pair to indirectly access its 14-bit memory space, the 8080 added addressing modes to allow direct access to its full 16-bit memory space. The internal 7-level push-down [[call stack]] of the 8008 was replaced by a dedicated 16-bit stack-pointer (SP) register. The 8080's 40-pin [[Dual in-line package|DIP packaging]] permits it to provide a 16-bit [[address bus]] and an 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]], enabling access to 64&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]] (2<sup>16</sup> bytes) of memory.\n\n====Registers====\nThe processor has seven 8-bit [[processor register|registers]] (A, B, C, D, E, H, and L), where A is the primary 8-bit accumulator. The other six registers can be used as either individual 8-bit registers or in three 16-bit register pairs (BC, DE, and HL, referred to as B, D and H in Intel documents) depending on the particular instruction. Some instructions also enable the HL register pair to be used as a (limited) 16-bit accumulator. A pseudo-register M, which refers to the dereferenced memory location pointed to by HL, can be used almost anywhere other registers can be used. The 8080 has a 16-bit [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack pointer]] to memory, replacing the 8008's internal [[stack (data structure)|stack]], and a 16-bit [[program counter]].\n\n====Flags====\nThe processor maintains internal [[flag word|flag bits]] (a [[status register]]), which indicate the results of arithmetic and logical instructions. Only certain instructions affect the flags. The flags are:\n* [[Sign flag|Sign]] (S), set if the result is negative.\n* [[Zero flag|Zero]] (Z), set if the result is zero.\n* [[Parity flag|Parity]] (P), set if the number of 1 bits in the result is even.\n* [[Carry flag|Carry]] (C), set if the last addition operation resulted in a carry or if the last subtraction operation required a borrow\n* [[Half-carry flag|Auxiliary carry]] (AC or H), used for [[binary-coded decimal]] arithmetic (BCD).\n\nThe carry bit can be set or complemented by specific instructions. Conditional-branch instructions test the various flag status bits. The accumulator and the flags together are called the PSW, or program status word. PSW can be pushed to or popped from the stack.\n\n====Commands, instructions====\nAs with many other 8-bit processors, all instructions are encoded in one byte (including register numbers, but excluding immediate data), for simplicity. Some can be followed by one or two bytes of data, which can be an immediate operand, a memory address, or a port number. Like more advanced processors, it has automatic CALL and RET instructions for multi-level procedure calls and returns (which can even be conditionally executed, like jumps) and instructions to save and restore any 16-bit register pair on the machine stack. Eight one-byte call instructions ({{code|RST}}) for subroutines exist at the fixed addresses 00h, 08h, 10h, ..., 38h. These are intended to be supplied by external hardware in order to invoke a corresponding [[interrupt service routine]], but are also often employed as fast [[system call]]s. The instruction that executes slowest is {{code|XTHL}}, which is used for exchanging the register pair HL with the value stored at the address indicated by the stack pointer.\n\n=====8-bit instructions=====\nAll 8-bit operations with two operands can only be performed on the 8-bit [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator]] (the A register). The other operand can be either an immediate value, another 8-bit register, or a memory byte addressed by the 16-bit register pair HL. Increments and decrements can be performed on any 8 bit register or an HL-addressed memory byte. Direct copying is supported between any two 8-bit registers and between any 8-bit register and an HL-addressed memory byte. Due to the regular encoding of the {{code|MOV}} instruction (using a quarter of available opcode space), there are redundant codes to copy a register into itself ({{code|MOV B,B}}, for instance), which are of little use, except for delays. However, the systematic opcode for {{code|MOV M,M}} is instead used to encode the halt ([[HLT (x86 instruction)|{{code|HLT}}]]) instruction, halting execution until an external reset or interrupt occurs.\n\n=====16-bit operations=====\nAlthough the 8080 is generally an 8-bit processor, it has limited abilities to perform 16-bit operations. Any of the three 16-bit register pairs (BC, DE, or HL, referred to as B, D, H in Intel documents) or SP can be loaded with an immediate 16-bit value (using {{code|LXI}}), incremented or decremented (using {{code|INX}} and {{code|DCX}}), or added to HL (using {{code|DAD}}). By adding HL to itself, it is possible to achieve the same result as a 16-bit arithmetical left shift with one instruction. The only 16-bit instructions that affect any flag is {{code|DAD}}, which sets the CY (carry) flag in order to allow for programmed 24-bit or 32-bit [[arithmetic]] (or larger), needed to implement [[floating-point arithmetic]]. A stack frame can be allocated using {{code|DAD SP}} and {{code|SPHL}}. A branch to a computed pointer can be executed with {{code|PCHL}}. {{code|LHLD}} loads HL from directly addressed memory and {{code|SHLD}} stores HL likewise.

ClassicCMP.org. Retrieved on October 23, 2011.</ref> instruction exchanges the values of the HL and DE register pairs. {{code|XTHL}}exchanges last item pushed on stack with HL.\n\n===Input/output scheme===\n\n====Input output port space====\nThe 8080 supports up to 256<ref>Note: Some Intel datasheets from the 1970s advertise 512 I/O ports, because they count input and output ports separately.</ref> [[input/output]] (I/O) ports, accessed via dedicated I/O instructions taking port addresses as operands.<ref>{{cite book |title=Computer Architecture and Organization |last1=HAYES\n  |first1=JOHN P. |isbn=0-07-027363-4 |year=1978 |date= |publisher= |pages=420-423 }}</ref> This I/O mapping scheme is regarded as an advantage, as it frees up the processor's limited address space. Many CPU architectures instead use so-called [[memory-mapped I/O]] (MMIO), in which a common address space is used for both RAM and peripheral chips. This removes the need for dedicated I/O instructions, although a drawback in such designs may be that special hardware must be used to insert wait states, as peripherals are often slower than memory. However, in some simple 8080 computers, I/O is indeed addressed as if they were memory cells, \"memory-mapped\", leaving the I/O commands unused. I/O addressing can also sometimes employ the fact that the processor outputs the same 8-bit port address to both the lower and the higher address byte (i.e., {{code|IN 05h}} would put the address 0505h on the 16-bit address bus). Similar I/O-port schemes are used in the backward-compatible Zilog Z80 and Intel 8085, and the closely related x86 microprocessor families.\n\n====Separate stack space====\nOne of the bits in the processor state word (see below) indicates that the processor is accessing data from the stack. Using this signal, it is possible to implement a separate stack memory space. This feature is seldom used.\n\n===The internal state word===\nFor more advanced systems, during one phase of its working loop, the processor set its \"internal state byte\" on the data bus. This byte contains flags that determine whether the memory or I/O port is accessed and whether it is necessary to handle an interrupt.\n\nThe interrupt system state (enabled or disabled) is also output on a separate pin. For simple systems, where the interrupts are not used, it is possible to find cases where this pin is used as an additional single-bit output port (the popular [[Radio-86RK]] computer made in the [[Soviet Union]], for instance).\n\n===Example code===\nThe following 8080/8085 [[assembly language|assembler]] source code is for a subroutine named {{code|memcpy}} that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. The data block is copied one byte at a time, and the data movement and looping logic utilizes 16-bit operations.\n\n<!--This code is not intended to be optimized, but to illustrate the variety of instructions available on the CPU. Still, it must be correct.-->\n{|\n|\n<pre>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1000\n1000\n1000  78\n1001  B1\n1002  C8\n1003  1A\n1004  77\n1005  13\n1006  23\n1007  0B\n1008  78\n1009  B1\n100A  C2 03 10\n100D  C9\n</pre>\n|\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"nasm\">\n; memcpy --\n; Copy a block of memory from one location to another.\n;\n; Entry registers\n;       BC - Number of bytes to copy\n;       DE - Address of source data block\n;       HL - Address of target data block\n;\n; Return registers\n;       BC - Zero\n\n            org     1000h       ;Origin at 1000h\nmemcpy      public\n            mov     a,b         ;Copy register B to register A\n            ora     c           ;Bitwise OR of A and C into register A\n            rz                  ;Return if the zero-flag is set high.\nloop:       ldax    d           ;Load A from the address pointed by DE\n            mov     m,a         ;Store A into the address pointed by HL\n            inx     d           ;Increment DE\n            inx     h           ;Increment HL\n            dcx     b           ;Decrement BC   (does not affect Flags)\n            mov     a,b         ;Copy B to A    (so as to compare BC with zero)\n            ora     c           ;A = A | C      (are both B and C zero?)\n            jnz     loop        ;Jump to 'loop:' if the zero-flag is not set.   \n            ret                 ;Return\n</syntaxhighlight>\n|}\n\n===Pin use===\n[[File:Intel 8080 Microprocessor.png|thumb|300px|8080 Pinout]]\n\nThe address bus has its own 16 pins, and the data bus has 8 pins that are usable without any multiplexing. Using the two additional pins (read and write signals), it is possible to assemble simple microprocessor devices very easily. Only the separate IO space, interrupts, and DMA need added chips to decode the processor pin signals. However, the pin load capacity is limited; even simple computers often require bus amplifiers.\n\nThe processor needs three power sources (−5, +5, and +12&nbsp;V) and two non-overlapping high-amplitude synchronizing signals. However, at least the late Soviet version КР580ВМ80А was able to work with a single +5&nbsp;V power source, the +12&nbsp;V pin being connected to +5&nbsp;V and the −5&nbsp;V pin to ground.\n\nThe pin-out table, from the chip's accompanying documentation, describes the pins as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n ! Pin number\n ! Signal\n ! Type\n ! Comment\n |-\n | 1 || A10\n | Output || Address bus 10\n |-\n | 2 || GND\n | — || Ground\n |-\n | 3 || D4\n | rowspan=\"8\" | Bidirectional\n | rowspan=\"8\" | Bidirectional data bus. The processor also transiently sets here the \"processor state\", providing information about what the processor is currently doing:\n*D0 reading interrupt command. In response to the interrupt signal, the processor is reading and executing a single arbitrary command with this flag raised. Normally the supporting chips provide the subroutine call command (CALL or RST), transferring control to the interrupt handling code.\n*D1 reading (low level means writing)\n*D2 accessing stack (probably a separate stack memory space was initially planned)\n*D3 doing nothing, has been halted by the [[HLT (x86 instruction)|HLT]] instruction\n*D4 writing data to an output port\n*D5 reading the first byte of an executable instruction\n*D6 reading data from an input port\n*D7 reading data from memory\n |-\n | 4 || D5\n |-\n | 5 || D6\n |-\n | 6 || D7\n |-\n | 7 || D3\n |-\n | 8 || D2\n |-\n | 9 || D1\n |-\n | 10 || D0\n |-\n | 11 || −5 V\n | — || The −5 V power supply.

One of the early uses of the 8080 was made in the late 1970s by Cubic-Western Data of San Diego, California, in its Automated Fare Collection Systems custom designed for mass transit systems around the world. An early industrial use of the 8080 is as the \"brain\" of the DatagraphiX Auto-COM (Computer Output Microfiche) line of products which takes large amounts of user data from reel-to-reel tape and images it onto microfiche. The Auto-COM instruments also include an entire automated film cutting, processing, washing, and drying sub-system.\n\nSeveral early video [[arcade game]]s were built around the 8080 microprocessor.

At Intel, the 8080 was followed by the compatible and electrically more elegant [[Intel 8085|8085]].\n\nLater, Intel issued the assembly-language compatible (but not binary-compatible) 16-bit [[Intel 8086|8086]] and then the 8/16-bit [[Intel 8088|8088]], which was selected by [[IBM]] for its new [[IBM PC|PC]] to be launched in 1981. Later [[NEC]] made the [[NEC V20]] (an 8088 clone with [[Intel 80186]] instruction set compatibility) which also supports an 8080 emulation mode.

When the 8080 was introduced, computer systems were usually created by computer manufacturers such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], or [[IBM]]. A manufacturer would produce the whole computer, including processor, terminals, and system software such as compilers and operating system. The 8080 was designed for almost any application ''except'' a complete computer system. Hewlett-Packard developed the [[HP 2640]] series of smart terminals around the 8080. The [[HP 2647]] is a terminal which runs the programming language [[BASIC]] on the 8080.

The 8080 device was eventually replaced by the [[Depletion-load NMOS logic|depletion-load]]-based [[Intel 8085|8085]] (1977), which sufficed with a single +5&nbsp;V power supply instead of the three different operating voltages of earlier chips.<ref group=\"note\">Made possible with depletion-load nMOS logic (the 8085 was later made using HMOS processing, just like the 8086).</ref> Other well known 8-bit microprocessors that emerged during these years are [[Motorola 6800]] (1974), [[PIC microcontroller|General Instrument PIC16X]] (1975), [[MOS Technology 6502]] (1975), [[Zilog Z80]] (1976), and [[Motorola 6809]] (1978).\n\n===The first x86 design===\n[[File:Intel 8086 CPU Die.JPG|thumb|Intel 8086 CPU die image]]\nThe 8086 project started in May 1976 and was originally intended as a temporary substitute for the ambitious and delayed [[iAPX 432]] project. It was an attempt to draw attention from the less-delayed 16-bit and [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] processors of other manufacturers — [[Motorola]], [[Zilog]], and [[National Semiconductor]].\n\nWhereas the 8086 was a 16-bit microprocessor, it used the same [[microarchitecture]] as Intel's 8-bit microprocessors (8008, 8080, and 8085). This allowed [[assembly language]] programs written in 8-bit to [[Assembly language translator|seamlessly migrate]].<ref name=\"Scanlon_1988\"/> New instructions and features — such as signed integers, base+offset addressing, and self-repeating operations — were added. Instructions were added to assist source code compilation of [[nested function]]s in the [[ALGOL]]-family of languages, including [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[PL/M]]. According to principal architect [[Stephen P. Morse]], this was a result of a more software-centric approach. Other enhancements included [[microcode]] instructions for the multiply and divide assembly language instructions. Designers also anticipated [[coprocessors]], such as [[Intel 8087|8087]] and [[Intel 8089|8089]], so the bus structure was designed to be flexible.\n\nThe first revision of the instruction set and high level architecture was ready after about three months,<ref group=\"note\" >Rev.0 of the instruction set and architecture was ready in about three months, according to Morse.</ref> and as almost no CAD tools were used, four engineers and 12&nbsp;layout people were simultaneously working on the chip.<ref group=\"note\" >Using [[rubylith]], light boards, rulers, electric erasers, and a [[digitizer]] (according to Jenny Hernandez, member of the 8086 design team, in a statement made on Intel's webpage for its 25th birthday).</ref> The 8086 took a little more than two years from idea to working product, which was considered rather fast for a complex design in 1976–1978.\n\nThe 8086 was sequenced<ref group=\"note\" >8086 used less microcode than many competitors' designs, such as the MC68000 and others</ref> using a mixture of [[random logic]]<ref>{{cite book |first1=Randall L. |last1=Geiger |first2=Phillip E. |last2=Allen |first3=Noel R. |last3=Strader |title=VLSI design techniques for analog and digital circuits |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1990 |isbn=0-07-023253-9 |pages=779 |chapter=Random Logic vs. Structured Logic Forms}} — Illustration of use of \"random\" describing CPU control logic</ref> and [[microcode]] and was implemented using depletion-load nMOS circuitry with approximately 20,000&nbsp;active [[transistor]]s (29,000 counting all [[read-only memory|ROM]] and [[Programmable logic array|PLA]] sites). It was soon moved to a new refined nMOS manufacturing process called [[HMOS]] (for High performance MOS) that Intel originally developed for manufacturing of fast [[static RAM]] products.<ref group=\"note\" >Fast static RAMs in MOS technology (as fast as bipolar RAMs) was an important product for Intel during this period.</ref> This was followed by HMOS-II, HMOS-III versions, and, eventually, a fully static [[CMOS]] version for battery powered devices, manufactured using Intel's [[CHMOS]] processes.<ref group=\"note\" >CHMOS is Intel's name for CMOS circuits manufactured using processing steps very similar to [[HMOS]].</ref> The original chip measured 33&nbsp;mm² and minimum feature size was 3.2&nbsp;μm.\n\nThe architecture was defined by [[Stephen P. Morse]] with some help from Bruce Ravenel (the architect of the 8087) in refining the final revisions. Logic designer Jim McKevitt and John Bayliss were the lead engineers of the hardware-level development team<ref group=\"note\" >Other members of the design team were Peter A.Stoll and Jenny Hernandez.</ref> and Bill Pohlman the manager for the project. The legacy of the 8086 is enduring in the basic instruction set of today's personal computers and servers; the 8086 also lent its last two digits to later extended versions of the design, such as the [[Intel 286]] and the [[Intel 386]], all of which eventually became known as the [[x86]] family. (Another reference is that the [[PCI Configuration Space|PCI Vendor ID]] for Intel devices is 8086<sub>h</sub>.)\n\n==Details==\n[[File:Intel 8086 pinout.svg|thumb|300px|The 8086 pin assignments in min and max mode]]\n\n===Buses and operation===\nAll internal registers, as well as internal and external data buses, are 16&nbsp;bits wide, which firmly established the \"16-bit microprocessor\" identity of the 8086. A 20-bit external address bus provides a 1&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]] physical address space (2<sup>20</sup> = 1,048,576 x 1 [[byte]]). This address space is addressed by means of internal memory \"segmentation\". The data bus is [[multiplexed]] with the address bus in order to fit all of the control lines into a standard 40-pin [[dual in-line package]]. It provides a 16-bit I/O address bus, supporting 64&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] of separate I/O space. The maximum linear address space is limited to 64&nbsp;KB, simply because internal address/index registers are only 16&nbsp;bits wide. Programming over 64&nbsp;KB memory boundaries involves adjusting the segment registers (see below); this difficulty existed until the [[80386]] architecture introduced wider (32-bit) registers (the memory management hardware in the [[80286]] did not help in this regard, as its registers are still only 16 bits wide).\n\n===Hardware modes of 8086===\nSome of the control pins, which carry essential signals for all external operations, have more than one function depending upon whether the device is operated in ''min'' or ''max'' mode. The former mode is intended for small single-processor systems, while the latter is for medium or large systems using more than one processor (a kind of multiprocessor mode). Maximum mode is required when using an 8087 or 8089 coprocessor. The voltage on pin 33 (MN/{{overline|MX}}) determines the mode. Changing the state of pin 33 changes the function of certain other pins, most of which have to do with how the CPU handles the (local) bus.<ref group=\"note\" >The IBM PC and PC/XT use an Intel 8088 running in maximum mode, which allows the CPU to work with an optional 8087 coprocessor installed in the math coprocessor socket on the PC or PC/XT mainboard. (The PC and PC/XT may require maximum mode for other reasons, such as perhaps to support the DMA controller.)</ref> The mode is usually hardwired into the circuit and therefore cannot be changed by software. The workings of these modes are described in terms of timing diagrams in Intel datasheets and manuals. In minimum mode, all control signals are generated by the 8086 itself.\n\n===Registers and instruction===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%;width:38em;\"\n|-\n|+ Intel 8086 registers\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:10px;

Four of them, AX, BX, CX, DX, can also be accessed as twice as many 8-bit registers (see figure) while the other four, SI, DI, BP, SP, are 16-bit only.\n\nDue to a compact encoding inspired by 8-bit processors, most instructions are one-address or two-address operations, which means that the result is stored in one of the operands. At most one of the operands can be in memory, but this memory operand can also be the ''destination'', while the other operand, the ''source'', can be either ''register'' or ''immediate''. A single memory location can also often be used as both ''source'' and ''destination'' which, among other factors, further contributes to a [[code density]] comparable to (and often better than) most eight-bit machines at the time.\n\nThe degree of generality of most registers is much greater than in the 8080 or 8085. However, 8086 registers were more specialized than in most contemporary [[minicomputer]]s and are also used implicitly by some instructions. While perfectly sensible for the assembly programmer, this makes register allocation for compilers more complicated compared to more orthogonal 16-bit and 32-bit processors of the time such as the [[PDP-11]], [[VAX]], [[68000]], [[32016]], etc. On the other hand, being more regular than the rather minimalistic but ubiquitous 8-bit microprocessors such as the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], [[Motorola 6800|6800]], [[6809]], [[Intel 8085|8085]], [[MCS-48]], [[Intel 8051|8051]], and other contemporary accumulator-based machines, it is significantly easier to construct an efficient [[code generation (compiler)|code generator]] for the 8086 architecture.\n\nAnother factor for this is that the 8086 also introduced some new instructions (not present in the 8080 and 8085) to better support stack-based high-level programming languages such as Pascal and [[PL/M]]; some of the more useful instructions are <code>'''push''' ''mem-op''</code>, and '''ret''' ''size'', supporting the \"Pascal [[calling convention]]\" directly. (Several others, such as <code>'''push'''&nbsp;''immed''</code> and <code>'''enter'''</code>, were added in the subsequent 80186, 80286, and 80386 processors.)\n\nA 64&nbsp;KB (one segment) [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] growing towards lower addresses is supported in [[computer hardware|hardware]]; 16-bit words are pushed onto the stack, and the top of the stack is pointed to by SS:SP. There are 256&nbsp;[[interrupt]]s, which can be invoked by both hardware and software. The interrupts can cascade, using the stack to store the [[return address (computing)|return address]]es.\n\nThe 8086 has 64&nbsp;K of 8-bit (or alternatively 32&nbsp;K of 16-bit word) [[I/O port]] space.\n\n===Flags===\nThe 8086 has a 16-bit [[status register|flags register]]. Nine of these condition code flags are active, and indicate the current state of the processor: [[Carry flag]] (CF), [[Parity flag]] (PF), [[Auxiliary flag|Auxiliary carry flag]] (AF), [[Zero flag]] (ZF), [[Sign flag]] (SF), [[Trap flag]] (TF), [[IF (x86 flag)|Interrupt flag]] (IF), [[Direction flag]] (DF), and [[Overflow flag]] (OF).\nAlso referred to as the status word, the layout of the flags register is as follows:<ref>{{Cite book |title=IAPX 86, 88, 186, and 188 user's manual : programmer's reference |author=Intel Corporation |year=1983 |isbn=978-0835930352 |oclc=11091251 |pages=3–5}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Rather than concatenating the segment register with the address register, as in most processors whose address space exceeds their register size, the 8086 shifts the 16-bit segment only four bits left before adding it to the 16-bit offset (16×segment + offset), therefore producing a 20-bit external (or effective or physical) address from the 32-bit segment:offset pair. As a result, each external address can be referred to by 2<sup>12</sup> = 4096 different segment:offset pairs.\n\n{| style=\"margin-left:5em\"\n|-\n| <code>&nbsp; </code><code style=\"background:#DED\">0110 1000 1000 0111</code><code>0000</code>\n| '''Segment''',\n| 16 bits, shifted 4 bits left (or multiplied by 0x10)\n|-\n| <code>+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </code><code style=\"background:#DDF\">1011 0100 1010 1001</code>\n| '''Offset''',\n| 16 bits\n|- style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"\n| <code>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>\n|\n|-\n| <code>&nbsp; </code><code style=\"background:#FDF\">0111 0011 1101 0001 1001</code>\n| '''Address''',\n| 20 bits\n|}\n\nAlthough considered complicated and cumbersome by many programmers, this scheme also has advantages; a small program (less than 64&nbsp;KB) can be loaded starting at a fixed offset (such as 0000) in its own segment, avoiding the need for [[Relocation (computing)|relocation]], with at most 15&nbsp;bytes of alignment waste.\n\nCompilers for the 8086 family commonly support two types of [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]], ''near'' and ''far''. Near pointers are 16-bit offsets implicitly associated with the program's code or data segment and so can be used only within parts of a program small enough to fit in one segment. Far pointers are 32-bit segment:offset pairs resolving to 20-bit external addresses. Some compilers also support ''huge'' pointers, which are like far pointers except that [[pointer arithmetic]] on a huge pointer treats it as a linear 20-bit pointer, while pointer arithmetic on a far pointer [[integer overflow|wraps around]] within its 16-bit offset without touching the segment part of the address.\n\nTo avoid the need to specify ''near'' and ''far'' on numerous pointers, data structures, and functions, compilers also support \"memory models\" which specify default pointer sizes. The ''tiny'' (max 64K), ''small'' (max 128K), ''compact'' (data > 64K), ''medium'' (code > 64K), ''large'' (code,data > 64K), and ''huge'' (individual arrays > 64K) models cover practical combinations of near, far, and huge pointers for code and data. The ''tiny'' model means that code and data are shared in a single segment, just as in most 8-bit based processors, and can be used to build ''[[COM file|.com]]'' files for instance. Precompiled libraries often come in several versions compiled for different memory models.\n\nAccording to Morse et al.,.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Stephen P. |last1=Morse |first2=Bruce W |last2=Ravenel |first3=Stanley |last3=Mazor |first4=William B. |last4=Pohlman |title=Intel Microprocessors: 8008 to 8086 |journal=IEEE Computer |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=42–60 |date=October 1980 |doi=10.1109/MC.1980.1653375 |s2cid=206445851 |url=https://stevemorse.org/8086history/8086history.doc}}</ref> the designers actually contemplated using an 8-bit shift (instead of 4-bit), in order to create a 16&nbsp;MB physical address space. However, as this would have forced segments to begin on 256-byte boundaries, and 1&nbsp;MB was considered very large for a microprocessor around 1976, the idea was dismissed. Also, there were not enough pins available on a low cost 40-pin package for the additional four address bus pins.\n\nIn principle, the address space of the x86 series ''could'' have been extended in later processors by increasing the shift value, as long as applications obtained their segments from the operating system and did not make assumptions about the equivalence of different segment:offset pairs.<ref group=\"note\" >Some 80186 clones did change the shift value, but were never commonly used in desktop computers.</ref> In practice the use of \"huge\" pointers and similar mechanisms was widespread and the flat 32-bit addressing made possible with the 32-bit offset registers in the 80386 eventually extended the limited addressing range in a more general way.\n\nThe instruction stream is fetched from memory as words and is addressed internally by the processor to the byte level as necessary. An instruction stream queuing mechanism allows up to 6 bytes of the instruction stream to be queued while waiting for decoding and execution. The queue acts as a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer, from which the Execution Unit (EU) extracts instruction bytes as required. Whenever there is space for at least two bytes in the queue, the BIU will attempt a word fetch memory cycle.  If the queue is empty (following a branch instruction, for example), the first byte into the queue immediately becomes available to the EU.<ref name=\"8086Datasheet\">{{cite web |title=8086 16-BIT HMOS Processor datasheet |url=https://cdn.datasheetspdf.com/pdf-down/8/0/8/8086_Intel.pdf |publisher=Intel |access-date=26 November 2021}}</ref>\n\n====Porting older software====\nSmall programs could ignore the segmentation and just use plain 16-bit addressing. This allows [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] software to be quite easily ported to the 8086. The authors of most [[DOS]] implementations took advantage of this by providing an [[Application Programming Interface]] very similar to [[CP/M]] as well as including the simple ''.com'' executable file format, identical to CP/M. This was important when the 8086 and MS-DOS were new, because it allowed many existing CP/M (and other) applications to be quickly made available, greatly easing acceptance of the new platform.\n\n== Example code ==\nThe following 8086 [[assembly language|assembly]] source code is for a subroutine named <code>_strtolower</code> that copies a null-terminated [[ASCIIZ]] character string from one location to another, converting all alphabetic characters to lower case. The string is copied one byte (8-bit character) at a time.\n\n<!--NOTE: The hex codes were assembled by hand, so there may be errors-->\n{|\n|\n<!--NOTE: DO NOT REMOVE BLANK LINES, 0000 line sets block width--><pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0000            \n0000  55\n0001  89 E5\n0003  56\n0004  57\n0005  8B 75 06\n0008  8B 7D 04\n000B  FC\n\n000C  AC\n000D  3C 41\n000F  7C 06\n0011  3C 5A\n0013  7F 02\n0015  04 20\n0017  AA\n0018  08 C0\n001A  75 F0\n\n001C  5F\n001D  5E\n001E  5D\n001F  C3\n001F \n</pre>\n|\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"nasm\">\n; _strtolower:\n; Copy a null-terminated ASCII string, converting\n; all alphabetic characters to lower case.\n; ES=DS\n; Entry stack parameters\n;      [SP+4] = src, Address of source string\n;      [SP+2] = dst, Address of target string\n;      [SP+0] = Return address\n;\n_strtolower proc\n            push    bp             ;Set up the call frame\n            mov     bp,sp\n            push    si\n            push    di\n            mov     si,[bp+6]       ;Set SI = src (+2 due to push bp)\n            mov     di,[bp+4]       ;Set DI = dst\n            cld                     ;string direction ascending\n            \nloop:       lodsb                   ;Load AL from [si], inc si\n            cmp     al,'A'          ;If AL < 'A',\n            jl      copy            ; Skip conversion\n            cmp     al,'Z'          ;If AL > 'Z',\n            jg      copy            ; Skip conversion\n            add     al,'a'-'A'      ;Convert AL to lowercase\ncopy:       stosb                   ;Store AL to [di], inc di\n            or      al,al           ;If AL <> 0,\n            jne     loop            ; Repeat the loop\n            \ndone:       pop     di              ; restore di and si\n            pop     si\n            pop     bp              ;Restore the prev call frame\n            ret                     ;Return to caller\n            end     proc\n</syntaxhighlight>\n|}\n\nThe example code uses the BP (base pointer) register to establish a [[call frame]], an area on the stack that contains all of the parameters and local variables for the execution of the subroutine. This kind of [[calling convention]] supports [[reentrancy (computing)|reentrant]] and [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]] code and has been used by Algol-like languages since the late 1950s. A flat memory model is assumed, specifically, that the DS and ES segments address the same region of memory.\n\n===Performance===\n[[File:Intel 8086 block scheme.svg|thumb|405px|''Simplified block diagram over Intel 8088 (a variant of 8086); 1=main & index registers; 2=segment registers and IP; 3=address adder; 4=internal address bus; 5=instruction queue; 6=control unit (very simplified!); 7=bus interface; 8=internal databus; 9=ALU; 10/11/12=external address/data/control bus.'']]\n\nAlthough partly shadowed by other design choices in this particular chip, the [[multiplexed]] address and [[Bus (computing)|data buses]] limit performance slightly; transfers of 16-bit or 8-bit quantities are done in a four-clock memory access cycle, which is faster on 16-bit, although slower on 8-bit quantities, compared to many contemporary 8-bit based CPUs. As instructions vary from one to six bytes, fetch and execution are made [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] and decoupled into separate units (as it remains in today's x86 processors): The ''bus interface unit'' feeds the instruction stream to the ''execution unit'' through a 6-byte prefetch queue (a form of loosely coupled [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelining]]), speeding up operations on [[Processor register|register]]s and [[Operand|immediate]]s, while memory operations became slower (four years later, this performance problem was fixed with the [[80186]] and [[80286]]). However, the full (instead of partial) 16-bit architecture with a full width [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] meant that 16-bit arithmetic instructions could now be performed with a single ALU cycle (instead of two, via internal carry, as in the 8080 and 8085), speeding up such instructions considerably. Combined with [[orthogonalization]]s of operations versus [[operand]] types and [[addressing mode]]s, as well as other enhancements, this made the performance gain over the 8080 or 8085 fairly significant, despite cases where the older chips may be faster (see below).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100px; height: 50px;\"\n|+ Execution times for typical instructions (in clock cycles)<ref>{{cite book|title=Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.0 Reference Manual|year=1987|publisher=Microsoft Corporation| quote=Timings and encodings in this manual are used with permission of Intel and come from the following publications: Intel Corporation. iAPX 86, 88, 186 and 188 User's Manual, Programmer's Reference, Santa Clara, Calif. 1986.|title-link=MASM}} (Similarly for iAPX 286, 80386, 80387.)</ref>\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:bottom; border-bottom:3px double #999;\"\n!align=left | instruction\n!align=left | register-register\n!align=left | register immediate\n!align=left | register-memory\n!align=left | memory-register\n!align=left | memory-immediate\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|mov || 2 || 4|| 8+EA || 9+EA || 10+EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|ALU || 3 ||4|| 9+EA, || 16+EA,|| 17+EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|jump || colspan=\"5\" | ''register'' ≥ 11 ; ''label'' ≥ 15 ; ''condition,label'' ≥ 16\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|integer multiply || colspan=\"5\" | 70~160 (depending on operand ''data'' as well as size) ''including'' any EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|integer divide || colspan=\"5\" | 80~190 (depending on operand ''data'' as well as size) ''including'' any EA\n|}\n* EA = time to compute effective address, ranging from 5 to 12 cycles.\n* Timings are best case, depending on prefetch status, instruction alignment, and other factors.\n\nAs can be seen from these tables, operations on registers and immediates were fast (between 2 and 4 cycles), while memory-operand instructions and jumps were quite slow; jumps took more cycles than on the simple [[Intel 8080|8080]] and [[Intel 8085|8085]], and the 8088 (used in the IBM PC) was additionally hampered by its narrower bus. The reasons why most memory related instructions were slow were threefold:\n* Loosely coupled fetch and execution units are efficient for instruction prefetch, but not for jumps and random data access (without special measures).\n* No dedicated address calculation adder was afforded; the microcode routines had to use the main ALU for this (although there was a dedicated ''segment'' + ''offset'' adder).\n* The address and data buses were [[multiplexing|multiplex]]ed, forcing a slightly longer (33~50%) bus cycle than in typical contemporary 8-bit processors.{{Dubious|1=Multiplexed bus|reason=The multiplexed bus is unlikely to slow things by \"33~50%.\" The address was only delayed by the 18 nanosecond max propagation delay of the 74LS373 transparent latch.|date=May 2023}}\n\nHowever, memory access performance was drastically enhanced with Intel's next generation of 8086 family CPUs. The [[Intel 80186|80186]] and [[Intel 80286|80286]] both had dedicated address calculation hardware, saving many cycles, and the 80286 also had separate (non-multiplexed) address and data buses.\n\n===Floating point===\nThe 8086/8088 could be connected to a mathematical coprocessor to add hardware/microcode-based [[floating-point]] performance. The [[Intel 8087]] was the standard math coprocessor for the 8086 and 8088, operating on 80-bit numbers. Manufacturers like [[Cyrix]] (8087-compatible) and [[Weitek]] (''not'' 8087-compatible) eventually came up with high-performance floating-point coprocessors that competed with the 8087.\n\n==Chip versions==\nThe clock frequency was originally limited to 5&nbsp;MHz,<ref group=\"note\" >(IBM PC used 4.77&nbsp;MHz, 4/3 the standard NTSC [[color burst]] frequency)</ref> but the last versions in [[HMOS]] were specified for 10&nbsp;MHz. HMOS-III and [[CMOS]] versions were manufactured for a long time (at least a while into the 1990s) for [[embedded system]]s, although its successor, the [[Intel 80186|80186]]/[[Intel 80188|80188]] (which includes some on-chip peripherals), has been more popular for embedded use.\n\nThe 80C86, the CMOS version of the 8086, was used in the [[GRiDPad]], [[Toshiba T1200]], [[HP 110]], and finally the 1998–1999 [[Lunar Prospector]].\n\nFor the packaging, the Intel 8086 was available both in ceramic and plastic DIP packages.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Intel D8086 CS.jpg|A ceramic D8086 variant\nFile:Intel P8086.jpg|A plastic P8086 variant\n</gallery>\n\n===List of Intel 8086===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, the [[NEC V20]] and [[NEC V30]] pair were hardware-compatible with the 8088 and 8086 even though NEC made original Intel clones μPD8088D and μPD8086D respectively, but incorporated the instruction set of the 80186 along with some (but not all) of the 80186 speed enhancements, providing a drop-in capability to upgrade both instruction set and processing speed without manufacturers having to modify their designs. Such relatively simple and low-power 8086-compatible processors in CMOS are still used in embedded systems.\n\nThe electronics industry of the [[Soviet Union]] was able to replicate the 8086 through {{citation needed-span|both [[industrial espionage]] and reverse engineering|date=October 2013}}. The resulting chip, [[K1810VM86]], was binary and pin-compatible with the 8086.\n\ni8086 and i8088 were respectively the cores of the Soviet-made PC-compatible [[EC1831]] and [[EC1832]] desktops. (EC1831 is the EC identification of IZOT 1036C and EC1832 is the EC identification of IZOT 1037C, developed and manufactured in Bulgaria. EC stands for Единая Система.) However, the EC1831 computer (IZOT 1036C) had significant hardware differences from the IBM PC prototype. The EC1831 was the first PC-compatible computer with dynamic bus sizing (US Pat. No 4,831,514). Later some of the EC1831 principles were adopted in PS/2 (US Pat.

The 16-bit registers and the one [[megabyte]] address range are unchanged, however. In fact, according to the Intel documentation, the 8086 and 8088 have the same [[execution unit]] (EU)&mdash;only the [[Bus (computing)|bus interface unit]] (BIU) is different. The 8088 was used in the original [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] and in [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC compatible clones]].\n\n==History and description==\n[[File:AMD_8088_die.JPG|thumb|[[Die (integrated circuit)|Die]] of AMD 8088]]\nThe 8088 was designed at Intel's laboratory in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], as were a large number of Intel's processors.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Israel Test |publisher=[[Encounter Books]] |date=October 10, 2013 |first=George F. |last=Gilder |author-link=George Gilder |page=100 |isbn=978-1594036125}}</ref>  The 8088 was targeted at economical systems by allowing the use of an eight-bit data path and eight-bit support and peripheral chips; complex circuit boards were still fairly cumbersome and expensive when it was released. The [[prefetch input queue|prefetch]] queue of the 8088 was shortened to four bytes, from the 8086's six bytes, and the prefetch algorithm was slightly modified to adapt to the narrower bus.{{efn|Specifically, the most obvious change is that the 8088 bus unit will prefetch a byte when it can if at least one byte of the queue is empty; the 8086 bus unit will not prefetch unless at least two of the six queue bytes are empty, so that it can prefetch a whole aligned 16-bit word, which it does in one bus cycle.  The 8088, having an 8-bit external data bus, can only fetch one byte per bus cycle, so waiting to prefetch a whole word would have no benefit and would only delay, reducing the chance that the next instruction byte is already in the prefetch queue when it is needed.}} These modifications of the basic 8086 design were one of the first jobs assigned to Intel's new design office and laboratory in Haifa.\n\nVariants of the 8088 with more than 5&nbsp;MHz maximal clock frequency include the 8088–2, which was [[Semiconductor fabrication|fabricated]] using Intel's new enhanced [[NMOS logic|nMOS]] process called [[HMOS]] and specified for a maximal frequency of 8&nbsp;MHz. Later followed the 80C88, a [[static core|fully static]] [[CHMOS]] design, which could operate with clock speeds from 0 to 8&nbsp;MHz. There were also several other, more or less similar, variants from other manufacturers. For instance, the [[NEC V20]] was a [[pin-compatible]] and slightly faster (at the same clock frequency) variant of the 8088, designed and manufactured by [[NEC]]. Successive NEC 8088 compatible processors would run at up to 16&nbsp;MHz. In 1984, [[Commodore International]] signed a deal to manufacture the 8088 for use in a licensed [[Hyperion (computer)|Dynalogic Hyperion]] clone, in a move that was regarded as signaling a major new direction for the company.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h9RnfyXzV6sC&pg=PA52|title=Commodore Adds Hyperion, Chips|first=Karen|last=Cook|magazine=[[PC Magazine]]|volume=1|issue=8|page=52|date=April 17 – May 1, 1984}}</ref>  The available CMOS version was outsourced to [[Oki_Electric_Industry|Oki Electronic Industry Co., Ltd.]]<ref>Intel Corporation, \"NewsBit: Intel Licenses Oki on CMOS Version of Several Products\", Solutions, July/August 1984, Page 1.</ref>  When announced, the list price of the 8088 was US$124.80.<ref name=CW79>{{cite magazine |title=Intel Brings Out 8-Bit MPU featuring 16-Bit Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouiYCe_Xw20C&q=Intel+8088++architecture&pg=PA71 |magazine=[[Computerworld]] |date=May 14, 1979 |page=71 |access-date=November 21, 2011 |volume=XIII |issue=20 }}</ref><ref>Intel Corporation, \"Microcomputer Components: Intel Introduces the 8089 IOP, an I/O processor for the advanced 8088/8086 CPU family, the first of a series of new subsystem components\", Intel Preview, May/June 1979, Pg 9.</ref>  The plastic package version was introduced on July 1981 for USD $14.10 per 100 in quantities.<ref>Intel Corporation, \"News Bits\", Solutions, July/August 1981, Page 1</ref>  Intel second sourced this microprocessor to [[Fujitsu|Fujitsu Limited]].<ref>Intel Corporation, \"NewsBits: Second Source News\", Solutions, January/February 1985, Page 1</ref>\n\n===Differences from the 8086===\nThe 8088 is architecturally very similar to the 8086.  The main difference is that there are only eight data lines instead of the 8086's 16 lines.  All of the other pins of the device perform the same function as they do with the 8086 with two exceptions.  First, pin 34 is no longer {{overline|BHE}} (this is the high-order byte select on the 8086—the 8088 does not have a high-order byte on its eight-bit data bus).<ref name=\"Osborne\">Osborne 16 bit Processor Handbook (Adam Osborne & Gerry Kane) {{ISBN|0-931988-43-8}}.</ref>{{rp|5–97}}  Instead it outputs a maximum mode status, {{overline|SS0}}.  Combined with the IO/{{overline|M}} and DT/{{overline|R}} signals, the bus cycles can be decoded (it generally indicates when a write operation or an interrupt is in progress).  The second change is the pin that signals whether a memory access or input/output access is being made has had it sense reversed.  The pin on the 8088 is IO/{{overline|M}}.  On the 8086 part it is {{overline|IO}}/M.  The reason for the reversal is that it makes the 8088 compatible with the [[Intel 8085|8085]].<ref name=\"Osborne\"/>{{rp|5–98}}\n\n===Performance===\nDepending on the [[clock frequency]], the number of memory [[wait state]]s, as well as on the characteristics of the particular application program, the ''average'' performance for the Intel 8088 ranged approximately from 0.33 to 1&nbsp;million [[instructions per second]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympusmicro.com/micd/galleries/chips/intel8088a.html|title=Olympus MIC-D: Integrated Circuit Gallery - Intel 8088 Microprocessor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519154800/http://www.olympusmicro.com/micd/galleries/chips/intel8088a.html|archive-date=May 19, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Meanwhile, the <code>mov ''reg,reg''</code> and <code>[[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]{{efn|ALU stands for one of the instructions ADD, ADC, SUB, SBC, CMP, AND, OR, XOR, TEST.}} ''reg,reg''</code> instructions, taking two and three cycles respectively, yielded an ''absolute peak'' performance of between {{frac|1|3}} and {{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;MIPS per MHz, that is, somewhere in the range 3–5&nbsp;MIPS at 10&nbsp;MHz.\n\nThe speed of the execution unit (EU) and the bus of the 8086 CPU was well balanced; with a typical instruction mix, an 8086 could execute instructions out of the prefetch queue a good bit of the time.  Cutting down the bus to eight bits made it a serious bottleneck in the 8088.  With the speed of instruction fetch reduced by 50% in the 8088 as compared to the 8086, a sequence of fast instructions can quickly drain the four-byte prefetch queue.  When the queue is empty, instructions take as long to complete as they take to fetch.  Both the 8086 and 8088 take four clock cycles to complete a bus cycle; whereas for the 8086 this means four clocks to transfer two bytes, on the 8088 it is four clocks per byte.  Therefore, for example, a two-byte shift or rotate instruction, which takes the EU only two clock cycles to execute, actually takes eight clock cycles to complete if it is not in the prefetch queue.  A sequence of such fast instructions prevents the queue from being filled as fast as it is drained, and \nin general, because so many basic instructions execute in fewer than four clocks per instruction byte&mdash;including almost all the ALU and data-movement instructions on register operands and some of these on memory operands&mdash;it is practically impossible to avoid idling the EU in the 8088 at least {{frac|1|4}} of the time while executing useful real-world programs, and it is not hard to idle it half the time.  In short, an 8088 typically runs about half as fast as 8086 clocked at the same rate, because of the bus bottleneck (the only major difference).\n\nA side effect of the 8088 design, with the slow bus and the small prefetch queue, is that the speed of code execution can be very dependent on instruction order.  When programming the 8088, for CPU efficiency, it is vital to interleave long-running instructions with short ones whenever possible.  For example, a repeated string operation or a shift by three or more will take long enough to allow time for the 4-byte prefetch queue to completely fill.  If short instructions (i.e. ones totaling few bytes) are placed between slower instructions like these, the short ones can execute at full speed out of the queue.  If, on the other hand, the slow instructions are executed sequentially, back to back, then after the first of them the bus unit will be forced to idle because the queue will already be full, with the consequence that later more of the faster instructions will suffer fetch delays that might have been avoidable.  As some instructions, such as single-bit-position shifts and rotates, take literally 4 times as long to fetch as to execute,{{efn|On the 8088, a shift instruction with an implied shift count of 1, which can execute in two clock cycles, is two bytes long and so takes eight clock cycles to fetch.}} the overall effect can be a slowdown by a factor of two or more.  If those code segments are the bodies of loops, the difference in execution time may be very noticeable on the human timescale.\n\nThe 8088 is also (like the 8086) slow at accessing memory.  The same ALU that is used to execute arithmetic and logic instructions is also used to calculate effective addresses.  There is a separate adder for adding a shifted segment register to the offset address, but the offset EA itself is always calculated entirely in the main ALU.  Furthermore, the loose coupling of the EU and BIU (bus unit) inserts communication overhead between the units, and the four-clock period bus transfer cycle is not particularly streamlined.  Contrast this with the two-clock period bus cycle of the 6502 CPU and the 80286's three-clock period bus cycle with pipelining down to two cycles for most transfers.  Most 8088 instructions that can operate on either registers or memory, including common ALU and data-movement operations, are at least four times slower for memory operands than for only register operands.  Therefore, efficient 8088 (and 8086) programs avoid repeated access of memory operands when possible, loading operands from memory into registers to work with them there and storing back only the finished results.  The relatively large general register set of the 8088 compared to its contemporaries assists this strategy.  When there are not enough registers for all variables that are needed at once, saving registers by pushing them onto the stack and popping them back to restore them is the fastest way to use memory to augment the registers, as the stack PUSH and POP instructions are the fastest memory operations.  The same is probably not true on the 80286 and later; they have dedicated address ALUs and perform memory accesses much faster than the 8088 and 8086.\n\nFinally, because calls, jumps, and interrupts reset the prefetch queue, and because loading the IP register requires communication between the EU and the BIU (since the IP register is in the BIU, not in the EU, where the general registers are), these operations are costly.  All jumps and calls take at least 15 clock cycles.  Any conditional jump requires four clock cycles if not taken, but if taken, it requires 16 cycles in addition to resetting the prefetch queue; therefore, conditional jumps should be arranged to be not taken most of the time, especially inside loops.  In some cases, a sequence of logic and movement operations is faster than a conditional jump that skips over one or two instructions to achieve the same result.\n\nIntel datasheets for the 8086 and 8088 advertised the dedicated multiply and divide instructions (MUL, IMUL, DIV, and IDIV), but they are very slow, on the order of 100–200 clock cycles each.  Many simple multiplications by small constants (besides powers of 2, for which shifts can be used) can be done much faster using dedicated short subroutines.  The 80286 and 80386 each greatly increase the execution speed of these multiply and divide instructions.{{efn|Most of the technical information in this section is sourced from the Intel iAPX 86,88 User's Manual, August 1981 (Order Number: 210201-001) by Intel Corporation.}}\n\n===Selection for use in the IBM PC===\n[[File:Ibm_pc_5150.jpg|thumb|right|[[IBM Personal Computer]] ]]\nThe original [[IBM PC]] is the most influential microcomputer to use the 8088. It has a [[clock frequency]] of 4.77&nbsp;MHz (4/3 the [[NTSC]] [[colorburst]] frequency). Some of IBM's engineers and other employees wanted to use the [[IBM 801]] processor, some preferred the new [[Motorola 68000]],{{efn|Later used for the IBM Instruments [[IBM System 9000|Laboratory Computer]].}} and others argued for a small and simple microprocessor, such as the [[MOS Technology 6502]] or [[Zilog Z80]], which are in earlier personal computers. However, IBM already had a history of using Intel chips in its products and had also acquired the rights to manufacture the [[Intel 8086|8086]] family.{{efn|In exchange for giving Intel the rights to its [[bubble memory]] designs. However, due to fierce competition from Japanese manufacturers, who were able to undercut by cost, Intel soon left this market and changed focus to microprocessors.}}\n\nIBM chose the 8088 over the 8086 because Intel offered a better price for the former and could supply more units.<ref name=\"freiberger19820823\">{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 | title=Bill Gates, Microsoft and the IBM Personal Computer | magazine=[[InfoWorld]] | date=August 23, 1982 | access-date=January 29, 2015 | last=Freiberger |first=Paul | pages=22 |volume=4 |issue=33 }}</ref> Another factor was that the 8088 allowed the computer to be based on a modified [[Intel 8085|8085]] design, as it could easily interface with most nMOS chips with 8-bit databuses. These were mature, and therefore economical, components.

The file system is an [[international standard]] available from the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). Since the specification is available for anybody to purchase,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:9660:ed-1:v1:en|title=ISO 9660:1988(en), Information processing – Volume and file structure of CD-ROM for information interchange|date=1988|website=ISO (International Organization for Standardization)|publisher=ISO|access-date=2017-12-17}}</ref> implementations have been written for many [[operating system]]s.\n\nISO 9660 traces its roots to the ''High Sierra Format'',<ref>{{cite journal|title=Working Paper for Information Processing: Volume and File Structure of CD-ROM for Information Interchange|journal=Optical Information Systems|date=January 1987|volume=7|issue=1|pages=29–49}}</ref> which arranged file information in a dense, sequential layout to minimize nonsequential access by using a hierarchical (eight levels of directories deep) tree file system arrangement, similar to UNIX and [[File Allocation Table|FAT]]. To facilitate cross platform compatibility, it defined a minimal set of common file attributes (directory or ordinary file and time of recording) and name attributes (name, extension, and version), and used a separate system use area where future optional extensions for each file may be specified. High Sierra was adopted in December 1986 (with changes) as an international standard by [[Ecma International]] as ECMA-119<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-119.htm| title = Volume and File Structure of CDROM for Information Interchange | publisher = Ecma International| date = December 1987 }}</ref> and submitted for fast tracking to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], where it was eventually accepted as ISO 9660:1988.<ref name=\"ISO9660\">{{ cite book | title = Volume and File Structure of CD-ROM for Information Interchange | date = 1988-09-01 | publisher = International Organization for Standardization (ISO) | location = Geneva | edition = corrected }}</ref> Subsequent amendments to the standard were published [[#History|in 2013 and 2020]].\n\nThe first 16 sectors of the file system are empty and reserved for other uses. The rest begins with a ''volume descriptor set'' (a header block which describes the subsequent layout) and then the path tables, directories and files on the disc. An ISO 9660 compliant disc must contain at least one ''primary volume descriptor'' describing the file system and a ''volume descriptor set terminator'' which is a volume descriptor that marks the end of the descriptor set. The primary volume descriptor provides information about the volume, characteristics and metadata, including a root directory record that indicates in which sector the root directory is located. Other fields contain metadata such as the volume's name and creator, along with the size and number of logical blocks used by the file system. Path tables summarize the directory structure of the relevant directory hierarchy. For each directory in the image, the path table provides the directory identifier, the location of the extent in which the directory is recorded, the length of any extended attributes associated with the directory, and the index of its parent directory path table entry.\n\nThere are several extensions to ISO 9660 that relax some of its limitations. Notable examples include ''Rock Ridge'' (Unix-style permissions and longer names), ''Joliet'' ([[Unicode]], allowing non-[[Latin script]]s to be used), ''El Torito'' (enables CDs to be [[booting|bootable]]) and the ''Apple ISO 9660 Extensions'' (file characteristics specific to the [[classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]], such as [[resource fork]]s, file backup date and more).\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Compact disc]]s were originally developed for recording musical data, but soon were used for storing additional digital data types because they were equally effective for archival [[mass storage|mass data storage]]. Called [[CD-ROM]]s, the lowest level format for these type of compact discs was defined in the ''[[Rainbow Books|Yellow Book]]'' specification in 1983. However, this book did not define any format for organizing data on CD-ROMs into logical units such as [[computer file|files]], which led to every CD-ROM maker creating its own format. In order to develop a CD-ROM [[file system]] standard (''Z39.60'' - ''Volume and File Structure of CDROM for Information Interchange''), the [[National Information Standards Organization]] (NISO) set up Standards Committee SC EE (Compact Disc Data Format) in July 1985.<ref name=\"Peters_1989\" /> In September/<ref>{{cite journal |title=Premium Reference Tool of the '90s |journal=[[PC Magazine]] |date=1986-10-14 |pages=150–164 |author-first1=John |author-last1=Helliwell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nuXmVNll5JEC&pg=PA154 |access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> October 1985 several companies invited experts to participate in the development of a working paper for such a standard.\n\nIn November 1985, representatives of <!-- sources vary: 12-16 --> computer hardware manufacturers gathered at the High Sierra Hotel and Casino (currently called the [[Golden Nugget Lake Tahoe]]) in [[Stateline, Nevada]].<ref>{{cite book |author-last1=Manes |author-first1=Stephen |author1-link=Stephen Manes |author-last2=Andrews |author-first2=Paul |year=1993 |title=Gates: How Microsoft's Mogul Reinvented an Industry—and Made Himself the Richest Man in America |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |page=336 |isbn=0-385-42075-7}}</ref> This group became known as the ''High Sierra Group'' (''HSG'').

The ''High Sierra Group Proposal'' (''HSGP'') was released in May 1986, defining a file system for CD-ROMs commonly known as the High Sierra Format.\n\nA draft version of this proposal was submitted to the [[European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (ECMA) for standardization. With some changes, this led to the issue of the initial edition of the ECMA-119 standard in December 1986.<ref name=\"ECMA-119-1\">{{cite web |title=Standard ECMA-119: Volume and File Structure of CDROM for Information Interchange |edition=1st |date=December 1986 |url=https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-119_1st_edition_december_1986.pdf}}</ref> The ECMA submitted their standard to the [[International Standards Organization]] (ISO) for ''fast tracking'', where it was further refined into the ISO 9660 standard.

These collectively act as a [[header (computing)|header]] for the data area, describing its content (similar to the [[BIOS parameter block]] used by [[File Allocation Table|FAT]], [[High Performance File System|HPFS]] and [[NTFS]] formatted disks).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Volume descriptor set\n|-\n| Volume descriptor #1\n|-\n| ...\n|-\n| Volume descriptor #N\n|-\n| Volume descriptor set terminator\n|}\n\nEach volume descriptor is 2048 bytes in size, fitting perfectly into a single Mode 1 or Mode 2 Form 1 sector. They have the following structure:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Volume descriptor (2,048 bytes)\n|-\n! Part\n| Type\n| Identifier\n| Version\n| Data\n|-\n! Size\n| 1 byte\n| 5 bytes (always 'CD001')\n| 1 byte (always 0x01)\n| 2,041 bytes\n|}\n\nThe data field of a volume descriptor may be subdivided into several fields, with the exact content depending on the type. Redundant copies of each volume descriptor can also be included in case the first copy of the descriptor becomes corrupt.\n\nStandard volume descriptor types are the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Basic volume descriptor types\n|-\n! Value\n! Type\n|-\n| 0\n| Boot record volume descriptor\n|-\n| 1\n| Primary volume descriptor\n|-\n| 2\n| Supplementary volume descriptor, or enhanced volume descriptor\n|-\n| 3\n| Volume partition descriptor\n|-\n| 255\n| Volume descriptor set terminator\n|}\n\nAn ISO 9660 compliant disc must contain at least one ''primary volume descriptor'' describing the file system and a ''volume descriptor set terminator'' for indicating the end of the descriptor sequence. The ''volume descriptor set terminator'' is simply a particular type of volume descriptor with the purpose of marking the end of this set of structures. The primary volume descriptor provides information about the volume, characteristics and metadata, including a root directory record that indicates in which sector the root directory is located. Other fields contain the description or name of the volume, and information about who created it and with which application. The size of the logical blocks which the file system uses to segment the volume is also stored in a field inside the primary volume descriptor, as well as the amount of space occupied by the volume (measured in number of logical blocks).\n\nIn addition to the primary volume descriptor(s), ''supplementary volume descriptors'' or ''enhanced volume descriptors'' may be present.\n* Supplementary volume descriptors describe the same volume as the primary volume descriptor does, and are normally used for providing additional code page support when the standard code tables are insufficient. The standard specifies that [[ISO 2022]] is used for managing code sets that are wider than 8 bytes, and that [[ISO 2375]] escape sequences are used to identify each particular code page used. Consequently, ISO 9660 supports international single-byte and multi-byte character sets, provided they fit into the framework of the referenced standards. However, ISO 9660 does not specify any code pages that are guaranteed to be supported: all use of code tables other than those defined in the standard itself are subject to agreement between the originator and the recipient of the volume.\n* Enhanced volume descriptors were introduced in ISO 9660, Amendment 1.  They relax some of the requirements of the other volume descriptors and the directory records referenced by them: for example, the directory depth can exceed eight, file identifiers need not contain '.' or file version number, the length of a file and directory identifier is maximized to 207.\n\n=== Path tables ===\n\nPath tables summarize the directory structure of the relevant directory hierarchy. For each directory in the image, the path table provides the directory identifier, the location of the extent in which the directory is recorded, the length of any extended attributes associated with the directory, and the index of its parent directory path table entry. The parent directory number is a 16-bit number, limiting its range from 1 to 65,535.<ref>ISO9660 sections 6.9 and 9.4.4</ref>\n\n=== Directories and files ===\n[[File:Iso9660directoryTree.png|thumb|Overview of the ISO 9660 directory structure]]\n\nDirectory entries are stored following the location of the root directory entry, where evaluation of filenames is begun. Both directories and files are stored as [[Extent (file systems)|extents]], which are sequential series of sectors. Files and directories are differentiated only by a file attribute that indicates its nature (similar to [[Unix]]). The attributes of a file are stored in the directory entry that describes the file, and optionally in the extended attribute record. To locate a file, the directory names in the file's path can be checked sequentially, going to the location of each directory to obtain the location of the subsequent subdirectory. However, a file can also be located through the path table provided by the file system. This path table stores information about each directory, its parent, and its location on disc. Since the path table is stored in a contiguous region, it can be searched much faster than jumping to the particular locations of each directory in the file's path, thus reducing seek time.\n\nThe standard specifies three nested levels of interchange (paraphrased from section 10):\n\n* Level 1: File names are limited to eight characters with a three-character extension. Directory names are limited to eight characters. Files may contain one single file section.\n* Level 2: Files may contain one single file section.\n* Level 3: No additional restrictions than those stipulated in the main body of the standard. That is, directory identifiers may not exceed 31 characters in length, and file name + '.' + file name extension may not exceed 30 characters in length (sections 7.5 and 7.6). Files are also allowed to consist of multiple non-contiguous sections (with some restrictions as to order).\n\nAdditional restrictions in the body of the standard: The depth of the directory hierarchy must not exceed 8 (root directory being at level 1), and the path length of any file must not exceed 255. (section 6.8.2.1).\n\nThe standard also specifies the following name restrictions (sections 7.5 and 7.6):<ref name=\"ISO9660\" />\n\n* All levels restrict file names in the mandatory file hierarchy to upper case letters, digits, underscores (\"_\"), and a dot. (See also section 7.4.4 and Annex A.)\n* If no characters are specified for the File Name then the File Name Extension shall consist of at least one character.\n* If no characters are specified for the File Name Extension then the File Name shall consist of at least one character.\n* File names shall not have more than one dot.\n* Directory names shall not use dots at all.\n\nA CD-ROM producer may choose one of the lower Levels of Interchange specified in chapter 10 of the standard, and further restrict file name length from 30 characters to only 8+3 in file identifiers, and 8 in directory identifiers in order to promote interchangeability with implementations that do not implement the full standard.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}\n\nAll numbers in ISO 9660 file systems except the single byte value used for the GMT offset are unsigned numbers. As the length of a file's [[extent (file systems)|extent]] on disc is stored in a 32 bit value,<ref>ISO 9660 section 9.1.4</ref> it allows for a maximum length of just over 4.2&nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] (more precisely, one byte less than 4&nbsp;[[GiB]]). It is possible to circumvent this limitation by using the multi-extent (fragmentation) feature of ISO 9660 Level 3 to create ISO 9660 file systems and single files up to 8&nbsp;TB. With this, files larger than 4&nbsp;GiB can be split up into multiple extents (sequential series of sectors), each not exceeding the 4 GiB limit. For example, the free software such as [[InfraRecorder]], [[ImgBurn]] and [[mkisofs]] as well as [[Roxio Toast]] are able to create ISO 9660 file systems that use multi-extent files to store files larger than 4 GiB on appropriate media such as recordable DVDs.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} [[Linux]] supports multiple extents.<ref>{{cite mailing list | url = http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-bugs/2006-April/017786.html| title = kern/95222: File sections on ISO9660 level 3 CDs ignored | author = Pete | mailing-list = freebsd-bugs | date = 2 April 2006}}</ref>\n\nSince amendment 1 (or ECMA-119 3rd edition, or \"JIS X 0606:1998 / ISO 9660:1999\"), a much wider variety of file trees can be expressed by the EVD system. There is no longer any character limit (even 8-bit characters are allowed), nor any depth limit or path length limit. There still is a limit on name length, at 207. The character set is no longer enforced, so both sides of the disc interchange need to agree via a different channel.<ref name=ecma119.3/>\n\n== Extensions and improvements ==\n\nThere are several extensions to ISO 9660 that relax some of its limitations. Notable examples include ''Rock Ridge'' (Unix-style permissions and longer names), ''Joliet'' ([[Unicode]], allowing non-[[Latin script]]s to be used), ''El Torito'' (enables CDs to be [[booting|bootable]]) and the ''Apple ISO 9660 Extensions'' (file characteristics specific to the [[classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]], such as [[resource fork]]s, file backup date and more).\n\n=== SUSP ===\n\n''System Use Sharing Protocol'' (SUSP, [[IEEE]] P1281) provides a generic way of including additional properties for any directory entry reachable from the primary volume descriptor (PVD). In an ISO 9660 volume, every directory entry has an optional ''system use area'' whose contents are undefined and left to be interpreted by the system.  SUSP defines a method to subdivide that area into multiple system use fields, each identified by a two-character signature tag.  The idea behind SUSP was that it would enable any number of independent extensions to ISO 9660 to be created and included on a volume without conflicting. It also allows for the inclusion of property data that would otherwise be too large to fit within the limits of the system use area.\n\nSUSP defines several common tags and system use fields:\n\n* <code>CE</code>: Continuation area\n* <code>PD</code>: Padding field\n* <code>SP</code>: System use sharing protocol indicator\n* <code>ST</code>: System use sharing protocol terminator\n* <code>ER</code>: Extensions reference\n* <code>ES</code>: Extension selector\n\nOther known SUSP fields include:\n\n* <code>AA</code>: Apple extension, preferred\n* <code>BA</code>: Apple extension, old (length attribute is missing)\n* <code>AS</code>: Amiga file properties\n* <code>ZF</code>: zisofs compressed file, usually produced by program mkzftree or by libisofs. Transparently decompressed by Linux kernel if built with CONFIG_ZISOFS.<ref>{{cite web|title=linux/fs/isofs/Kconfig|website= [[GitHub]]|date= 23 January 2022|url= https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/isofs/Kconfig}}</ref>\n* <code>AL</code>: records [[Extended file attributes|Extended File Attributes]], including [[Access control list|ACLs]]. Proposed by [[libburnia]], supported by libisofs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arbitrary Attribute Interchange Protocol|url=https://dev.lovelyhq.com/libburnia/web/wiki/AAIP}}</ref>\n\nThe Apple extensions do not technically follow the SUSP standard; however the basic structure of the AA and AB fields defined by Apple are [[Forward compatibility|forward compatible]] with SUSP; so that, with care, a volume can use both Apple extensions as well as RRIP extensions.\n\n=== Rock Ridge ===\n\nThe ''Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol'' (RRIP, [[IEEE]] P1282) is an extension which adds [[POSIX]] [[file system]] semantics.  The availability of these extension properties allows for better integration with [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] operating systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ymi.com/ymi/sites/default/files/pdf/Rockridge.pdf|title=RRIP (IEEE P1282) Draft Standard 1.12|date=8 July 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043745/http://www.ymi.com/ymi/sites/default/files/pdf/Rockridge.pdf|archive-date=2017-04-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> The standard takes its name from the fictional town ''Rock Ridge'' in [[Mel Brooks]]' film ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=CDFS The Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol (RRIP, IEEE P1282)|url=http://www.cdfs.com/cdfs-glos-rrip.html}}</ref> The RRIP extensions are, briefly:\n\n* Longer file names (up to 255 bytes) and fewer restrictions on allowed characters (support for lowercase, etc.)\n* UNIX-style [[Unix permissions#Traditional Unix permissions|file modes]], [[user id]]s and group ids, and file [[timestamp]]s\n* Support for [[Symbolic link]]s and [[Device file system|device files]]\n* Deeper directory hierarchy (more than 8 levels)\n* Efficient storage of [[sparse file]]s\n\nThe RRIP extensions are built upon SUSP, defining additional tags for support of POSIX semantics, along with the format and meaning of the corresponding system use fields:\n\n* <code>RR</code>: Rock Ridge extensions in-use indicator (note: dropped from standard after version 1.09)\n* <code>PX</code>: POSIX file attributes\n* <code>PN</code>: POSIX device numbers\n* <code>SL</code>: symbolic link\n* <code>NM</code>: alternate name\n* <code>CL</code>: child link\n* <code>PL</code>: parent link\n* <code>RE</code>: relocated directory\n* <code>TF</code>: time stamp\n* <code>SF</code>: sparse file data\n\n''Amiga Rock Ridge'' is similar to RRIP, except it provides additional properties used by [[AmigaOS]]. It too is built on the SUSP standard by defining an \"AS\"-tagged system use field.  Thus both Amiga Rock Ridge and the POSIX RRIP may be used simultaneously on the same volume. Some of the specific properties supported by this extension are the additional [[Amiga]]-bits for files. There is support for attribute \"P\" that stands for \"pure\" bit (indicating re-entrant command) and attribute \"S\" for script bit (indicating [[batch file]]). This includes the protection flags plus an optional comment field. These extensions were introduced by Angela Schmidt with the help of Andrew Young, the primary author of the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol and System Use Sharing Protocol. The first publicly available software to master a CD-ROM with Amiga extensions was [[MakeCD]], an Amiga software which Angela Schmidt developed together with Patrick Ohly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amiga MakeCD Support Page|url=http://www.estamos.de/makecd/|access-date=2017-04-04|language=de|author=Angela Schmidt, Patrick Ohly }}</ref>\n\n=== El Torito ===\n{{missing information|section|relationship to FAT filesystem, operation under UEFI|date=September 2023}}\n''El Torito'' is an extension designed to allow [[booting]] a computer from a CD-ROM.

According to legend, the El Torito CD/DVD extension to ISO 9660 got its name because its design originated in an [[El Torito]] restaurant in [[Irvine, California]] ({{CoordDec|33.684722|-117.852547}}).<ref name=\"Parker\">{{ cite news | last = Parker | first = Dana J. | title = Fresh Tortillas and CD-ROM Standards: The El Torito Bootable CD-ROM Specification | periodical = CD-ROM Professional | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | url = http://www.cdpage.com/Compact_Disc_Variations/danaboot.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19991008045553/http://www.cdpage.com/Compact_Disc_Variations/danaboot.html | access-date = 2008-01-31 | archive-date = 1999-10-08 }}</ref> The initial two authors were Curtis Stevens, of Phoenix Technologies, and Stan Merkin, of IBM.<ref name=\"Parker\" />\n\nA 32-bit PC BIOS will search for boot code on an ISO 9660 CD-ROM. The standard allows for booting in two different modes. Either in hard disk emulation when the boot information can be accessed directly from the CD media, or in floppy emulation mode where the boot information is stored in an [[disk image|image file]] of a [[floppy disk]], which is loaded from the CD and then behaves as a virtual floppy disk. This is useful for computers that were designed to boot only from a floppy drive. For modern computers the \"no emulation\" mode is generally the more reliable method. The BIOS will assign a BIOS drive number to the CD drive. The drive number (for [[INT 13H]]) assigned is any of 80<sub>hex</sub> ([[hard disk]] emulation), 00<sub>hex</sub> ([[floppy disk]] emulation) or an arbitrary number if the BIOS should not provide emulation. Emulation is useful for booting older [[operating system]]s from a CD, by making it appear to them as if they were booted from a hard or floppy disk.\n\nEl Torito can also be used to produce CDs which can boot up [[Linux]] operating systems, by including the [[GRUB]] bootloader on the CD and following the [[Multiboot Specification]].<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://wiki.osdev.org/El-Torito | title = El-Torito | work = OSDev | access-date = 2015-01-03 }}</ref> While the El Torito spec alludes to a \"Mac\" platform ID, PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh computers don't use it.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.macdisk.com/hybbooten.php | title = Bootable hybrid (ISO/HFS) CD-ROMs | access-date = 2014-01-03 }}</ref>\n\n=== Joliet ===\n\n''Joliet'' is an extension specified and endorsed by [[Microsoft]] and has been supported by all versions of its [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]] since [[Windows 95]]<ref name=\"mskb125630\">{{cite web | title = Joliet Specification for CD-ROM | id = MSKB 125630 | work = Microsoft Knowledge Base | publisher = Microsoft | date = 2005-07-11 | url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/125630 | access-date = 2012-05-29 }}</ref> and [[Windows NT 4.0]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Windows NT Support For Long File Names Under CDFS File System | id = MSKB 142372 | work = Microsoft Knowledge Base | publisher = Microsoft | date = 1 November 2006 | url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/142372 | access-date = 2012-05-29 }}</ref> Its primary focus is the relaxation of the filename restrictions inherent with full ISO 9660 compliance. Joliet accomplishes this by supplying an additional set of filenames that are encoded in [[UCS-2]]BE ([[UTF-16]]BE in practice since Windows 2000). These filenames are stored in a special supplementary volume descriptor, that is safely ignored by ISO 9660-compliant software, thus preserving backward compatibility.<ref name=\"mskb125630\"/> The specification only allows filenames to be up to 64 [[Unicode]] characters in length. However, the documentation for [[mkisofs]] states filenames up to 103 characters in length do not appear to cause problems.<ref name=mkisofs>{{man|8|mkisofs|FreeBSD}}</ref> Microsoft has documented it \"can use up to 110 characters.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = 5 Appendix A: Product Behavior | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff469400.aspx | access-date = 13 April 2014 }}</ref> The difference lies in whether CDXA extension space is used.<ref name=mkisofs/>\n\nJoliet allows Unicode characters to be used for all text fields, which includes file names and the volume name. A \"Secondary\" volume descriptor with type 2 contains the same information as the Primary one (sector 16 offset 40 bytes), but in [[UCS-2|UCS-2BE]] in sector 17, offset 40 bytes. As a result of this, the volume name is limited to 16 characters.\n\nMany current PC operating systems are able to read Joliet-formatted media, thus allowing exchange of files between those operating systems even if non-Roman characters are involved (such as Arabic, Japanese or Cyrillic), which was formerly not possible with plain ISO 9660-formatted media. Operating systems which can read Joliet media include:\n\n* [[Microsoft Windows]];<ref name=\"mskb125630\"/> Microsoft recommends the use of the Joliet extension for developers targeting Windows.<ref name=\"mskb125630\"/>\n* [[Linux]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Is Microsoft's Joliet filesystem supported? | work = The Linux CD-ROM HOWTO | version = Revision 1.17 | date = 18 July 2001 | author = Jeff Tranter | url = https://tldp.org/HOWTO/CDROM-HOWTO/x1186.html#AEN1328 | access-date = 2012-05-29 }}</ref>\n* [[macOS]]<ref>{{cite web | title = hdiutil(1) | work = BSD General Commands Manual | publisher = Apple | date = 18 March 2011 | version = Mac OS X Version 10.7.4 | url = https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/hdiutil.1.html | access-date = 2012-05-29 }}</ref>\n* [[FreeBSD]]<ref>{{cite web | title = FreeBSD 3.2 Release Notes | publisher = The FreeBSD Project | url = http://www.freebsd.org/releases/3.2R/notes.html | access-date = 29 May 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[OpenSolaris]]<ref>{{cite web | title = hsfs - High Sierra & ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system | work = OpenSolaris Man Page Set | date = 1 November 2006 | version = SunOS 5.11 / OpenSolaris 2009.06 | url = http://www.unix.com/man-page/OpenSolaris/7fs/hsfs/ | access-date = 2012-05-29 }}</ref>\n* [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Haiku Source Tree, src/add-ons/kernel/file_systems/iso9660/iso9660.cpp | url = http://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/tree/src/add-ons/kernel/file_systems/iso9660/iso9660.cpp }}</ref>\n* [[AmigaOS]]\n* [[RISC OS]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Add support for Joliet format CD-ROMs hdr/Hashes s/Directory s/EntryFile s/FileMan s/Filer s/Free (999bdda6) · Commits · RiscOS / Sources / FileSys / CDFS / CDFS | date = 15 August 2013| url = https://gitlab.riscosopen.org/RiscOS/Sources/FileSys/CDFS/CDFS/-/commit/999bdda6c38c3fa78ff7e58bd1752c1052f8c247}}</ref>\n\n=== Romeo ===\n\n''Romeo'' was developed by [[Adaptec]] and allows the use of long filenames up to 128 characters, written directly into the primary volume descriptor using the current [[code page]].

For example, \"ü\" may become \"³\". A different OS may encounter a similar problem or refuse to recognize these noncompliant names outright.\n\nThe same code page problem technically exists in standard ISO 9660, which allows open interpretation of the supplemental and enhanced volume descriptors to any character encoding subject to agreement. However, the primary volume descriptor is guaranteed to be a small subset of ASCII.\n\n=== Apple extensions ===\n\n[[Apple Computer]] authored a set of extensions that add [[ProDOS]] or [[Hierarchical File System (Apple)|HFS]]/[[HFS Plus|HFS+]] (the primary contemporary file systems for the [[classic Mac OS]]) properties to the filesystem. Some of the additional metadata properties include:<ref>{{cite web |url = http://developer.apple.com/technotes/fl/fl_36.html |title = Technical Note FL36: Apple Extensions to ISO 9660 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226015418/http://developer.apple.com/technotes/fl/fl_36.html |archive-date=26 December 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Date of last backup\n* File type\n* Creator code\n* Flags and data for display\n* Reference to a [[resource fork]]\n\nIn order to allow non-Macintosh systems to access Macintosh files on CD-ROMs, Apple chose to use an extension of the standard ISO 9660 format. Most of the data, other than the Apple specific metadata, remains visible to [[operating system]]s that are able to read ISO 9660.\n\n=== Other extensions ===\n\nFor operating systems which do not support any extensions, a name translation file <code>TRANS.TBL</code> must be used. The <code>TRANS.TBL</code> file is a plain [[ASCII]] text file. Each line contains three fields, separated by an arbitrary amount of [[Whitespace character|whitespace]]:\n\n* The file type (\"F\" for file or \"D\" for directory);\n* The ISO 9660 filename (including the usually hidden \";1\" for files); and\n* The extended filename, which may contain spaces.\nMost implementations that create TRANS.TBL files put a single space between the file type and ISO 9660 name and some arbitrary number of tabs between the ISO 9660 filename and the extended filename.\n\nNative support for using <code>TRANS.TBL</code> still exists in many ISO 9660 implementations, particularly those related to [[Unix]].  However, it has long since been superseded by other extensions, and modern utilities that create ISO 9660 images either cannot create TRANS.TBL files at all, or no longer create them unless explicitly requested by the user.  Since a TRANS.TBL file has no special identification other than its name, it can also be created separately and included in the directory before filesystem creation.\n\nThe [[ISO 13490]] standard is an extension to the ISO 9660 format that adds support for multiple [[Session (CD)|sessions]] on a disc. Since ISO 9660 is by design a read-only, pre-mastered file system, all the data has to be written in one go or \"session\" to the medium. Once written, there is no provision for altering the stored content. ISO 13490 was created to allow adding more files to a writeable disc such as [[CD-R]] in multiple sessions.\n\nThe ISO 13346/ECMA-167 standard was designed in conjunction to the ISO 13490 standard. This new format addresses most of the shortcomings of ISO 9660, and a subset of it evolved into the [[Universal Disk Format]] (UDF), which was adopted for [[DVD]]s. The volume descriptor table retains the ISO9660 layout, but the identifier has been updated.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-167.pdf| title = ECMA-167 - Volume and File Structure for Write-Once and Rewritable Media using Non-Sequential Recording for Information Interchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.standards.com/StandardsDownloads/birth.html| title = Birth Announcement: ISO/IEC 13346 and ISO/IEC 13490}}</ref>\n\n== Disc images ==\n\n[[Optical disc image]]s are a common way to electronically transfer the contents of CD-ROMs. They often have the [[filename extension]] <code>.iso</code> (<code>.iso9660</code> is less common, but also in use) and are commonly referred to as \"ISOs\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gavin|first=Brady|title=What Is An ISO File (And How Do I Use Them)?|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/356714/what-is-an-iso-file-and-how-do-i-open-one/|access-date=2021-12-23|website=How-To Geek|date=25 June 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Platforms ==\n\nMost operating systems support reading of ISO 9660 formatted discs, and most new versions support the extensions such as Rock Ridge and Joliet.

The 3270 was the successor to the [[IBM 2260]] display terminal.<ref name=Chicken.egg>{{cite web\n   |title=What is 3270 (Information Display System)\n   |url=https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/3270-Information-Display-System\n   |quote=3270 .. over its predecessor, the 2260}}</ref> Due to the text color on the original models, these terminals are informally known as ''[[Monochrome monitor|green screen]]'' terminals. Unlike a [[character-oriented terminal]], the 3270 minimizes the number of [[input/output|I/O]] [[interrupt]]s required by transferring large blocks of data known as [[data stream]]s, and uses a high speed proprietary communications interface, using [[coaxial cable]].\n\nIBM no longer manufactures 3270 terminals, but the IBM 3270 protocol is still commonly used<ref>{{cite web\n   |title=Cleo 3270 Support Documentation\n   |url=http://www.cleo.com/support/byproduct/en/documentation/3270sna_tn/3270-encryption.php\n   |quote=IBM stopped manufacturing .. the IBM 3270}}</ref> via TN3270{{sfn|RFC2355}} clients, [[3270 emulator|3270 terminal emulation]] or web interfaces to access mainframe-based applications, which are sometimes referred to as ''green screen applications''.\n\n==Principles==\nThe 3270 series was designed to connect with mainframe computers, often at a remote location, using the technology then available in the early 1970s.<ref name=I.7/> The main goal of the system was to maximize the number of terminals that could be used on a single mainframe. To do this, the 3270 was designed to minimize the amount of data transmitted, and minimize the frequency of interrupts to the mainframe. By ensuring the CPU is not interrupted at every keystroke, a 1970s-era [[IBM 303X#IBM 3033|IBM 3033]] mainframe fitted with only 16&nbsp;MB of [[main memory]] was able to support up to 17,500 3270 terminals under [[CICS]].\n\n[[File:IBM 3270 cluster diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Sample IBM 3270 cluster with one control unit connected to a printer and two displays]] \nMost 3270 devices are ''clustered'', with one or more displays or printers connected to a ''control unit'' (the 3275 and 3276 included an integrated control unit).<ref>{{cite magazine  |magazine=[[Computerworld]]  |date=May 13, 1985  |page=103 |title=3270 clusters\n   |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKyJOEl_vlsC}}</ref> Originally devices were connected to the control unit over coaxial cable; later [[Token Ring]], [[twisted pair]], or [[Ethernet]] connections were available.  A ''local'' control unit attaches directly to the [[Channel I/O|channel]] of a nearby mainframe.  A ''remote'' control unit is connected to a communications line by a [[modem]].  Remote 3270 controllers are frequently ''[[Telecommunications link#Multipoint|multi-dropped]]'', with multiple control units on a line.\n\nIBM 3270 devices are connected to a 3299 multiplexer or to the cluster controller, e.g., 3271, 3272, 3274, 3174, using RG-62, 93 ohm, coax cables in a point to point configuration with one dedicated cable per terminal. Data is sent with a bit rate of 2.3587 Mbit/s using a slightly modified [[differential Manchester encoding]]. Cable runs of up to {{Cvt|1500|m|ft}} are supported, although IBM documents routinely stated the maximum supported coax cable length was {{Cvt|2000|ft|m}}.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/3270/GA27-2739-1_An_Introduction_to_the_IBM_3270_Information_Display_System_May71.pdf|title=An Introduction to the IBM 3270 Information Systems Display System|publisher=IBM|year=1971|pages=2-2,8-1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/3270/fe/S229-7037-4_3270_Maintenance_Handbook_Sep80.pdf|title=IBM 3270 Information Display System|publisher=IBM|year=1980|pages=1–3}}</ref> Originally devices were equipped with [[BNC connector]]s, which later was replaced with special so-called DPC – Dual Purpose Connectors supporting the IBM Shielded twisted pair cabling system without the need for so-called red [[balun]]s.\n\nIn a data stream, both text and control (or formatting functions) are interspersed allowing an entire screen to be painted as a single output operation. The concept of formatting in these devices allows the screen to be divided into fields (clusters of contiguous character cells) for which numerous field attributes, e.g., color,{{efn|When the Structured Field and Attribute Processing Option is available|name=extended}} highlighting, character set,{{efn|name=extended}} protection from modification, can be set. A field attribute occupies a physical location on the screen that also determines the beginning and end of a field. There are also{{efn|name=extended}} character attributes associated with individual screen locations.\n\nUsing a technique known as read modified,<ref>{{cite web\n   |title=Formatted screen input\n   |website=[[IBM]]\n   |date=April 27, 2004\n |url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_4.2.0/com.ibm.cics.ts.applicationprogramming.doc/topics/dfhp31g.html\n   |quote=.. reads a 3270 screen with a ''read modified'' command}}</ref>  a single transmission back to the mainframe can contain the changes from any number of formatted fields that have been modified, but without sending any unmodified fields or static data.  This technique enhances the terminal throughput of the [[Central processing unit|CPU]], and minimizes the data transmitted. Some users familiar with character interrupt-driven terminal interfaces find this technique unusual. There is also a read buffer<ref>{{cite web\n   |title=Reading from a 3270 terminal\n   |website=[[IBM]]\n   |url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.4.0/applications/designing/dfhp3b8.html\n   |quote=There are two ... , read buffer and read modified.}}</ref> capability that transfers the entire content of the 3270-[[screen buffer]] including field attributes. This is mainly used for debugging purposes to preserve the application program screen contents while replacing it, temporarily, with debugging information.\n\nEarly 3270s offered three types of keyboards.  The ''typewriter keyboard'' came in both a 66 key version, with no [[function key|programmed function (PF) keys]], and a 78 key version with twelve.  Both versions had two ''Program Attention'' (PA) keys.<ref name=\"horswill\">{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMGV_3.1.0/com.ibm.cics.ts31.doc/dfhp3/dfhp3b5.htm\n   |title=Input from a 3270 terminal\n   |website=[[IBM]]\n   |quote=PA (Program Attention) key}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n   |title=Designing and Programming CICS Applications\n   |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1565926765  |isbn=1-56592-676-5\n   |author=John Horswill  |date=2000\n   | publisher=\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\" |quote=DFHPA1 is Program Attention (PA) Key 1}}</ref> The ''data entry keyboard'' had five PF keys and two PA keys. The ''operator console keyboard'' had twelve PF keys and two PA keys.<ref name=CompDesc />{{rp|p.19}}  Later 3270s had an Attention{{efn|SNA only, causes an ''expedited flow'' attention signal even if the keyboard is locked.}} key, a Cursor  Select{{efn|Pressing Cursoe Select has the same effect as clicking a Selector Pen at the current cursor location.}} key, a System Request key, twenty-four PF keys and three PA keys. There was also a TEST REQ key. When one of these keys is pressed, it will cause its control unit to generate an I/O [[interrupt]]{{efn|For local non-SNA controllers. If attached to an [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA]] controller, it initiates a Read Modied or Short AID data transfer. For BSC controllers it causes a positive response to the next poll.}} to the host computer and present an ''Attention ID'' (AID) identifying which key was pressed. Application program functions such as termination, page-up, page-down, or help can be invoked by a single key press, thereby reducing the load on very busy processors.\n\nA downside to this approach was that [[vi]]-like behavior, responding to individual keystrokes, was not possible. For the same reason, a port of [[Lotus 1-2-3]] to mainframes with 3279 screens did not meet with success because its programmers were not able to properly adapt the spreadsheet's user interface to a screen at a time rather than character at a time device. But end-user responsiveness was arguably more predictable with 3270, something users appreciated.\n\n==Applications==\nFollowing its introduction the 3270 and compatibles were by far the most commonly used terminals on [[IBM System/370]] and successor systems.<ref name=HOB>{{cite web\n   |author=Klaus Brandstaetter\n   |title=3270 -Brief History\n   |url=http://www.hob-techtalk.com/2008/09/12/3270-a-brief-history\n   |website=HOB Techtalk\n   |access-date=August 19, 2015\n   |archive-date=February 16, 2012\n   |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216195850/http://www.hob-techtalk.com/2008/09/12/3270-a-brief-history\n   }}</ref>  IBM and third-party software that included an interactive component took for granted the presence of 3270 terminals and provided a set of [[ISPF]] [[Panel (computer software)|panels]] and supporting programs.\n\n[[Conversational Monitor System]] (CMS) in [[VM (operating system)|VM]] has support for the 3270<ref>{{cite manual\n  |title=IBM Virtual Machine Facility/370: Terminal User's Guide\n  |id=GC20-1810-6 \n  |edition=Seventh\n  |date=October 1974\n  |url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/370/VM_370/Release_3/GC20-1810-6_VM370_Terminal_Users_Guide_Rel_3_1976.pdf\n  |publisher=International Business Machines Corporation   |mode=cs2}}\n</ref> continuing to [[z/VM]].\n\n[[Time Sharing Option]] (TSO) in [[OS/360 and successors]] has line mode command line support and also has facilities for full screen applications, e.g., [[ISPF]].\n\nDevice independent Display Operator Console Support (DIDOCS) in Multiple Console Support (MCS) for OS/360 and successors supports 3270 devices and, in fact, MCS in current versions of MVS no longer supports line mode,{{efn|Other than the [[IBM Hardware Management Console|Hardware Management Console (HMC)]]}} 2250 and 2260 devices.\n\nThe SPF and [[ISPF#ISPF Editor|''Program Development Facility'']] (ISPF/PDF) [[Text editor|editors]] for [[MVS]] and [[VM (operating system)|VM/SP]] (ISPF/PDF was available for VM, but little used) and the [[XEDIT]] [[Text editor|editors]] for [[VM (operating system)|VM/SP]] through z/VM make extensive use of 3270 features.\n\n[[CICS|Customer Information Control System]] (CICS) has support for 3270 panels.  Indeed, from the early 1970s on, CICS applications were often written for the 3270.<ref name=\"horswill\"/>{{rp|195ff}}\n\nVarious versions of [[ORVYL and WYLBUR|Wylbur]] have support for 3270, including support for full-screen applications.\n\nMcGill University's [[MUSIC/SP]] operating system provided support for 3270 terminals and applications, including a full-screen text editor, a menu system, and a PANEL facility to create 3270 full-screen applications. \n\nThe modified data tag is well suited to converting formatted, structured punched card input onto the 3270 display device. With the appropriate programming, any batch program that uses formatted, structured card input can be layered onto a 3270 terminal.\n\nIBM's [[OfficeVision]] office productivity software enjoyed great success with 3270 interaction because of its design understanding. And for many years the [[PROFS]] calendar was the most commonly displayed screen on office terminals around the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}\n\nA version of the [[WordPerfect]] [[word processor]] ported to [[IBM System/370|System/370]] was designed for the 3270 architecture.\n\n== SNA ==\n3270 devices can be a part of an [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA – System Network Architecture]] network or non-SNA network. If the controllers are SNA connected, they appear to SNA as PU – Physical Unit type 2.0 (PU2.1 for APPN) nodes typically with LU – Logical Unit type 1, 2, and 3 devices connected. Local, channel attached, controllers are controlled by [[Virtual Telecommunications Access Method|VTAM – Virtual Telecommunications Access Method]]. Remote controllers are controlled by the NCP – Network Control Program in the [[Front-end processor|Front End Processor]] i.e. [[IBM 3705 Communications Controller|3705]], [[IBM 3720|3720]], [[IBM 37xx|3725]], [[IBM 3745|3745]], and VTAM.\n\n==Third parties==\nOne of the first groups to write and provide operating system support for the 3270 and its early predecessors was the University of Michigan, who created the [[Michigan Terminal System]] in order for the hardware to be useful outside of the manufacturer.{{clarify|date=August 2017}}  MTS was the default OS at Michigan for many years, and was still used at Michigan well into the 1990s.\nMany manufacturers, such as [[GTE]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Honeywell]]/Incoterm Div, [[Memorex]], [[ITT Corporation|ITT Courier]], [[McData]], Harris, [[Alfaskop]] and [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]]/[[AT&T]] created 3270 compatible{{efn|Some, such as the GTE IS/7800, were not fully compatible.}} terminals, or adapted ASCII terminals such as the [[HP 2640]] series to have a similar block-mode capability that would transmit a screen at a time, with some form validation capability. The industry distinguished between 'System compatible controllers' and 'Plug compatibility controllers', where 'System compatibility' meant that the 3rd party system was compatible with the 3270 data stream terminated in the unit, but not as 'Plug compatibility' equipment, also were compatible at the coax level thereby allowing IBM terminals to be connected to a 3rd party controller or vice versa. Modern applications are sometimes built upon legacy 3270 applications, using software utilities to capture ([[Data scraping#Screen scraping|screen scraping]]) screens and transfer the data to web pages or GUI interfaces.\n\nIn the early 1990s a popular solution to link PCs with the mainframes was the [[Irma board]], an [[expansion card]] that plugged into a PC and connected to the controller through a coaxial cable. 3270 simulators for IRMA and similar adapters typically provide file transfers between the PC and the mainframe using the same protocol as the [[IBM 3270 PC]].{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}\n\n==Models==\n[[File:IBM 3270 terminal with Selector Pen.jpg|thumb|IBM selector-pen in use]]\nThe IBM 3270 display terminal subsystem consists of displays, printers and controllers.\nOptional features for the 3275 and 3277 are the ''selector-pen'',{{efn|Similar to a [[light pen]], but only allows selecting a field rather than requesting movement.|name=sel}} ASCII rather than [[EBCDIC]] character set, an audible alarm, and a keylock for the keyboard.  A ''keyboard numeric lock'' was available and will lock the keyboard if the operator attempts to enter non-numeric data into a field defined as numeric.<ref name=CompDesc>{{cite book\n   |author=IBM Corporation\n   |title=IBM 3270 Information Display System Component Description\n   |id=GA27-2749-1\n   |year=1972 \n   |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/3270/GA27-2749-1_IBM_3270_Information_Display_System_Component_Description_Jun72.pdf\n   }}\n</ref> Later an ''Operator Identification Card Reader'' was added which could read information encoded on a [[magnetic stripe card]].\n\n===Displays===\nGenerally, 3277 models allow only upper-case input, except for the mixed EBCDIC/APL or ''text'' keyboards, which have lower case. Lower-case capability and [[dead key]]s were available as an [[RPQ]] (''Request Price Quotation''); these were added to the later 3278 & 3279 models.\n\nA version of the [[IBM PC]] called the [[IBM 3270 PC|3270 PC]], released in October 1983, includes 3270 [[terminal emulator|terminal emulation]]. Later, the 3270 PC/G (graphics), 3270 PC/GX (extended graphics), 3270 Personal Computer AT, 3270 PC AT/G (graphics) and 3270 PC AT/GX (extended graphics) followed.\n\n====CUT vs. DFT====\nThere are two types of 3270 displays in respect to where the 3270 data stream terminates. For CUT (Control Unit Terminal) displays, the stream terminates in the display controller, the controller instructs the display to move the cursor, position a character, etc. EBCDIC is translated by the controller into '3270 Character Set', and keyboard scan-codes from the terminal, read by the controller through a poll, is translated by the controller into EBCDIC. For DFT (Distributed Function Terminal) type displays, most of the 3270 data stream is forwarded to the display by the controller. The display interprets the 3270 protocol itself.\n\nIn addition to passing the 3270 data stream directly to the terminal, allowing for features like EAB - Extended Attributes, Graphics, etc., DFT also enabled multi sessions (up to 5 simultaneous), featured in the 3290 and 3194 multisession displays.

The first was implemented in the optional Programmed Symbol Sets{{sfn|3270ColorPSS|loc=Chapter 7 Programmed Symbols Capability|pp=[http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/3278/GA33-3056-0_3270_Information_Display_System_Color_and_Programmed_Symbols_3278_3279_3287_Sep1979.pdf#page-52 7{{hyphen}}1{{ndash}}7{{hyphen}}7] }} (PSS) of the 3278, 3279 and 3287, which became a standard feature on the later 3279-S3G, a.k.a. 3279G, and was based on piecing together graphics with on-the-fly custom-defined symbols downloaded to the terminal.\n\nThe second later implementation provided All Points Addressable (APA) graphics, a.k.a. Vector Graphics, allowing more efficient graphics than the older technique. The first terminal to support APA / Vector graphics was the 3179G terminal that later was replaced by first the 3192G and later the 3472G.\n\nBoth implementations are supported by [[Graphical Data Display Manager|IBM GDDM]] - Graphical Data Display Manager first released in 1979, and by [[SAS (software)|SAS]] with their SAS/GRAPH software.\n\n=====IBM 3279G=====\nIBM 3279-S3G, a.k.a. 3279G, terminal, announced in 1979, was IBM's graphics replacement for the 3279-3B with PSS. The terminal supported 7 colors and the graphics were made up of Programmable Symbol sets loaded to the terminal by the graphical application [[Graphical Data Display Manager|GDDM - Graphical Data Display Manager]] using Write Structured Field command.\n\nProgrammable Symbols is an addition to the normal base character set consisting of [[Latin script|Latin characters]], numbers, etc. hardwired into the terminal. The 3279G supports six additional sets of symbols each supporting 190 symbols, resulting in a total of 1.140 programmable symbols. Three of the Programmable Symbols sets have three planes each enabling coloring (red, blue, green) the Programmable Symbols downloaded to those sets, thereby supporting a total of seven colors.\n\nEach 'character' cell consists of a 9x12 or a 9x16 dot matrix depending on the screen model. In order to program a cell with a symbol 18 bytes of data is needed making the data load quite heavy in some instances when compared to classic text screens.\n\nIf one for example wishes to draw a hyperbola on the screen, the application must first compute the required Programmable Symbols to make up hyperbola and load them to the terminal. The next step is then for the application to paint the screen by addressing the screen cell position and select the appropriate symbol in one of the Programmable Symbols sets.\n\nThe 3279G could be ordered with Attribute Select Keyboard enabling the operator to select attributes, colors and Programmable Symbols sets, making that version of the terminal quite distinctive.\n\n=====IBM 3179G=====\n{{Infobox information appliance\n| name         = IBM 3179G\n| title        = \n| aka          = IBM 3179G Color Display Station\n| logo         = \n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| developer    = \n| manufacturer = [[IBM]]\n| family       = \n| type         = \n| generation   = \n| releasedate  = {{Start date|1984|03}}\n| lifespan     = \n| price        = {{USD|2295|1984}}\n| discontinued = \n| unitssold    = \n| unitsshipped = \n| media        = \n| os           = \n| power        = \n| soc          = \n| cpu          = \n| memory       = \n| storage      = \n| memory card  = \n| display      = \n| graphics     = \n| sound        = \n| input        = \n| controllers  = \n| camera       = \n| touchpad     = \n| connectivity = \n| platform     = \n| service      = \n| dimensions   = \n| weight       = \n| topgame      = \n| compatibility= \n| predecessor  = \n| successor    = IBM 3192-G\n| related      = \n| website      = <!--{{URL|example.org}}-->\n}}\nThe '''IBM 3179G''' announced June 18, 1985,<ref>{{cite web\n |     title = IBM 3179 Color Graphics Display Station Models G1 and G2 and IBM 3979 Expansion Unit\n |        id = LTR 185-076\n |      date = June 18, 1985\n |      department= Announcement Letters\n |     quote = The IBM 3179 Color Graphics Display Station Models G1 and G2 and the IBM 3979 Expansion Unit are the latest members of the IBM 3270 Information Display System graphics family of products.

As well as being separate layers on the screen, the text and graphics layers are sent to the display in separate data streams, making them completely independent.\n\nThe application i.e. [[Graphical Data Display Manager|GDDM]] sends the vector definitions to the 3179-G, and the work of activating the pixels that represent the picture (the vector-to-raster conversion) is done in the terminal itself. The datastream is related to the number of graphics primitives (lines, arcs, and so on) in the picture. Arcs are split into short vectors, that are sent to the 3179-G to be drawn. The 3179-G does not store graphic data, and so cannot offload any manipulation function from GDDM. In particular, with user control, each new viewing operation means that the data has to be regenerated and retransmitted.\n\nThe 3179G is a distributed function terminal (DFT) and requires a downstream load (DSL) to load its microcode from the cluster controller's floppy disk or hard drive.\n\nThe G10 model is a standard 122-key typewriter keyboard, while the G20 model offers [[APL programming language|APL]] on the same layout. Compatible with [[System/370|IBM System/370]], [[IBM 4300 series]], 303x, 308x, [[IBM 3090]], and [[IBM 9370]].\n\n===== IBM 3192G =====\n<dfn>The IBM 3192G, announced in</dfn> 1987 <dfn>was the</dfn> successor to 3179G. It featured 16 colors, and support for printers (i.e., IBM Proprinter) for local hardcopy with graphical support, or system printer, text only, implemented as an additional LU.\n\n=====IBM 3472G=====\nThe IBM 3472G announced in 1989 was the successor to 3192G and featured five concurrent sessions, one of which could be graphics. Unlike the 3192-G, it needed no expansion unit to attach a mouse or color plotter, and it could also attach a tablet device for digitised input and a bar code reader.\n\n=== APL / APL2 ===\nMost IBM terminals, starting with the 3277, could be delivered with an [[APL (programming language)|APL]] keyboard, allowing the operator/programmer to enter APL symbolic instructions directly into the editor. In order to display APL symbols on the terminal, it had to be equipped with an APL character set in addition to the normal 3270-character set. The APL character set is addressed with a preceding Graphic Escape X'08' instruction.\n\nWith the advent of the graphic terminal 3179G, the APL character set was expandable to 138 characters, called APL2. The added characters were: Diamond, Quad Null, Iota Underbar, Epsilon Underbar, Left Tack, Right Tack, Equal Underbar, Squished Quad, Quad Slope, and Dieresis Dot. Later APL2 symbols were supported by 3191 Models D, E, L, the CUT version of 3192, and 3472.\n\nPlease note that IBM's version's of APL also is called APL2.\n\n===Display-Controller===\n* 3275 remote display with controller function (no additional displays up to one printer)\n* 3276 remote display with controller function.  IBM 3276, announced in 1981, was a combined remote controller and display terminal, offering support for up to 8 displays, the 3276 itself included. By default, the 3276 had two type A coax ports, one for its own display, and one free for an additional terminal or printer. Up to three additional adapters, each supporting two coax devices, could be installed. The 3276 could connect to a non-SNA or SNA host using BSC or SDLC with line speed of up to 9,600 bit/s. The 3276 looked very much like the 3278 terminal, and the terminal feature of the 3276 itself, was more or less identical to those of the 3278.\n\n===Printers===\n[[File:IBM 4224 matrix printer (1).jpg|thumb|4224 printer]]\n* 3284 matrix printer\n* 3286 matrix printer\n* 3287 printer, including a color model\n* 3288 line printer\n* 3268-1 R-loop connected stand-alone printer for the [[IBM 8100]] system\n* 4224 matrix printer\nIn 1984 announced [[IBM Intelligent Printer Data Stream|IPDS – Intelligent Printer Data Stream]] for online printing of [[Advanced Function Presentation|AFP - Advanced Function Presentation]] documents, using bidirectional communications between the application and the printer. IPDS support among others printing of text, fonts, images, graphics, and barcodes. The IBM 4224 is one of the IPDS capable dot matrix printers.\n\nWith the emergence of printers, including [[Laser printing|laser printers]], from [[HP LaserJet|HP]], [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], and others, targeted the PC market, 3270 customers got an alternative to IBM 3270 printers by connecting this type of printers through printer protocol converters from manufactures like I-data, MPI Tech, Adacom, and others. The printer protocol converters basically emulate a 3287 type printer, and later extended to support IPDS.\n\nThe IBM 3482 terminal, announced in 1992, offered a printer port, which could be used for host addressable printing as well as local screen copy. <code> </code>\n\nIn the later versions of 3174 the Asynchronous Emulation Adapter (AEA), supporting async RS-232 character-based type terminals, was enhanced to support printers equipped with a serial interface.\n\n=== Controllers ===\n[[File:IBM 3174 controller.jpg|thumb|IBM 3174 controller]]\n[[File:IBM 3174-1L as terminal of Primary Server of Biblioteca Nacional (Front) (1).jpg|thumb|IBM 3274-41D controller with terminal]]\n* 3271 remote controller\n* 3272 local controller\n* 3274 cluster controller (different models could be channel-attached or remote via [[Binary Synchronous Communications|BSC]]  or [[Synchronous Data Link Control|SDLC]] communication lines, and had between eight and 32 co-ax ports)\n* 3174 cluster controller{{sfn|3174Intro|loc=Chapter 1 Introducing the 3174 Establishment Controller - Figure 1-1 Overview of the IBM 3174 Establishment Controller Attachment|p=[http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/3174/GA27-3850-0_3174_Establishment_Controller_Introduction_Apr89.pdf#page=13 1-2]}}\n\nOn the 3274 and 3174, IBM used the term '''configuration support''' ''letter'', sometimes followed by a release number, to designate a list of features together with the hardware and microcode needed to support them.\n\nBy 1994 the 3174 Establishment Controller supported features such as attachment to multiple hosts via [[Token Ring]], [[Ethernet]], or [[X.25]] in addition to the standard channel attach or SDLC; terminal attachment via [[twisted pair]], Token Ring or Ethernet in addition to co-ax; and TN3270.  They also support attachment of asynchronous ASCII terminals, printers, and plotters alongside 3270 devices.<ref>{{cite book|last=IBM Corporation|title=3174 Establishment Controller/Networking Server Installation Guide|year=1994|url=http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/gg243061.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302094553/http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/gg243061.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-02}}</ref>\n\n==== 3274 controller ====\nIBM introduced the 3274 controller family in 1977, replacing the 3271–2 product line.\n\nWhere the features of the 3271–2 was hardcoded, the 3274 was controlled by its microcode that was read from the 3274's built-in [[8\" floppy drive]].\n\n3274 models included 8, 12, 16, and 32 port remote controllers and 32-port local channel attached units. In total 16 different models were over time released to the market. The 3274-1A was an SNA physical Unit type 2.0 (PU2.0), required only a single address on the channel for all 32 devices and was not compatible with the 3272. The 3274-1B and 3274-1D were compatible with the 3272 and were referred to as local non-SNA models.\n\nThe 3274 controllers introduced a new generation of the coax protocol, named Category A, to differentiate them from the Category B coax devices, such as the 3277 terminal and the 3284 printer. The first Category A coax devices were the 3278 and the first color terminal, the IBM 3279 Color Display Station.\n\nEnabling backward compatibility, it was possible to install coax boards, so-called 'panels', in groups of 4 or 8 supporting the now older Category B coax devices. A maximum of 16 Category B terminals could be supported, and only 8 if the controller were fully loaded with a maximum of 4 panels each supporting 8 Category A devices.\n\nDuring its life span, the 3274 supported several features including:\n\n* Extended Data Stream\n* Extended Highlighting\n* Programmed Symbol Set (PSS)\n* V.24 interfaces with speed up to 14.4 kbit/s\n* V.35 interfaces with speed up to 56 kbit/s\n* X.25 network attachment\n* DFT – Distributed Function Terminal\n* DSL – Downstream load for 3290 and 3179G\n* 9901 and 3299 multiplexer\n* Entry Assist\n* Dual Logic (the feature of having two sessions from a CUT mode display).\n\n==== 3174 controller ====\nIBM introduced the 3174{{sfn|3174Intro}} Subsystem Control Unit in 1986, replacing the 3274 product line.\n\nThe 3174 was designed to enhance the 3270 product line with many new connectivity options and features. Like the 3274, it was customizable, the main difference was that it used smaller (5.25-inch) diskettes than the 3274 (8-inch diskettes), and that the larger floor models had 10 slots for adapters, some of them were per default occupied by channel adapter/serial interface, coax adapter, etc. Unlike the 3274, any local models could be configured as either local SNA or local non-SNA, including PU2.1 (APPN).\n<!-- Or did you need 3174-11L? -->\n\nThe models included: 01L, 01R, 02R, 03R, 51R, 52R, 53R, 81R and 82R.\n\nThe 01L were local channel attached, the R models remotely connected, and the x3R Token Ring (upstream) connected. The 0xL/R models were floor units supporting up to 32 coax devices through the use of internal or external multiplexers (TMA/3299). The 5xR, models were shelf units with 9 coax ports, expandable to 16, by the connection of a 3299 multiplexer. The smallest desktop units, 8xR, had 4 coax ports expandable to 8, by the connection of a 3299 multiplexer.\n\nIn the 3174 controller line IBM also slightly altered the classical [[BNC connector|BNC]] coax connector by changing the BNC connector to DPC – Dual Purpose Connector. The DPC female connector was a few millimeters longer and with a built-in switch that detected if a normal BNC connector were connected or a newer DPC connector was connected, thereby changing the physical layer from 93 ohm unbalanced coax, to 150 ohm balanced twisted-pair, thereby directly supporting the IBM Cabling system without the need for a so-called red balun.\n\nConfiguration Support A was the first microcode offered with the 3174. It supported all the hardware modules present at the time, almost all the microcode features found in 3274 and introduced a number of new features including: Intelligent Printer Data Stream (IPDS), Multiple Logical Terminals, Country Extended Code Page (CECP), Response Time Monitor, and Token Ring configured as host interface.\n\nConfiguration Support S, strangely following release A, introduced that a local or remote controller could act as 3270 Token-Ring DSPU Gateway, supporting up to 80 Downstream PU's.\n\nIn 1989, IBM introduced a new range of 3174 models and changed the name from 3174 Subsystem Control Unit to 3174 Establishment Controller. The main new feature was support for an additional 32 coax port in floor models.\n\nThe models included: 11L, 11R, 12R, 13R, 61R, 62R, 63R, 91R, and 92R.\n\nThe new line of controllers came with Configuration Support B release 1, increased the number of supported DSPU on the Token-Ring gateway to 250 units, and introduced at the same time 'Group Polling' that offloaded the mainframe/VTAM polling requirement on the channel.\n\nConfiguration Support B release 2 to 5, enabled features like: Local Format Storage (CICS Screen Buffer), Type Ahead, Null/Space Processing, ESCON channel support.\n\nIn 1990–1991, a total of 7 more models were added: 21R, 21L, 12L, 22L, 22R, 23R, and 90R. The 12L offered ESCON fibreoptic channel attachment. The models with 2xx designation were equal to the 1xx models but repacked for rackmount and offered only 4 adapter slots. The 90R was not intended as a coax controller, it was positioned as a Token Ring 3270 DSPU gateway. However, it did have one coax port for configuring the unit, which with a 3299 multiplexer could be expanded to 8.\n\nThe line of controllers came with Configuration Support C to support ISDN, APPN and Peer Communication. The ISDN feature allowed downstream devices, typically PC's, to connect to the 3174 via the ISDN network. The APPN support enabled the 3174 to be a part of an APPN network, and the Peer Communication allowed coax attached PC's with 'Peer Communication Support' to access resources on the Token-Ring network attached to the 3174.\n\nThe subsequent releases 2 to 6 of Configuration Support C enables support for: Split screen, Copy from session to session, Calculator function, Access to AS/400 host and 5250 keyboard emulation, Numerous APPN enhancements, TCP/IP Telnet support that allowed 3270 CUT terminals to communicate with TCP/IP servers using Telnet, and at the same time in another screen to communicate with the mainframe using native 3270. TN3270 support where the 3174 could connect to a TN3270 host/gateway, eliminating SNA, but preserving the 3270 data stream. IP forwarding allowing bridging of LAN (Token-Ring or Ethernet) connected devices downstream to the 3174 to route IP traffic onto the Frame Relay WAN interface.\n\nIn 1993, three new models were added with the announcement of Ethernet Adapter (FC 3045). The models were: 14R, 24R, and 64R.\n\nThis was also IBM's final hardware announcement of 3174.\n\nThe floor models, and the rack-mountable units, could be expanded with a range of special 3174 adapters, that by 1993 included: Channel adapter, ESCON adapter, Serial (V.24/V.35) adapter, Concurrent Communication Adapter, Coax adapter, Fiber optic \"coax\" adapter, Async adapter, ISDN adapter, Token-Ring adapter, Ethernet adapter, and line encryption adapter.\n\nIn 1994, IBM incorporated the functions of RPQ 8Q0935 into Configuration Support-C release 3, including the TN3270 client.<ref>{{cite manual\n |       title = Using 3174 in TCP/IP Networks\n |          id = GG24-4172-00\n |        date = June 1994\n |     edition = First\n |     section = Chapter 9 3174 TCP/IP Enhancements RPQ 8Q1041 - 9.7 TN3270\n | section-url = http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/3174/GG24-4172-0_Using_3174_in_TCP_IP_Networks_Jun94.pdf#page=298\n |       pages = 269–272\n |         url = http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/3174/GG24-4172-0_Using_3174_in_TCP_IP_Networks_Jun94.pdf\n |        work = Redbooks\n |   publisher = IBM\n }}\n</ref>\n\n====Non-IBM Controllers====\n=====GTE=====\nThe GTE IS/7800 Video Display Systems used one of two nominally IBM compatible controllers:\n\n* 7801 (remote, 3271 equivalent)\n* 7802 (local, 3277 equivalent)\n\n=====Harris=====\nThe Harris 8000 Series Terminal Systems used one of four controllers:\n\n* 8171 (remote, 3271 equivalent)\n* 8172 (local, 3277 equivalent)\n* 8181 (remote, 3271 equivalent)\n* 8182 (local, 3277 equivalent)\n* 9116\n* 9210\n* 9220\n\n=====Home grown=====\nAn alternative implementation of an establishment controller exists in form of OEC (Open Establishment Controller).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ajk.me/building-an-ibm-3270-terminal-controller|title = Building an IBM 3270 terminal controller}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/lowobservable/oec|title=Oec|website=[[GitHub]] |date=October 4, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/lowobservable/coax|title = Coax| website=[[GitHub]] |date = October 16, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/lowobservable/pytn3270|title = Pytn3270| website=[[GitHub]] |date = October 4, 2021}}</ref> It's a combination of an [[Arduino]] [[Arduino#Shields|shield]] with a [[BNC connector|BNC]] connector and a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] program that runs on a [[POSIX]] system.

The internal 3174 multiplexer card was named TMA – Terminal Multiplexer adapter 9176.\n\nA number of vendors manufactured 3270 multiplexers before and alongside IBM including Fibronics and Adacom offering multiplexers that supported [[Twisted pair|TTP – Telephone Twisted Pair]] as an alternative to coax, and fiber-optic links between the multiplexers.\n\nIn some instances, the multiplexer worked as an \"expansion\" unit on smaller remote controllers including the 3174-81R / 91R, where the 3299 expanded the number of coax ports from four to eight, or the 3174-51R / 61R, where the 3299 expanded the number of coax ports from eight to 16.\n\n==Manufacture==\nThe IBM 3270 display terminal subsystem was designed and developed by IBM's [[Kingston, New York]], laboratory (which later closed during [[History of IBM#1993–2018: IBM's near disaster and rebirth|IBM's difficult time]] in the mid-1990s). The printers were developed by the [[Endicott, New York]], laboratory.  As the subsystem expanded, the 3276 display-controller was developed by the [[IBM Fujisawa|Fujisawa laboratory]], Japan, and later the [[IBM Yamato Facility|Yamato laboratory]]; and the 3279 color display and 3287 color printer by the [[IBM Hursley|Hursley]], UK, laboratory.  The subsystem products were manufactured in Kingston (displays and controllers), Endicott (printers), and [[Greenock]], Scotland, UK, (most products) and shipped to users in U.S. and worldwide. 3278 terminals continued to be manufactured in [[Hortolândia]], near [[Campinas]], Brazil as far as late 1980s, having its internals redesigned by a local engineering team using modern CMOS technology, while retaining its external look and feel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n==Telnet 3270==\nTelnet 3270, or '''tn3270''' describes both the process of sending and receiving 3270 data streams using the [[telnet]] protocol and the software that emulates a 3270 class terminal that communicates using that process.{{sfn|RFC2355}}{{sfn|RFC6270}} tn3270 allows a 3270 [[terminal emulator]] to communicate over a [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] network instead of an [[System network architecture|SNA]] network. Telnet 3270 can be used for either terminal or print connections.  Standard [[telnet]] clients cannot be used as a substitute for tn3270 clients, as they use fundamentally different techniques for exchanging data.\n\n==Technical Information==\n\n===3270 character set===\nThe 3270 displays are available with a variety{{sfn|3270CS}} of keyboards and character sets.

One indicates that only numeric input is accepted, and automatically shifts to numeric for some keyboards.\n* Bit 4 and 5 operate in tandem: \n** '00'B indicate that the field is displayed on the screen and is not ''selector-pen detectable''.\n** '01'B indicates that the field is displayable and selector-pen detectable.\n** '10'B indicates that the field is ''intensified'' (bright), displayable, and selector-pen detectable.\n** '11'B indicates that the field is non-display, non-printable, and not pen detectable. This last can be used in conjunction with the modified data tag to imbed static data on the screen that will be read each time data was read from the device.\n* Bit 7 is the \"Modified Data Tag\", where '0' indicates that the associated field has not been modified by the operator and '1' indicates that it has been modified. As noted above, this bit can be set programmatically to cause the field to be treated as modified.\n\nLater models include ''base color'': \"Base color (four colors) can be produced on color displays and color printers from current 3270 application programs by use of combinations of the field intensify and field protection attribute bits.

For example, a 3277 model 2 featured a screen size of 24 rows of 80 columns for a buffer size of 1920 bytes.  Bytes are addressed from zero to the screen size minus one, in this example 1919.  \"There is a fixed relationship between each ... buffer storage location and its position on the display screen.\"<ref name=CompDesc />{{rp|p.13}}  Most orders start operation at the \"current\" buffer address, and executing an order or writing data will update this address.  The buffer address can be set directly using the ''Set Buffer Address (SBA)'' order, often followed by ''Start Field'' or ''Start Field Extended''.  For a device with a 1920 character display a twelve bit address is sufficient.  Later 3270s with larger screen sizes use fourteen or sixteen bits.\n\nAddresses are encoded within orders in two bytes.{{sfn|3270DS|loc=Appendix D. 12-, 14-, and 16-Bit Addressing|pp=D-1{{snd}}D-2}}  For twelve bit addresses the high order two bits of each byte are set to form valid EBCDIC (or ASCII) characters.  For example, address 0 is coded as X'4040', or space-space, address 1919 is coded as X'5D7F', or '{{not a typo|\"}}'.<ref name=CompDesc />{{rp|pp.75–90}}  Programmers hand-coding panels usually keep the table of addresses from the 3270 Component Description or the 3270 Reference Card handy. For fourteen and sixteen-bit address, the address uses contiguous bits in two bytes.\n\n====Example====\nThe following data stream writes an attribute in row 24, column 1, writes the (protected) characters '> ' in row 24, columns 2 and 3, and creates an unprotected field on row 24 from columns 5-79.

It was based on the [[Intel 8086]] and, like it, had a [[16-bit computing|16-bit]] external [[Bus (computing)#Address bus|data bus]] multiplexed with a 20-bit [[address bus]]. The [[Intel 80188|80188 variant]], with an [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] external data bus was also available.\n\n==Description==\nThe 80186 series was generally intended for [[embedded system]]s, as [[microcontroller]]s with external memory. Therefore, to reduce the number of [[integrated circuits]] required, it included features such as [[clock generator]], [[programmable interrupt controller|interrupt controller]], [[hardware timer|timer]]s, [[wait state]] generator, [[direct memory access|DMA]] channels, and external [[chip select]] lines.\n\nThe initial clock rate of the 80186 was 6&nbsp;[[Megahertz|MHz]], but due to more hardware available for the [[microcode]] to use, especially for address calculation, many individual instructions completed in fewer clock cycles than on an 8086 at the same clock frequency. For instance, the common ''register+immediate'' [[addressing mode]] was significantly faster than on the 8086,{{efn|In fact, all variants, including ''reg+reg'' and ''reg+reg+immediate'' were faster.}} especially when a memory location was both (one of) the operand(s) and the destination. Multiply and divide also showed great improvement, being several times as fast as on the original 8086 and multi-bit shifts were done almost four times as quickly as in the 8086.\n\nA few new instructions were introduced with the 80186 (referred to as the 8086-2 instruction set in some [[datasheet]]s{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}): ''enter''/''leave'' (replacing several instructions when handling stack frames), ''pusha''/''popa'' (push/pop all general registers), ''bound'' (check array index against bounds), and ''ins''/''outs'' (input/output of string). A useful ''immediate'' mode was added for the ''push'', ''imul'', and multi-bit shift instructions. These instructions were also included in the contemporary 80286 and in successor chips.{{efn|The instruction set of the 80286 is a superset of the 80186's, plus new instructions for [[protected mode]].}}\n\n[[File:Intel 80C186 die.JPG|thumb|[[Die (integrated circuit)|Die]] of Intel 80C186.]]\nThe (redesigned) [[CMOS]] version, 80C186, introduced [[Memory refresh|DRAM refresh]], a power-save mode, and a direct interface to the 80C187 floating point numeric [[coprocessor]].

Therefore, to reduce the number of chips required, it included features such as [[clock generator]], [[interrupt controller]], timers, [[wait state]] generator, [[Direct memory access|DMA]] channels, and external [[chip select]] lines.\nWhile the N80188 was compatible with the 8087 numeric co-processor, the 80C188 was not. It did not have the ESC control codes integrated.\n\nThe initial clock rate of the 80188 was 6&nbsp;[[Megahertz|MHz]], but due to more hardware available for the [[microcode]] to use, especially for address calculation, many individual instructions ran faster than on an 8086 at the same clock frequency. For instance, the common ''register+immediate''{{efn|In fact, all variants, including ''reg+reg'' and ''reg+reg+immediate'' were faster.}} [[addressing mode]] was significantly faster than on the 8086, especially when a memory location was both (one of the) operand(s) and the destination. Multiply and divide also showed great improvement, being several times as fast as on the original 8086 and multi-bit shifts were done almost four times as quickly as in the 8086.\n\n===End of life===\nAlong with hundreds of other processor models, Intel discontinued the 80188 processor 30 March 2006, after a life of about 24 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://developer.intel.com/design/pcn/Processors/D0106013.pdf|title=Product Change Notification 106013 - 01|date=May 2, 2006|website=Intel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009060120/http://developer.intel.com/design/pcn/Processors/D0106013.pdf|archive-date=October 9, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cpu-collection.de/?tn=1&l0=cl&l1=80186/188 Intel 80186/80188 images and descriptions at cpu-collection.de]\n* [https://www.datasheetarchive.com/?q=80188 Scan of the Intel 80188 data book] at datasheetarchive.com\n{{Intel processors|discontinued}}\n{{Intel controllers}}\n\n[[Category:Intel microcontrollers]]\n[[Category:Intel x86 microprocessors|80186]]","_bytes":6079,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2023-09-13T20:26:50Z"},"title":"Intel 80188","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}

LLC may offer three types of services:\n* Unacknowledged [[connectionless communication|connectionless mode]] services (mandatory)\n* [[connection-oriented communication|Connection mode]] services (optional)\n* Acknowledged [[connectionless communication|connectionless mode]] services (optional)\n\nConversely, the LLC uses the services of the [[media access control]] (MAC), which is dependent on the specific transmission medium ([[Ethernet]], [[Token Ring]], [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI]], [[802.11]], etc.). Using LLC is compulsory for all [[IEEE 802]] networks with the exception of [[Ethernet]].  It is also used in [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface]] (FDDI) which is not part of the [[IEEE 802]] family.\n\nThe IEEE 802.2 sublayer adds some control information to the message created by the upper layer and passed to the LLC for transmission to another node on the same data link.  The resulting packet is generally referred to as ''LLC [[protocol data unit]] (PDU)'' and the additional information added by the LLC sublayer is the ''LLC HEADER''. The LLC Header consist of ''DSAP'' (''Destination [[Service Access Point]]''), ''SSAP''  (''Source [[Service Access Point]]'') and the ''Control'' field.\n\nThe two 8-bit fields DSAP and SSAP allow multiplexing of various upper layer protocols above LLC. However, many protocols use the [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) extension which allows using [[EtherType]] values to specify the protocol being transported atop IEEE 802.2. It also allows vendors to define their own protocol value spaces.\n\nThe 8 or 16 bit [[HDLC]]-style Control field serves to distinguish communication mode, to specify a specific operation and to facilitate connection control and [[flow control (data)|flow control]] (in connection mode) or [[acknowledgement (data networks)|acknowledgements]] (in acknowledged connectionless mode).\n\n==Operational modes==\nIEEE 802.2 provides two [[connectionless mode transmission|connectionless]] and one connection-oriented operational modes:\n* '''Type 1''' is an unacknowledged connectionless mode for a [[datagram]] service. It allows for sending frames\n** to a single destination ([[Point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] or [[unicast]] transfer),\n** to multiple destinations on the same network ([[multicast]]),\n** or to all stations of the network ([[broadcast]]).\nThe use of multicasts and broadcasts reduces network traffic when the same information needs to be propagated to all stations of the network.  However the Type 1 service provides no guarantees regarding the order of the received frames compared to the order in which they have been sent; the sender does not even get an acknowledgment that the frames have been received.\n* '''Type 2''' is a [[connection-oriented]] operational mode. Sequence numbering ensures that the frames received are guaranteed to be in the order they have been sent, and no frames are lost.\n* '''Type 3''' is an acknowledged [[connectionless mode transmission|connectionless]] service. It supports point-to-point communication only.\n\nEach device conforming to the IEEE 802.2 standard must support service type 1. Each network node is assigned an '''LLC Class''' according to which service types it supports:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"| LLC<br/>Class\n!colspan=\"3\"| Supported Service Types\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| I\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n||\n||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| II\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| III\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n||\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| IV\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n|}\n\n==LLC header==\nAny 802.2 LLC PDU has the following format:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|802.2 LLC Header\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Information\n|-\n!DSAP address\n!SSAP address\n!Control\n|-\n|8 bits\n|8 bits\n|8 or 16 bits\n|multiple of 8 bits\n|}\n\nWhen [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) extension is used, it is located at the start of the Information field:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"3\"|802.2 LLC Header\n!colspan=\"2\"|SNAP extension\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Upper layer data\n|-\n!DSAP\n!SSAP\n!Control\n!OUI\n!Protocol ID\n|-\n|8 bits\n|8 bits\n|8 or 16 bits\n|24 bits\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|16 bits\n|multiple of 8 bits\n|}\n\nThe 802.2 header includes two eight-bit address fields, called '''[[service access point]]s''' (SAP) or collectively LSAP in the OSI terminology:\n*SSAP (Source SAP) is an 8-bit long field that represents the logical address of the network layer entity that has created the message. \n* DSAP (Destination SAP) is an 8-bit long field that represents the logical addresses of the network layer entity intended to receive the message.\n\n===LSAP values===\nAlthough the LSAP fields are 8 bits long, the low-order bit is reserved for special purposes, leaving only 128 values available for most purposes.\n\nThe low-order bit of the DSAP indicates whether it contains an individual or a group address:\n* if the low-order bit is 0, the remaining 7 bits of the DSAP specify an individual address, which refers to a single local service access point (LSAP) to which the packet should be delivered. and\n* if the low-order bit is 1, the remaining 7 bits of the DSAP specify a group address, which refers to a group of LSAPs to which the packet should be delivered.\n\nThe low-order bit of the SSAP indicates whether the packet is a command or response packet:\n* if it's 0, the packet is a command packet, and\n* if it's 1, the packet is a response packet.\nThe remaining 7 bits of the SSAP specify the LSAP (always an individual address) from which the packet was transmitted.\n\nLSAP numbers are globally assigned by the IEEE to uniquely identify well established international standards.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Individual LSAP addresses\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| Value\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Meaning\n|-\n!

Other protocols may use the [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) with IEEE 802.2 which is indicated by the hexadecimal value 0xAA (or 0xAB, if the source of a response) in SSAP and DSAP.  The SNAP extension allows using [[EtherType]] values or private protocol ID spaces in all [[IEEE 802]] networks. It can be used both in datagram and in connection-oriented network services.\n\n[[Ethernet]] ([[IEEE 802.3]]) networks are an exception; the IEEE 802.3x-1997 standard explicitly allowed using of the [[Ethernet II framing]], where the 16-bit field after the MAC addresses does not carry the length of the frame followed by the IEEE 802.2 LLC header, but the [[EtherType]] value followed by the upper layer data. With this framing only datagram services are supported on the [[data link layer]].\n\n=== IPv4, IPX, and 802.2 LLC ===\n\nAlthough [[IPv4]] has been assigned an LSAP value of 6 (0x06) and [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] has been assigned an LSAP value of 152 (0x98), IPv4 is almost never directly encapsulated in 802.2 LLC frames without SNAP headers. Instead, the [[Internet standard]] RFC 1042 is usually used for encapsulating IPv4 traffic in 802.2 LLC frames with SNAP headers on [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI]] and on [[IEEE 802]] networks other than [[Ethernet]].  Ethernet networks typically use [[Ethernet II]] framing with [[EtherType]] 0x800 for IP and 0x806 for ARP.<ref>{{Citation | title = LKML | date = 2011-07-27 | url = https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/7/27/169}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Internetwork Packet Exchange|IPX]] protocol used by Novell [[NetWare]] networks supports an additional [[Ethernet]] frame type, [[Ethernet frame#Novell raw IEEE 802.3|802.3 raw]], ultimately supporting four frame types on Ethernet (802.3 raw, [[Ethernet frame#IEEE 802.2 LLC|802.2 LLC]], [[Ethernet frame#IEEE 802.2 SNAP|802.2 SNAP]], and [[Ethernet frame#Ethernet II|Ethernet II]]) and two frame types on [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI]] and other (non-Ethernet) IEEE 802 networks (802.2 LLC and 802.2 SNAP).\n\nIt is possible to use diverse framings on a single network.
