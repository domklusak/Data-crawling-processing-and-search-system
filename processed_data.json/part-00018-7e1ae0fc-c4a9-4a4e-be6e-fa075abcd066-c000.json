The main difference was a greatly improved hardware implementation. Some aspects of the [[instruction set]] are unusual, most notably the ''[[byte]]'' instructions, which operate on [[bit field]]s of any size from 1 to 36 bits inclusive, according to the general definition of a byte as ''a contiguous sequence of a fixed number of bits''.\n\nThe PDP-10 was found in many university computing facilities and research labs during the 1970s, the most notable being [[Harvard University]]'s Aiken Computation Laboratory, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory#LCS and AI Lab|AI Lab]] and [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory#Project MAC|Project MAC]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]]'s [[Stanford AI Lab|SAIL]], [[Computer Center Corporation]] (CCC), [[ETH]] (ZIR), and [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Its main [[operating system]]s, TOPS-10 and [[TENEX (operating system)|TENEX]], were used to build out the early [[ARPANET]]. For these reasons, the PDP-10 looms large in early [[Hacker culture|hacker folklore]].\n\nProjects to extend the PDP-10 line were eclipsed by the success of the unrelated [[VAX]] [[superminicomputer]], and the cancellation of the PDP-10 line was announced in 1983. According to reports, DEC sold \"about 1500 DECsystem-10s by the end of 1980.\"<ref name=Foonly.MMSmag1980>{{cite magazine|magazine=Mini-Micro Systems\n   |title=Foonly challenges DEC patents with emulator\n   |author=Larry Lettieri |date=November 1980 |pages=15, 17}}</ref>\n\n==Models and technical evolution==\n[[File:KA10 mod end.jpg|thumb|[[Flip Chip (trademark)|Flip Chip]] from a DEC KA10, containing 9 transistors, 1971]]\n[[File:DEC-10 Memory Bus Terminator H866 top view.jpg|thumb|Quick Latch Memory Bus Terminator, used on KI10, 1973]]\n[[File:KL10-backplane.jpg|thumb|KL10 Wire-Wrap CPU Backplane]]\n\nThe original PDP-10 processor is the KA10, introduced in 1968.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/www.computer.museum.uq.edu.au/pdf/DEC-10-HMAA-D%20PDP-10%20KA10%20Central%20Processor%20Maintenance%20Manual%20Volume%20I.pdf|title=PDP10 manual|date=Dec 1968}}</ref> It uses discrete [[transistor]]s packaged in DEC's [[Flip Chip (trademark)|Flip-Chip]] technology, with backplanes [[wire wrap]]ped via a semi-automated manufacturing process.

This was joined in 1975 by the higher-performance KL10 (later faster variants), which is built from [[emitter-coupled logic]] (ECL), [[microprogram]]med, and has [[CPU cache|cache]] memory. The KL10's performance was about 1 megaflops using 36-bit floating point numbers on matrix row reduction. It was slightly faster than the newer [[VAX-11/750]], although more limited in memory.\n\nA smaller, less expensive model, the KS10, was introduced in 1978, using TTL and [[AMD Am2900|Am2901]] [[bit-slice]] components and including the [[PDP-11]] [[Unibus]] to connect peripherals. The KS10 was marketed as the DECSYSTEM-2020, part of the DECSYSTEM-20 range; it was DEC's entry in the [[Distributed computing|distributed processing]] arena, and it was introduced as \"the world's lowest cost mainframe computer system.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gordonbell.azurewebsites.net/digital/timeline/1978-2.htm|title=DECSYSTEM-2020|website=gordonbell.azurewebsites.net}}</ref>\n\n===KA10===\nThe KA10 has a maximum main memory capacity (both virtual and physical) of 256 [[kiloword]]s (equivalent to 1152 [[kilobyte]]s); the minimum main memory required is 16 kilowords. As supplied by DEC, it did not include [[paging]] hardware; [[memory management]] consists of two sets of protection and relocation registers, called ''[[base and bounds]]'' registers. This allows each half of a user's [[address space]] to be limited to a set section of [[main memory]], designated by the base physical address and size. This allows the model of separate read-only shareable code segment (normally the high segment) and [[read-write]] data/[[Stack (data structure)|stack]] segment (normally the low segment) used by [[TOPS-10]]  and later adopted by [[Unix]].

KI10 models include 1060, 1070 and 1077, the latter incorporating two CPUs.\n\n===KL10===\n[[File:PDP-10 1090.jpg|thumb|KL10-DA 1090 [[CPU]] and 6 Memory Modules]]\nThe original KL10 PDP-10 (also marketed as DECsystem-10) models (1080, 1088, etc.) use the original PDP-10 memory bus, with external memory modules. Module in this context meant a cabinet, dimensions roughly (WxHxD) 30 x 75 x 30 in. with a capacity of 32 to 256 kWords of [[magnetic-core memory]]. The processors used in the [[DECSYSTEM-20]] (2040, 2050, 2060, 2065), commonly but incorrectly called \"KL20\", use internal memory, mounted in the same cabinet as the [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. The 10xx models also have different packaging; they come in the original tall PDP-10 cabinets, rather than the short ones used later on for the DECSYSTEM-20.  The differences between the 10xx and 20xx models were primarily which operating system they ran, either TOPS-10 or [[TOPS-20]]. Apart from that, differences are more cosmetic than real; some 10xx systems have \"20-style\" internal memory and I/O, and some 20xx systems have \"10-style\" external memory and an I/O bus.  In particular, all ARPAnet TOPS-20 systems had an I/O bus because the AN20 [[Interface Message Processor|IMP]] interface was an I/O bus device.  Both could run either TOPS-10 or TOPS-20 microcode and thus the corresponding operating system.\n\n====Model B====\nThe later Model B version of the 2060 processors removes the 256 [[binary prefix|kilo]][[Word (data type)|word]] limit on the virtual address space by supporting up to 32 \"sections\" of up to 256 kilowords each, along with substantial changes to the instruction set.  The two versions are effectively different CPUs.  The first operating system that takes advantage of the Model B's capabilities is TOPS-20 release 3, and user mode extended addressing is offered in TOPS-20 release 4.  TOPS-20 versions after release 4.1 only run on a Model B.\n\nTOPS-10 versions 7.02 and 7.03 also use extended addressing when run on a 1090 (or 1091) Model B processor running TOPS-20 microcode.\n\n====MCA25====\nThe final upgrade to the KL10 was the MCA25 upgrade of a 2060 to 2065 (or a 1091 to 1095), which gave some performance increases for programs which run in multiple sections.\n\n====Massbus====\nThe I/O architecture of the 20xx series KL machines is based on a DEC bus design called the [[Massbus]]. While many attributed the success of the PDP-11 to DEC's decision to make the PDP-11 Unibus an open architecture, DEC reverted to prior philosophy with the KL, making Massbus both unique and proprietary. Consequently, there were no aftermarket peripheral manufacturers who made devices for the Massbus, and DEC chose to price their own Massbus devices, notably the RP06 disk drive, at a substantial premium above comparable IBM-compatible devices. [[CompuServe]] for one, designed its own alternative disk controller that could operate on the Massbus, but connect to IBM style 3330 disk subsystems.\n\n====Front-end processors====\n[[File:KL10-front-end.jpg|thumb|KL10 frontend PDP-11/40]]\nThe KL class machines have a PDP-11/40 [[front-end processor]] for system start-up and monitoring. The PDP-11 is booted from a dual-ported RP06 disk drive (or alternatively from an 8\" [[floppy disk]] drive or [[DECtape]]), and then commands can be given to the PDP-11 to start the main processor, which is typically booted from the same RP06 disk drive as the PDP-11. The PDP-11 performs watchdog functions once the main processor is running.\n\nCommunication with IBM mainframes, including [[Remote job entry|Remote Job Entry]] (RJE), was accomplished via a DN61 or DN-64 front-end processor, using a PDP-11/40 or PDP-11/34a.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/usenet/decnet|title=USENET alt.sys.pdp10 postings about PDP-10 front end processors}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/BB-J724A-SM_1980/01/documentation/dn60m.man.html|title=DN60 Maintenance Manual|id=JBS-77-001-02-U|date=October 31, 1978|publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation}}</ref>\n\n===KS10===\n[[File:KS10-open.jpg|thumb|KS10]]\nThe KS10 is a lower-cost PDP-10 built using [[AMD Am2900|AMD 2901]] [[bit-slicing|bit-slice]] chips, with an [[Intel 8080|Intel 8080A]] microprocessor as a control processor.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/KS10/EK-OKS10-TM-002_tech_Sep79.pdf|title=KS10-Based DECSYSTEM-2020 Technical Manual|id=EK-0KS10-TM-002|date=September 1979|edition=Second|publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation}}</ref> The KS10 design was crippled to be a Model A even though most of the necessary data paths needed to support the Model B architecture are present.  This was no doubt intended to [[market segmentation|segment the market]], but it greatly shortened the KS10's product life.\n\nThe KS system uses a similar boot procedure to the KL10. The 8080 control processor loads the microcode from an RM03, RM80, or RP06 disk or magnetic tape and then starts the main processor. The 8080 switches modes after the operating system boots and controls the console and remote diagnostic serial ports.\n\n===Magnetic tape drives===\nTwo models of [[tape drive]]s were supported by the TM10 Magnetic Tape Control subsystem:\n* TU20 Magnetic Tape Transport – 45 ips (inches/second)\n* TU30 Magnetic Tape Transport – 75 ips (inches/second)\n* TU45 Magnetic Tape Transport – 75 ips (inches/second)\nA mix of up to eight of these could be supported, using [[7-track tape|seven-track]] or [[9-track tape|nine-track]] devices. The TU20 and TU30 each came in A (9-track) and B (7-track) versions, and all of the aforementioned tape drives could read/write from/to 200 [[Bits Per Inch|BPI]], 556 BPI and 800 BPI IBM-compatible tapes.\n\nThe TM10 Magtape controller was available in two submodels:\n* TM10A did cycle-stealing to/from PDP-10 memory using the KA10 Arithmetic Processor\n* TM10B accessed PDP-10 memory using a DF10 Data Channel, without \"cycle stealing\" from the KA10 Arithmetic Processor<ref name=HW10.KA10>{{cite book\n|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp10/KA10/DEC_10-HAAB-D_SitePrep_May70.pdf\n|title=PDP-10 Site Preparation Guide \n|publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation |date=May 1970}}</ref>{{rp|49}}\n\n==Instruction set architecture==\nFrom the first PDP-6s to the KL-10 and KS-10, the user-mode [[instruction set architecture]] is largely the same. This section covers that architecture.  The only major change to the architecture is the addition of multi-section extended addressing in the KL-10; extended addressing, which changes the process of generating the effective address of an instruction, is briefly discussed at the end. Generally, the system has 36-bit words and instructions, and 18-bit addresses.\n\n=== Registers ===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%;width:36em;\"\n|-\n|+ DEC PDP-10 registers\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|- \n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>0</sub>\n| style=\"width:120px; text-align:center;\"| . . .\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>7</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>8</sub>\n| style=\"width:120px; text-align:center;\"| . . .\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>3</sup><sub>5</sub>\n| style=\"width:auto; background:white; color:black\" | ''(bit position)''\n|- \n|colspan=\"7\" | '''General registers'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"6\"| <div style=\"display:inline-block; width:12px\">&nbsp;</div> AC0\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 0\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC1\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 1\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC2\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 2\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC3\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 3\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC4\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 4\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC5\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 5\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC6\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 6\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC7\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 7\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC10\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 8\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC11\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 9\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC12\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 10\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC13\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 11\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC14\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 12\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC15\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 13\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC16\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 14\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:right\" colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"3\"| AC17\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''R'''egister 15\n|- \n|colspan=\"7\" | '''Program counter and status flags'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Program Flags\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| '''00000'''\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"3\"| PC\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''P'''rogram '''C'''ounter\n|} \nNote that the bit numbering order is different from some other DEC processors, and many newer processors.\n|}\n\nThere are 16 general-purpose, 36-bit registers.  The right half of these registers (other than register 0) may be used for indexing. A few instructions operate on pairs of registers. The \"PC Word\" register is split in half; the right 18 bits contains the [[program counter]] and the left 13 bits contains the [[status register|processor status flag]]s, with five zeros between the two sections. The condition register bits, which record the results of arithmetic operations (''e.g.'' overflow), can be accessed by only a few instructions.\n\nIn the original KA-10 systems, these registers are simply the first 16 words of [[main memory]]. The \"fast registers\" hardware option implements them as registers in the CPU, still addressable as the first 16 words of memory. Some software takes advantage of this by using the registers as an [[CPU cache|instruction cache]] by loading code into the registers and then jumping to the appropriate address; this is used, for example, in [[Maclisp]] to implement one version of the [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html|title=History of T|first=Olin|last=Shivers|access-date=October 25, 2019|quote=Maclisp on the -10 had used a mark&sweep GC (one version of which famously \"ran in the register set,\" though that is another story)}}</ref> Later models all have registers in the CPU.\n\n=== Supervisor mode ===\nThere are two operational modes, supervisor and user mode. Besides the difference in memory referencing described above, supervisor-mode programs can execute input/output operations.\n\nCommunication from user-mode to supervisor-mode is done through Unimplemented User Operations (UUOs): instructions which are not defined by the hardware, and are trapped by the supervisor. This mechanism is also used to emulate operations which may not have hardware implementations in cheaper models.\n\n=== Data types ===\nThe major datatypes which are directly supported by the architecture are [[two's complement]] 36-bit integer arithmetic (including bitwise operations), 36-bit floating-point, and halfwords. Extended, 72-bit, floating point is supported through special instructions designed to be used in multi-instruction sequences. Byte pointers are supported by special instructions. A word structured as a \"count\" half and a \"pointer\" half facilitates the use of bounded regions of memory, notably [[Stack-based memory allocation|stacks]].\n\n=== Instructions ===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%;width:36em;\"\n|-\n|+ DEC PDP-10 instruction formats\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|- \n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>0</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>2</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>3</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>4</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>5</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>6</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>7</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>8</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>9</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>0</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>3</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>4</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>5</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>6</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>7</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>8</sub>\n| style=\"width:60px; text-align:center;\"| . . .\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>3</sup><sub>5</sub>\n| style=\"width:auto; background:white; color:black\" | ''(bit position)''\n|- \n|colspan=\"20\" | '''General instructions'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"9\"| <div style=\"display:inline-block; width:12px\">&nbsp;</div> Opcode\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"4\"| <div style=\"display:inline-block; width:6px\">&nbsp;</div> Acc #\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"1\"| <div style=\"display:inline-block; width:0px\">&nbsp;</div> I\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"4\"| <div style=\"display:inline-block; width:0px\">&nbsp;</div> Index #\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"17\"| <div style=\"display:inline-block; width:12px\">&nbsp;</div> Memory address\n|- \n|colspan=\"12\" | '''I/O instructions'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"3\"| <div style=\"display:inline-block; width:8px\">&nbsp;</div> 7\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"7\"| <div style=\"display:inline-block; width:12px\">&nbsp;</div> Device #\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"3\"| Opcode\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"1\"| <div style=\"display:inline-block; width:0px\">&nbsp;</div> I\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"4\"| <div style=\"display:inline-block; width:0px\">&nbsp;</div> Index #\n| style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"17\"| <div style=\"display:inline-block; width:12px\">&nbsp;</div> Memory address\n|} \n|}\nInstructions are stored in 36-bit words. There are two formats, general instructions and [[input/output]] instructions.{{sfn|Programming|1970|p=13}}\n\nIn general instructions, the leftmost 9 bits, 0 to 8, contain an instruction [[opcode]]. Many of the possible 512 codes are not defined in the base model machines and are reserved for expansion like the addition of a hardware [[floating point unit]]. Following the opcode in bits 9 to 12 is the number of a register which will be used for the instruction. The input/output instructions all start with bits 0 through 2 being set to 1 (decimal value 7), bits 3 through 9 containing a device number, and 10 through 12 the instruction opcode.{{sfn|Programming|1970|p=13}}\n\nIn both formats, bits 13 through 35 are used to form the \"effective address\", E. Bits 18 through 35 contain a numerical constant address, Y. This address may be modified by adding the 18-bit value in a register, X, the register number indicated in bits 14 to 17. If these are set to zero, no indexing is used, meaning register 0 cannot be used for indexing. Bit 13, I, indicates indirection, meaning the ultimate effective address used by the instruction is not E, but the address stored in memory location E. When using indirection, the data in word E is interpreted in the same way as the layout of the instruction; bits 0 to 12 are ignored, and 13 through 35 form I, X and Y as above.\n\nInstruction execution begins by calculating E. It adds the contents of the given register X (if not 0) to the offset Y; then, if the indirect bit is 1, the value at E is fetched and the effective address calculation is repeated. If I is 1 in the stored value at E in memory, the system will then indirect through that address as well, possibly following many such steps.{{sfn|Programming|1970|p=13}} This process continues until an indirect word with a zero indirect bit is reached. Indirection of this sort was a common feature of processor designs of this era.\n\nIn supervisor mode, addresses correspond directly to physical memory. In user mode, addresses are translated to physical memory. Earlier models give a user process a \"high\" and a \"low\" memory: addresses with a 0 top bit use one base register and those with a 1 use another. Each segment is contiguous.  Later architectures have paged memory access, allowing non-contiguous address spaces. The CPU's general-purpose registers can also be addressed as memory locations 0–15.\n\n====General instructions====\nThere are three main classes of general instructions: arithmetic, logical, and move; conditional jump; conditional skip (which may have side effects). There are also several smaller classes.\n\nThe arithmetic, logical, and move operations include variants which operate immediate-to-register, memory-to-register, register-to-memory, register-and-memory-to-both or memory-to-memory. Since registers may be addressed as part of memory, register-to-register operations are also defined. (Not all variants are useful, though they are well-defined.) For example, the ADD operation has as variants ADDI (add an 18-bit ''I''mmediate constant to a register), ADDM (add register contents to a ''M''emory location), ADDB (add to ''B''oth, that is, add register contents to memory and also put the result in the register). A more elaborate example is HLROM (''H''alf ''L''eft to ''R''ight, ''O''nes to ''M''emory), which takes the Left half of the register contents, places them in the Right half of the memory location, and replaces the left half of the memory location with Ones. Halfword instructions are also used for linked lists: HLRZ is the Lisp CAR operator; HRRZ is CDR.\n\nThe conditional jump operations examine register contents and jump to a given location depending on the result of the comparison. The mnemonics for these instructions all start with JUMP, JUMPA meaning \"jump always\" and JUMP meaning \"jump never\" – as a consequence of the symmetric design of the instruction set, it contains several no-ops such as JUMP. For example, JUMPN A,LOC jumps to the address LOC if the contents of register A is non-zero. There are also conditional jumps based on the processor's condition register using the JRST instruction. On the KA10 and KI10, JRST is faster than JUMPA, so the standard unconditional jump is JRST.\n\nThe conditional skip operations compare register and memory contents and skip the next instruction (which is often an unconditional jump) depending on the result of the comparison. A simple example is CAMN A,LOC which compares the contents of register A with the contents of location LOC and skips the next instruction if they are not equal.  A more elaborate example is TLCE A,LOC (read \"Test Left Complement, skip if Equal\"), which using the contents of LOC as a mask, selects the corresponding bits in the left half of register A. If all those bits are ''E''qual to zero, skip the next instruction; and in any case, replace those bits by their Boolean complement.\n\nSome smaller instruction classes include the shift/rotate instructions and the procedure call instructions. Particularly notable are the stack instructions PUSH and POP, and the corresponding stack call instructions PUSHJ and POPJ. The byte instructions use a special format of indirect word to extract and store arbitrary-sized bit fields, possibly advancing a pointer to the next unit.{{efn|cf. {{section link|Byte addressing|Hybrid systems}}}}\n\n====Input/output instructions====\nThe PDP-10 does not use [[Memory-mapped I/O and port-mapped I/O|memory-mapped devices]], in contrast to the [[PDP-11]] and later DEC machines. A separate set of instructions is used to move data to and from devices defined by a device number in the instruction. Bits 3 to 9 contain the device number, with the 7 bits allowing a total of 128 devices. Instructions allow for the movement of data to and from devices in word-at-a-time (DATAO and DATAI) or block-at-a-time (BLKO, BLKI).{{sfn|Programming|1970|pp=87-88}}\n\nIn block mode, the value pointed to by E is a word in memory that is split in two, the right 18 bits indicate a starting address in memory where the data is located (or written into) and the left 18 bits are a counter. The block instructions increment both values every time they are called, thereby increasing the counter as well as moving to the next location in memory. It then performs a DATAO or DATAI. Finally, it checks the counter side of the value at E, if it is non-zero, it skips the next instruction. If it is zero, it performs the next instruction, normally a JUMP back to the top of the loop.{{sfn|Programming|1970|p=88}} The BLK instructions are effectively small programs that loop over a DATA and increment instructions, but by having this implemented in the processor itself, it avoids the need to repeatedly read the series of instructions from main memory and thus performs the loop much more rapidly.{{sfn|Programming|1970|p=89}}\n\nThe final set of I/O instructions are used to write and read condition codes on the device, CONO and CONI.{{sfn|Programming|1970|p=86}} Additionally, CONSZ will perform a CONI, bitmask the retrieved data against the value in E, and then skip the next instruction if it is zero, used in a fashion similar to the BLK commands. Only the right 18 bits are tested in CONSZ.{{sfn|Programming|1970|p=87}}\n\n===Interrupt handling===\nA second use of the CONO instruction is to set the device's priority level for [[interrupt]] handling. There are three bits in the CONO instruction, 33 through 35, allowing the device to be set to level 0 through 7. Level 1 is the highest, meaning that if two devices raise an interrupt at the same time, the lowest-numbered device will begin processing. Level 0 means \"no interrupts\", so a device set to level 0 will not stop the processor even if it does raise an interrupt.{{sfn|Programming|1970|p=92}}\n\nEach device channel has two memory locations associated with it, one at 40+2N and the other at 41+2N, where N is the channel number. Thus, channel 1 uses locations 42 and 43. When the interrupt is received and accepted, meaning no higher-priority interrupt is already running, the system stops at the next memory read part of the [[instruction cycle]] and instead begins processing at the address stored in the first of those two locations. It is up to the [[interrupt handler]] to turn off the interrupt level when it is complete, which it can do by running a CONO, DATA or BLK instruction.{{sfn|Programming|1970|p=92}}\n\nTwo of the device numbers are set aside for special purposes. Device 0 is the computer's front-panel console; reading that device retrieves the settings of the panel switches while writing lights up the status lamps. Device 4 is the \"priority interrupt\", which can be read using CONI to gain additional information about an interrupt that has occurred.{{sfn|Programming|1970|p=94}}\n\n===Extended addressing===\nIn processors supporting extended addressing, the address space is divided into \"sections\".  An 18-bit address is a \"local address\", containing an offset within a section, and a \"global address\" is 30 bits, divided into a 12-bit section number at the bottom of the left 18 bits and an 18-bit offset within that section in the right 18 bits.  A register can contain either a \"local index\", with an 18-bit unsigned displacement or local address in the right 18 bits, or a \"global index\", with a 30-bit unsigned displacement or global address in the right 30 bits.  An indirect word can either be a \"local indirect word\", with its uppermost bit set, the next 12 bits reserved, and the remaining bits being an indirect bit, a 4-bit register code, and an 18-bit displacement, or a \"global indirect word\", with its uppermost bit clear, the next bit being an indirect bit, the next 4 bits being a register code, and the remaining 30 bits being a displacement.<ref name=referencemanual>{{cite web |title=DECsystem-10/DECSYSTEM-20 Processor Reference Manual|id=AA-H391A-TK, AD-H391A-T1|url=http://www.36bit.org/dec/manual/ad-h391a-t1.pdf |publisher=Digital Equipment Corporation |date=June 1982 |access-date=November 14, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011152807/http://www.36bit.org/dec/manual/ad-h391a-t1.pdf |archive-date=October 11, 2015}}</ref>{{rp|1-26&ndash;1-30}}\n\nThe process of calculating the effective address generates a 12-bit section number and an 18-bit offset within that segment.<ref name=\"referencemanual\"/>{{rp|1-26&ndash;1-30}}\n\n==Software==\n\n===Operating systems===\nThe original PDP-10 [[operating system]] was simply called \"Monitor\", but was later renamed [[TOPS-10]].  Eventually the PDP-10 system itself was renamed the DECsystem-10. Early versions of Monitor and TOPS-10 formed the basis of Stanford's [[WAITS]] operating system and the [[CompuServe]] time-sharing system.\n\nOver time, some PDP-10 operators began running operating systems assembled from major components developed outside DEC. For example, the main Scheduler might come from one university, the Disk Service from another, and so on. The commercial timesharing services such as [[CompuServe]], [[Embarq#History|On-Line Systems, Inc.]] (OLS), and [[Time-sharing#Rapidata as an example|Rapidata]] maintained sophisticated inhouse systems programming groups so that they could modify the operating system as needed for their own businesses without being dependent on DEC or others. There are also strong user communities such as [[DECUS]] through which users can share software that they have developed.\n\n[[BBN Technologies|BBN]] developed their own alternative operating system, [[TENEX (operating system)|TENEX]], which fairly quickly became popular in the research community. DEC later ported TENEX to the KL10, enhanced it considerably, and named it [[TOPS-20]], forming the DECSYSTEM-20 line.\n\n[[MIT]], which had developed CTSS, [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] to run on their [[IBM 709]] (and later a modified [[IBM 7094]] system), also developed ITS, [[Incompatible Timesharing System]]<ref>{{cite web \n|title=A Brief History of Hackerdom: The Early Hackers\n|quote=MIT ... built their own operating system, the fabled ..

Xerox had just bought [[Scientific Data Systems]] (SDS) in 1969, and wanted PARC to use an SDS machine. Instead, a group led by [[Charles P. Thacker]] designed and constructed two PDP-10 clone systems named MAXC (pronounced as Max, in honour of [[Max Palevsky]], who had sold SDS to Xerox) for their own use. MAXC was also a [[backronym]] for Multiple Access Xerox Computer.

CompuServe used these systems as 'hosts', providing access to commercial applications, and the CompuServe Information Service. While the first such systems were bought from DEC, when DEC abandoned the PDP-10 architecture in favor of the [[VAX]], CompuServe and other PDP-10 customers began buying [[plug compatible]] computers from Systems Concepts. {{As of|January 2007}}, CompuServe was operating a small number of PDP-10 architecture machines to perform some billing and routing functions.\n\nThe main power supplies used in the KL-series machines were so inefficient that CompuServe engineers designed a replacement supply that used about half the energy. CompuServe offered to license the design for its KL supply to DEC for free if DEC would promise that any new KL bought by CompuServe would have the more efficient supply installed. DEC declined the offer.\n[[File:MF10-Panel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|MF10 Light Panel with [[LED lamps]]]]\n\nAnother modification made to the PDP-10 by CompuServe engineers was replacing the hundreds of incandescent indicator lamps on the KI10 processor cabinet with LED lamp modules. The cost of conversion was easily offset by cost savings in electricity use, reduced heat, and labor needed to replace burned-out lamps. Digital followed this step all over the world. The picture on the right hand side shows the light panel of the MF10 memory which is contemporary with the KI10 CPU. This item is part of a computer museum, and was populated with LEDs in 2008 for demonstration purposes only. There were no similar banks of indicator lamps on KL and KS processors themselves - only on legacy memory and peripheral devices.\n\n==Cancellation and influence==\nThe PDP-10 was eventually eclipsed by the [[VAX]] [[superminicomputer]] machines (descendants of the [[PDP-11]]) when DEC recognized that the PDP-10 and VAX product lines were competing with each other and decided to concentrate its software development effort on the more profitable VAX.  The PDP-10 product line cancellation was announced in 1983, including cancelling the ongoing [[Jupiter project]] to produce a new high-end PDP-10 processor (despite that project being in good shape at the time of the cancellation) and the Minnow project to produce a desktop PDP-10, which may then have been at the prototyping stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.36bit.org/dec/|title=DEC 36-bit Computers|access-date=April 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216153820/http://www.36bit.org/dec/|archive-date=December 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThis event spelled the doom of [[Incompatible Timesharing System|ITS]] and the technical cultures that had spawned the original [[jargon file]], but by the 1990s it had become something of a badge of honor among old-time hackers to have cut one's teeth on a PDP-10.\n\nThe PDP-10 [[assembly language]] instructions LDB and DPB (load/deposit [[byte]]) live on as functions in the [[programming language]] [[Common Lisp]]. See [[Lisp (programming language)#References|the \"References\" section on the LISP article]].

Most (but not all) machines sold to run TOPS-10 were painted \"Blasi Blue\",<ref name=\"color\">{{cite mailing list|url=https://marc.info/?l=classiccmp&m=116408689817844&w=3|title=Re: dec cabinet paint (and/was \"11/34 done\")|first=Don|last=North|mailing-list=classiccmp|date=November 21, 2006}}</ref> whereas most TOPS-20 machines were painted \"Terracotta\" (often mistakenly called \"Chinese Red\" or orange; the actual name of the color on the paint cans was Terra Cotta<ref name=\"color\"/>).\n\nThere were some significant internal differences between the earlier KL10 Model A processors, used in the earlier DECsystem-10s running on KL10 processors, and the later KL10 Model Bs, used for the DECSYSTEM-20s. Model As used the original PDP-10 memory bus, with external memory modules. The later Model B processors used in the DECSYSTEM-20 used internal memory, mounted in the same cabinet as the [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. The Model As also had different packaging; they came in the original tall PDP-10 cabinets, rather than the short ones used later on for the DECSYSTEM-20.\n\nThe last released implementation of DEC's 36-bit architecture was the single cabinet DECSYSTEM-2020, using a KS10 processor.\n\nThe DECSYSTEM-20 was primarily designed and used as a small mainframe for [[timesharing]]. That is, multiple users would concurrently log on to individual user accounts and share use of the main processor to compile and run applications. Separate disk allocations were maintained for all users by the operating system, and various levels of protection could be maintained by for System, Owner, Group, and World users. A model 2060, for example, could typically host up to 40 to 60 simultaneous users before exhibiting noticeably delayed response time.<!-- Based on the performance of the DEC-2060 running at the University of Texas at Arlington circa 1980–1985 -->\n\n==Remaining machines==\nThe [[Living Computer Museum]] of Seattle, Washington, maintained a 2065 running TOPS-10, which was available to interested parties via SSH upon registration (at no cost) at their website.\n\n==References==\n* {{JargonFile}}\n* [[C.

Initially, the film divided critics due to its controversial subject matter, but audience interest and outstanding box-office returns prompted a major critical re-evaluation.

Marion returns to work, steals $40,000, and sets off to drive to Sam's home in Fairvale, California. She pulls over and falls asleep and is woken up by a police officer the next morning. Her anxious behavior makes him question her motives, and he asks to see her license but lets her go. Marion hurriedly trades her car with Arizona plates for a car with California plates. The trade is all for naught as the officer had been watching the whole time.\n\nShe stops for the night at the Bates Motel, located off the main highway during a heavy rainstorm and hides the stolen money inside a newspaper. Proprietor [[Norman Bates]] descends from a large house overlooking the motel, registers Marion under an alias, and invites her to dine with him. After Norman returns to his house, Marion overhears him arguing with his mother about his wish to dine with Marion. Norman returns, apologizes for his mother's outburst, and  discusses his hobby as a [[taxidermist]], his mother's \"illness\", and how people have a \"private trap\" they want to escape. When Marion suggests that Norman should have his mother institutionalized, he becomes greatly offended and insists there is nothing seriously wrong with her. Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money. As she showers, a shadowy figure appears and stabs her to death.  Norman cleans up the murder scene, putting Marion's body, her belongings, and the hidden cash in her car, and sinks it in a [[swamp]].\n\nMarion's sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] arrives in Fairvale a week later, tells Sam about the theft, and demands to know her whereabouts. He denies knowing anything about her disappearance. A private investigator named Arbogast approaches them, saying that he has been hired to retrieve the money. He stops at the Bates Motel and questions Norman, whose nervous behavior and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. He examines the [[guest register]] and discovers from her handwriting that Marion spent a night in the motel. When Arbogast learns that Marion had spoken to Norman's mother, he asks to speak to her, but Norman refuses to allow it. After he enters the Bates home to search for Norman's mother, the shadowy figure emerges from the bedroom and stabs him to death.\n\nWhen Sam and Lila do not hear back from Arbogast, Sam goes to the motel to look for him. He sees a figure in the house who he assumes is Norman's mother. Lila and Sam alert the local sheriff, who tells them Norman's mother died in a murder–suicide, by [[strychnine poisoning]], ten years earlier. The sheriff suggests that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that something happened to Arbogast, Lila, and Sam drive to the motel. Sam distracts Norman in the office while Lila sneaks into the house. Suspicious, Norman becomes agitated and knocks Sam unconscious. As he goes to the house, Lila hides in the fruit cellar, where she discovers the mother's [[Mummy|mummified]] body. She screams in horror, and Norman, wearing women's clothes and a wig, enters the cellar and tries to stab her. Sam appears and subdues him.\n\nAt the police station, a psychiatrist explains that Norman killed his mother and her lover ten years earlier out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he mummified his mother's corpse and began treating it as if she were still alive. He recreated his mother as an [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]], as jealous and possessive towards Norman as he felt about his mother.

The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and zooms in and out, proved difficult for Leigh because the water splashing in her eyes made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well because he had to manually focus while moving the camera.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|p=73}} Retakes were required for the opening scene because Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|p=55}} Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|p=59}} Lastly, the scene in which \"Mother\" is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane) hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be difficult.

Many are close-ups, including extreme close-ups, except for medium shots in the shower directly before and directly after the murder. The combination of the close shots with their short duration makes the sequence feel more subjective than if the images were presented alone or in a wider angle, an example of the technique Hitchcock described as \"transferring the menace from the screen into the mind of the audience\".<ref>Hitchcock, cited in {{Harvnb|Schickel|Capra|2001|pp=293, 308}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Psycho (1960 film) shower scene.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A silhouetted figure brandishes a knife towards the camera|The shadowy figure from the shower scene]]\nTo capture the straight-on shot of the shower head, the camera had to be equipped with a long lens.

When interviewing Hitchcock in 1967, [[François Truffaut]] asked about the extent of Bass's contribution, to which Hitchcock replied that in addition to the titles, Bass had provided storyboards for the Arbogast murder (which he claimed to have rejected), but made no mention of Bass's having provided storyboards for the shower scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notcoming.com/saulbass/caps_psycho.php|title=Psycho: The Title Credits|access-date=November 20, 2010|archive-date=November 26, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126164244/http://notcoming.com/saulbass/caps_psycho.php|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Bill Krohn's ''Hitchcock At Work'', Bass's first claim to have directed the scene was in 1970, when he provided a magazine with 48 drawings used as storyboards as proof of his contribution.<ref name=\"Krohn\">{{Harvnb|Krohn|2003}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Krohn's analysis of the production, while rebutting Bass's claims for having directed the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene—most notably, the fact that the killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn off its hooks, and the transition from the drain to Marion Crane's dead eye. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref name=\"Krohn\" /> Krohn also notes that Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a [[Mitchell Camera|BNC Mitchell]], the other a handheld French ''[[Eclair (camera)|Éclair]]'' camera which [[Orson Welles]] had used in ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a [[Moviola]] on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor [[George Tomasini]] worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass's storyboards.<ref name=\"Krohn\" />\n\nAccording to [[Donald Spoto]] in ''The Dark Side of Genius'' and to Stephen Rebello in ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho'', Hitchcock's wife and trusted collaborator, [[Alma Reville]], spotted a blooper in one of the last edits of ''Psycho'' before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink. According to [[Patricia Hitchcock]], talking in [[Laurent Bouzereau]]'s \"making of\" documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh's character appeared to take a breath. In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences.<ref name=\"dvddoc\" /> Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimatization to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|pp=176, 42}}\n\nIt is often claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the shower scene never once shows a knife puncturing flesh.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|p=169}}<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |via=[[RogerEbert.com]] |date=December 6, 1998 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023 |access-date=December 1, 2006 |archive-date=October 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030120730/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19981206%2FREVIEWS08%2F401010353%2F1023 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Harmetz |first=Aljean |title=Janet Leigh, 77, Shower Taker of 'Psycho', Is Dead |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 5, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/05/movies/05leigh.html?ex=1254715200&en=596717cddaea56ef&ei=5090 |access-date=December 1, 2006 |author-link=Aljean Harmetz |archive-date=December 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205081820/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/05/movies/05leigh.html?ex=1254715200&en=596717cddaea56ef&ei=5090 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, a frame by frame analysis of the sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh's abdomen, but the effect was created by lighting and reverse motion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/blog/?p=274 |title=8 frames of \"Psycho\" |date=May 8, 2008 |work=hitchcockwiki.com |access-date=April 24, 2010  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409193048/http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/blog/?p=274 |archive-date=April 9, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it, that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock all the doors and windows and would leave the bathroom and shower door open.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|p=131}} She never realized until she first watched the film \"how vulnerable and defenseless one is\".<ref name=\"dvddoc\" />\n\nBefore production, Leigh and Hitchcock fully discussed what the scene meant:\n{{Blockquote\n|text=Marion had decided to go back to Phoenix, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the bathtub it was as if she were stepping into the baptismal waters.

Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, and those who had not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|p=112}} The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Because board members did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|p=112}}\n\nAnother cause of concern for the censors was that Marion was shown flushing a toilet, with its contents (torn-up note paper) fully visible.

In the United Kingdom, the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) required cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was seen as disgusting. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|pp=105–106}} In Ireland, censor Gerry O'Hara banned it upon his initial viewing in 1960. The next year, a highly edited version missing some 47 feet of film was submitted to the Irish censor. O'Hara ultimately requested that an additional seven cuts be made: the line where Marion tells Sam to put his shoes on (which implied that he earlier had his pants or trousers off), two shots of Norman spying on Marion through the hole in the wall, Marion's undressing, the shots of Marion's blood flowing down the shower, the shots of Norman washing his hands when blood is visible, repeated incidents of stabbings (\"One stab is surely enough\", wrote O'Hara), the words \"in bed\" from the sheriff's wife's line, \"Norman found them dead together in bed\", and Arbogast's questions to Norman about whether he spent the night with Marion.<ref>Kevin Rockett, ''Irish Film Censorship: A Cultural Journey from Silent Cinema to Internet Pornography'' (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2004), 171-3.</ref> In 1986, the uncut version of ''Psycho'' was accepted by the BBFC, who classified it at 15.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/education/case-studies/psycho | title=Psycho | date=August 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, [[Universal Pictures]] released the uncut version of the film on Blu-ray for the first time.\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released on June 16, 1960, at the [[Columbia Theatre (New York City)|DeMille Theatre]] and the Baronet Theatre in New York City.<ref name=AFI /><ref name=nytrev /> It was the first film sold in the US on the basis that no one would be admitted to the theater after the film had started.<ref>{{cite magazine|title='Psycho' Film Review|url=https://variety.com/1960/film/reviews/psycho-1200419814/|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=6|last=Arneel|first=Gene|access-date=June 15, 2020|date=June 22, 1960|archive-date=June 17, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617191735/https://variety.com/1960/film/reviews/psycho-1200419814/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=playoff>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Gotham Playoff Revolution|date=August 10, 1960|page=13|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety219-1960-08#page/n76/mode/1up|access-date=February 8, 2021|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock's \"no late admission\" policy for the film was unusual for the time.

The trailer was made after completion of the film, and because Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had [[Vera Miles]] don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Because the title ''Psycho'' instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years.

2022}}</ref>\n\n[[American Film Institute]] has included ''Psycho'' in these lists:\n* [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]] – #18\n* [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Thrills]] – #1\n* [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100

100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]] – #14\n\n== Themes and style ==\n=== Subversion of romance through irony ===\nIn ''Psycho'', Hitchcock subverts the romantic elements that are seen in most of his work. The film is instead ironic as it presents \"clarity and fulfillment\" of romance. The past is central to the film; the main characters \"struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories\" and ultimately fail.<ref name=\"brill200–201\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=200–201}}</ref> Lesley Brill writes: \"The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness\". The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=223}}</ref> Marion is like [[Persephone]] of [[Greek mythology]], who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living. The myth does not sustain with Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral print like Persephone's flowers, but they are only \"reflected in mirrors, as images of images—twice removed from reality\". In the scene of Marion's death, Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion's lifeless eye, \"like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini's ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption\".<ref name=\"brill234\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=224}}</ref>\n\nMarion is deprived of \"the humble treasures of love, marriage, home and family\", which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among ''Psycho''{{'}}s secondary characters a lack of \"familial warmth and stability\", which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion's sister Lila, in investigating Marion's disappearance, develop an \"increasingly connubial\" relationship, a development that Marion is denied.<ref name=\"brill228\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=228}}</ref> Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has \"an infantile and divided personality\" and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays stuffed birds that are \"frozen in time\" and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past, such as with Marion's suggestion to put his mother \"someplace\" and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past. Brill explains: {{\" '}}Someplace' for Norman is where his delusions of love, home, and family are declared invalid and exposed\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=229}}</ref>\n\nLight and darkness feature prominently in ''Psycho''. The first shot after the [[intertitle]] is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness.<ref name=\"brill225\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=225}}</ref> Bright lights are also \"the ironic equivalent of darkness\" in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, \"the glaring white\" of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.<ref name=\"brill225–256\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=225–226}}</ref>\n\n=== Motifs ===\nThe film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the  end. More subtly, [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlighting]] turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|pp=90–93}}\n\nMirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as a foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|pp=90–93}}\n\nThere are a number of references to birds. Norman's hobby is stuffing birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. (In the novel, Norman's hobby is taxidermy but it is not focused on birds, and Marion is from Dallas, Texas.) Norman comments that she eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, \"stuffing birds\", ''bird'' being British slang for a desirable woman.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Material Image: Art And the Real in Film |last= Peucker |first=Brigitte |year=2007 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-5431-6 |page=167}}</ref> Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original \"stuffed bird\", both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=161}}\n\n=== Psychoanalytic interpretation ===\n''Psycho'' has been called \"the first [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] thriller\".<ref name=\"Kaganski\">{{Harvnb|Kaganski|1997}}</ref> The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. French film critic Serge Kaganski wrote: \"The shower scene is both feared and desired. Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists because Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene\".<ref name=\"Kaganski\" />\n\nIn his documentary ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'', [[Slavoj Žižek]] remarks that Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the three levels of the human mind that are postulated by [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]]: the top floor would be the [[superego]], where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]], where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and the basement would be Bates' [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]]. Žižek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.<ref>{{cite video |people= [[Sophie Fiennes|Fiennes, Sophie]] (director); [[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek, Slavoj]] (writer/narrator) |date = 2006|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0828154|title = The Pervert's Guide to Cinema|medium= documentary |publisher=Amoeba Film}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Madame Tussauds London 00810 Nevit.jpg|thumb|Sign at [[Madame Tussauds]], London]]\n''Psycho'' has become one of the most recognizable films in cinema history, and is arguably Hitchcock's best known film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysterynet.com/hitchcock/silet/|title=Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of a Film Culture|access-date=November 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105001845/http://www.mysterynet.com/hitchcock/silet/|archive-date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmsdefrance.com/FDF_Psycho_1960_rev.html|title=Psycho (1960)|access-date=November 20, 2010|archive-date=June 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608072953/http://filmsdefrance.com/FDF_Psycho_1960_rev.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamza|first1=Aamir|title=How Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho changed the way movies are made|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/english/2018/sep/08/how-alfred-hitchcocks-psycho-changed-the-way-movies-are-made-1869267.html|website=The New Indian Express|date=8 September 2018}}</ref> In his novel, Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic protagonists, then killed them off. This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh's character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking turn of events in 1960.<ref name=\"Psychof\">[http://www.filmsite.org/psyc.html Psycho (1960)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527175653/http://www.filmsite.org/psyc.html |date=May 27, 2007}}.
