It explores the [[illegal drug trade]] from several perspectives: users, enforcers, politicians, and [[Drug trafficking|trafficker]]s. Their stories are edited together throughout the film, although some characters do not meet each other. The film is an adaptation of the 1989 British [[Channel 4]] television series ''[[Traffik]]''. The film stars an international [[ensemble cast]], including [[Don Cheadle]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Michael Douglas]], [[Erika Christensen]], [[Luis Guzmán]], [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Jacob Vargas]], [[Tomas Milian]], [[Topher Grace]], [[James Brolin]], [[Steven Bauer]], and [[Benjamin Bratt]]. It features both English and Spanish-language dialogue.\n\n[[20th Century Fox]], the original financiers of the film, demanded that [[Harrison Ford]] play a leading role and that significant changes to the screenplay be made. Soderbergh refused and proposed the script to other major Hollywood studios; it was rejected because of the three-hour running time and the subject matter—''Traffic'' is more of a [[political film]] than most Hollywood productions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/203|title= ''Traffic'': Border Wars|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |author= Dargis, Manohla |author-link= Manohla Dargis }}</ref> [[Focus Features|USA Films]], however, liked the project from the start and offered the filmmakers more money than Fox. Soderbergh [[Camera operator|operated]] the camera himself and adopted a distinctive [[Color grading|color grade]] for each storyline so that audiences could tell them apart.\n\n''Traffic'' was released in the United States on December 27, 2000, and received critical acclaim for Soderbergh's direction, the film's style, complexity, messages, and the cast's performances (particularly del Toro's). ''Traffic'' earned numerous awards, including four [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] (from five nominations): [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Steven Soderbergh, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for [[Stephen Gaghan]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] for [[Stephen Mirrione]]. It was also a commercial success with a worldwide box-office revenue total of $207.5 million, well above its estimated $46 million budget.\n\nIn 2004, [[USA Network]] ran a [[miniseries]]—also called ''[[Traffic (miniseries)|Traffic]]''—based on the film and the [[Traffik|1989 British television series]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Mexico storyline===\nIn [[Mexico]], police officer Javier Rodriguez and his partner Manolo Sanchez stop a drug transport and arrest the couriers. General Salazar, a high-ranking Mexican official, interrupts their arrest and decides to hire Javier. Salazar instructs him to apprehend Francisco Flores, a hitman for the [[Tijuana Cartel]], headed by the Obregón brothers.\n\nIn Tijuana, under torture, Flores gives Salazar the names of important members of the Obregón cartel, who are arrested. Javier's and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the Obregón brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is a pawn for the [[Juárez Cartel]], the rival of the Obregón brothers. That entire portion of Salazar's anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as he is only wiping out the competition.\n\nSanchez attempts to sell the information of Salazar's true affiliation to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), but Salazar discovers his plot and has him murdered in the desert with Javier being forced to watch; no longer able to handle working for Salazar, Javier arranges a deal with the DEA. In exchange for his testimony, Javier requests electricity in his neighborhood so the youngsters can play baseball at night rather than be tempted by street gangs and crime. Salazar's secrets are revealed, and he is arrested.\n\nJavier explains to the media the widespread corruption in the police force and army. Later, Javier watches as children play baseball at night in their new stadium.\n\n===Wakefield storyline===\nRobert Wakefield, a conservative Ohio judge, is appointed to head the [[President of the United States|President]]'s [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], taking on the title of [[drug czar]]. His predecessor and several influential politicians warn Wakefield that the [[War on Drugs]] is unwinnable. Meanwhile, Robert's teenage daughter, Caroline, an honors student, has been using [[cocaine]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[heroin]]. This develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth introduces her to [[freebasing]]. Caroline, Seth, and Vanessa are all arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs, and they try to dump him anonymously at a hospital. As Robert and his wife Barbara struggle to deal with the problem, of which Barbara has secretly known for over six months.\n\nRobert ends up being caught between his demanding new position and difficult family life. On a visit to Mexico, he is encouraged by Salazar's successful efforts in hurting the Obregón brothers. Returning to Ohio, Robert learns that Caroline has run away to [[Cincinnati]], and no one knows her exact location. She steals from her parents to procure money for drugs.\n\nRobert drags Seth along as he begins to search Cincinnati for his daughter. After a drug dealer who is prostituting Caroline refuses to reveal her whereabouts, Robert breaks into a seedy hotel room. He finds a semi-conscious Caroline in the company of an older man. He breaks down in tears as Seth quietly leaves. Robert returns to Washington, D.C., to give his prepared speech on a \"10-point plan\" to win the war on drugs. Halfway through the speech, he falters. Realizing how futile his project is, he tells the press that the War on Drugs sometimes implies a war even on one's own family members, which he cannot endorse. He then exits the press conference and takes a taxi to the airport. Robert and Barbara attend [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings with their daughter to support her and others.\n\n===Ayala/DEA storyline===\nIn [[San Diego]], an undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] investigation led by Montel Gordon and Ray Castro leads to the arrest of Eduardo Ruiz, a high-stakes dealer posing as a fisherman. Ruiz decides to take the road to immunity by giving up his boss: [[drug lord]] Carl Ayala, the biggest distributor for the Obregón brothers in the United States. Ayala is indicted by a tough prosecutor, hand-selected by Robert Wakefield to send a message to the Mexican drug organizations.\n\nAs the trial against Ayala begins, his pregnant wife Helena learns of her husband's true profession from his associate, Arnie Metzger. Facing the prospect of life imprisonment for her husband and death threats against her only child, Helena decides to hire Francisco Flores to assassinate Eduardo Ruiz; she knows killing Ruiz will effectively end the trial ''[[nolle prosequi]]''. Flores plants a [[car bomb]] on a DEA car in an assassination attempt against Ruiz. Shortly after planting the bomb, Flores is assassinated by a sniper in retaliation for his cooperation with General Salazar. The bomb meant to kill Ruiz instead kills Agent Castro. Gordon and Ruiz survive.\n\nKnowing Ruiz is soon scheduled to testify, Helena makes a deal with drug lord Juan Obregón, who forgives the Ayala family's debt and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, much to the dissatisfaction of Gordon, who is still angry over Castro's death. Ayala eventually deduces that Metzger initially informed on Ruiz. In a bid for power with another drug cartel in Mexico, Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate the Ayala organization's downfall. According to Ayala, Metzger was planning on taking over Ayala's empire completely. Metzger is later visited by two men with guns. Soon after Ayala's release, Gordon bursts into the Ayala home during his homecoming celebration. Bodyguards wrestle him to the ground, but Gordon surreptitiously plants a listening [[Covert listening device|bug]] under Ayala's desk. Gordon is forced from the property, smiling as he walks away.\n\n==Relationship to actual events==\nSome aspects of the plotline are based on actual people and events:\n* The character General Arturo Salazar is closely modeled after Mexican General [[Jesús Gutiérrez Rebollo]], who was secretly on the payroll of [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]], head of the [[Juarez Cartel]].\n* The character Porfirio Madrigal is modeled after Fuentes.\n* The Obregón brothers are modeled after the [[Tijuana Cartel]]'s [[Arellano Félix]] brothers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Traffic, película que podría ser la crítica más severa a la lucha antidrogas de EU |first=Jim |last=Cason |author2=David Brooks |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/01/09/012n1pol.html |work=[[La Jornada]] |language=es |date=2001-03-09 |access-date=2009-02-25 |archive-date=2011-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526033546/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/01/09/012n1pol.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Traffic |first=Ascanio |last=Cavallo |url=http://diario.elmercurio.cl/detalle/index.asp?id={783e7062-aab9-4a26-bffb-c1c3a3142a18} |work=[[El Mercurio]] |language=es |date=2001-03-10 |access-date=2009-02-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Shaw |first=Deborah |title=\"You Are Alright, But...\": Individual and Collective Representations of Mexicans, Latinos, Anglo-Americans and African-Americans in Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic' |journal=[[Quarterly Review of Film and Video]] |volume=22 |pages=211–223 |year=2005 |doi=10.1080/10509200490474339 |s2cid=190712388 |access-date=2009-02-25 |url=http://www.cfa.arizona.edu/mar453/Traffic%20Quarterly%20Review.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722133318/http://www.cfa.arizona.edu/mar453/Traffic%20Quarterly%20Review.htm |archive-date=2011-07-22 }}</ref>\n\nAt one point in the film, an [[El Paso Intelligence Center]] agent tells Robert his position, official in charge of drug control, doesn't exist in Mexico.

Del Toro remembers, \"Can you imagine? You do the whole movie, bust your butt to get it as realistic as possible, and someone dubs your voice? I said, 'No way. Over my dead body.' Steven was like, 'Don't worry. It's not gonna happen.'\"<ref name=\"Daly\" /> The director fought for subtitles for the Mexico scenes, arguing that if the characters did not speak Spanish, the film would have no integrity and would not convincingly portray what he described as the \"impenetrability of another culture\".<ref name=\"Lemons\" />\n\nThe filmmakers went to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) and [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs]] early on with the script; they told them that they were trying to present as detailed and accurate a picture of the current drug war as possible.<ref name=\"Lemons\" /> The DEA and Customs pointed out inaccuracies in the script. In addition, they gave the production team access to the border checkpoint to Mexico, as shown in the film during the scene in which Wakefield and his people talk with border officials. Despite the assistance, the DEA did not try to influence the script's content.<ref name=\"Lemons\" /> Soderbergh said ''Traffic'' had influences from the films of [[Richard Lester]] and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]. He also spent time analyzing ''[[The Battle of Algiers (film)|The Battle of Algiers]]'' and ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'', which, according to the director, had the feeling that the footage was \"caught\" and not staged.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" /> Another inspiration was [[Alan J. Pakula]]'s film ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' because of its ability to tackle serious issues while being entertaining.<ref name=\"Lyman\">{{cite news |title=Follow the Muse: Inspiration to Balance Lofty and Light |first=Rick |last=Lyman |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E3D91530F935A25751C0A9679C8B63&scp=1&sq=%22Follow+the+Muse%22&st=nyt |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-02-16 |access-date=2008-05-26}}</ref> In the opening credits of his film, Soderbergh tried to replicate the typeface from ''All the President's Men'' and the placement on-screen at the bottom left-hand corner. Analyzing this film helped the director deal with the large cast and working in many different locations for ''Traffic''.<ref name=\"Lyman\" />\n\n===Principal photography===\nHalf of the first day's footage came out overexposed and unusable.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> Before the financiers or studio bosses knew about the problem, Soderbergh was already doing reshoots. The insurers made him agree that any further mishaps resulting in additional filming would come from the director's pocket.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> Soderbergh shot in various cities in California, Ohio, and Texas, on a 54-day schedule and came in $2 million under budget.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> The director acted as his cinematographer under the [[pseudonym]] Peter Andrews and operated the camera himself to \"get as close to the movie as I can\" and to eliminate the distance between the actors and himself.<ref>{{cite web|last1=French|first1=Phillip|title=Traffic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,430492,00.html|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=March 29, 2018|date=January 28, 2001|archive-date=April 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418174448/http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,430492,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Hope\" /> Soderbergh drew inspiration from the cinema verite style of [[Ken Loach]]'s films, studying the framing of scenes, the distance of the camera to the actors, lens length, and the tightness of eyelines depending on the position of a character. Soderbergh remembers, \"I noticed that there's a space that's inviolate, that if you get within something, you cross the edge into a more theatrical aesthetic as opposed to a documentary aesthetic\".<ref name=\"Hope\" /> Most of the day was spent shooting because a lot of the film was shot with available light.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n\nFor the hand-held camera footage, Soderbergh used [[Panavision cameras|Panavision Millennium XL]]s that were smaller and lighter than previous cameras and allowed him to move freely.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> He adopted a distinctive look for each to tell the three stories apart. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film and overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feeling.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> Then, he took the entire film through an [[Ektachrome]] step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> He wanted different looks for each story because the audience had to keep track of many characters and absorb a lot of information, and he did not want them to have to figure out which story they were watching.<ref name=\"Lemons\" />\n\nBenicio del Toro had significant input into certain parts of the film; for example, he suggested a more straightforward, concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using.<ref name=\"Lemons\" /> The director cut a scene from the screenplay in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed, and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.<ref name=\"Divine\" />\n\n[[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]], [[Downtown San Diego]] and [[La Jolla]] were utilized as the environment for the film.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Benninger |first=Michael |date=2016-03-01 |title=Hot Shots |url=https://www.pacificsandiego.com/things-to-do/pac-hot-shots-story.html |access-date=2022-12-10 |website=Pacific San Diego |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nThe first cut of ''Traffic'' ran three hours and ten minutes.<ref name=\"Hope\" /> Soderbergh cut it to two hours and twenty minutes. Early on, there were concerns that the film might get an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#X is replaced by NC-17|NC-17]] rating, and he was prepared to release it with that rating, but the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] gave it an R.<ref name=\"Hope\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Box office performance===\n''Traffic'' was given a limited release on December 27, 2000, in four theaters where it grossed {{USD|184,725}} on its opening weekend.

Sikorsky submitted the S-70 design for the [[United States Army]]'s Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the ''YUH-60A'' and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off competition with the [[Boeing Vertol YUH-61]].\n\nNamed after the Native American war leader [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], the UH-60A entered service with the U.S. Army in 1979, to replace the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] as the Army's tactical transport helicopter. This was followed by the fielding of [[electronic warfare]] and [[special operations]] variants of the Black Hawk. Improved UH-60L and UH-60M utility variants have also been developed. Modified versions have also been developed for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]. In addition to U.S. Army use, the UH-60 family has been exported to several nations. Black Hawks have served in combat during conflicts in [[Grenada]], [[Panama]], [[Iraq]], [[Somalia]], the [[Balkans]], [[Afghanistan]], and other areas in the [[Middle East]].\n\n==Development==\n\n===Initial requirement===\nIn the late 1960s, the United States Army began forming requirements for a helicopter to replace the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Iroquois]], and designated the program as the Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS). The Army also initiated the development of a new, common turbine engine for its helicopters that would become the [[General Electric T700]]. Based on experience in Vietnam, the Army required significant performance, survivability and reliability improvements from both UTTAS and the new powerplant.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 8–10.</ref> The Army released its UTTAS request for proposals (RFP) in January 1972.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 11, 39.</ref> The RFP also included air transport requirements. Transport within the [[C-130 Hercules|C-130]] limited the UTTAS cabin height and length.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 39, 42–43.</ref>\n\nThe UTTAS requirements for improved [[Reliability centered maintenance|reliability]], [[survivability]] and lower [[Whole-life cost|life-cycle costs]] resulted in features such as dual-engines with improved [[hot and high]] altitude performance, and a [[modular design]] (reduced maintenance footprint); run-dry [[gearbox]]es; [[Bulletproofing|ballistically tolerant]], redundant subsystems (hydraulic, electrical and [[Aircraft flight control system|flight controls]]); [[Crashworthiness|crashworthy]] crew ([[Vehicle armour#Aircraft|armored]]) and troop seats; [[Oleo strut|dual-stage oleo]] main [[landing gear]]; ballistically tolerant, crashworthy main structure; quieter, more robust [[Helicopter rotor|main]] and [[Tail rotor|tail]] rotor systems; and a [[Self-sealing fuel tank|ballistically tolerant]], crashworthy [[Aircraft fuel system|fuel system]].<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 42–48.</ref>\n\n[[File:UH-60As over Port Salines airport Grenada 1983.JPEG|thumb|left|UH-60A Black Hawks over [[Maurice Bishop International Airport|Port Salinas]] during the [[invasion of Grenada]], 1983. The conflict saw the first use of the UH-60 in combat.]]\nFour prototypes were constructed, with the first YUH-60A flying on 17 October 1974. Prior to the delivery of the prototypes to the US Army, a preliminary evaluation was conducted in November 1975 to ensure the aircraft could be operated safely during all testing.<ref>Leoni 2007, p. 165.</ref> Three of the prototypes were delivered to the Army in March 1976, for evaluation against the rival [[Boeing-Vertol]] design, the [[Boeing-Vertol YUH-61|YUH-61A]], and one was kept by Sikorsky for internal research. The Army selected the UH-60 for production in December 1976. Deliveries of the UH-60A to the Army began in October 1978 and the helicopter entered service in June 1979.<ref name=\"Eden\">Eden, Paul. \"Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk/Seahawk\", ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''. Amber Books, 2004. {{ISBN|1-904687-84-9}}.</ref>\n\n===Upgrades and variations===\nAfter entering service, the helicopter was modified for new missions and roles, including mine laying and medical evacuation. An EH-60 variant was developed to conduct electronic warfare and special operations aviation developed the MH-60 variant to support its missions.<ref>Tomajczyk 2003, pp. 15–29.</ref>\n\nDue to weight increases from the addition of mission equipment and other changes, the Army ordered the improved UH-60L in 1987. The new model incorporated all of the modifications made to the UH-60A fleet as standard design features. The UH-60L also featured more power and lifting capability with upgraded T700-GE-701C engines and an improved gearbox, both from the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|SH-60B Seahawk]].<ref name=\"Leoni p217-8\">Leoni 2007, pp. 217–18.</ref> Its external lift capacity increased by {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig= 2}} up to {{convert |9000|lb|kg |abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.

Soldiers in the field requiring quick resupply have depended on speed bags filled with items airdropped from a UH-60. However, all systems were ad hoc with bags not made to keep objects secure from impacts, so up to half of the airdropped items would be damaged upon hitting the ground. Started in 2011, the ESBS sought to standardize the airdrop resupply method and keep up to 90 percent of supplies intact. The system includes a hands-free reusable linear brake and expendable speed line and a multipurpose cargo bag; when the bag is deployed, the brake applies friction to the rope, slowing it down enough to keep the bag oriented down on the padded base, a [[honeycomb]] and foam kit inside to dissipate energy. The ESBS not only better protects helicopter-dropped supplies, it allows the Black Hawk to fly higher above the ground, {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} up from 10 feet, while travelling {{convert|20|knot|mph km/h}}, limiting exposure to ground fire. Each bag can weigh {{convert|125-200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and up to six can be deployed at once, dropping at {{convert|40-50|ft/s|m/s}}. Since supplies can be delivered more accurately and the system can be automatically released on its own, the ESBS can enable autonomous resupply from unmanned helicopters.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/109286/Adding_new_punch_to_aerial_deliveries/ \"Adding new punch to aerial deliveries\"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012113200/http://www.army.mil/article/109286/Adding_new_punch_to_aerial_deliveries/ |date=12 October 2015}}, Army, 16 August 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/128843/Picatinny__Speed_Bag__resupplies_Soldiers_with_less_equipment_damage/ \"Picatinny 'Speed Bag' resupplies Soldiers with less equipment damage\"] {{Webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151026045822/http://www.army.mil/article/128843/Picatinny__Speed_Bag__resupplies_Soldiers_with_less_equipment_damage/ |date=26 October 2015}}, Army, 25 June 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/150801/The_enhanced_speed_bag_system/ The enhanced speed bag system] {{Webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150919114140/http://www.army.mil/article/150801/The_enhanced_speed_bag_system/ |date=19 September 2015}}, Army, 7 July 2015</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:A U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter assigned to the Colorado Army National Guard flies to perform a water drop while fighting the Black Forest Fire near Colorado Springs, Colo., June 12, 2013 130612-Z-UA373-388.jpg|thumb|A view of a UH-60L cockpit]]\n\nThe UH-60 features four-blade main and tail rotors, and is powered by two [[General Electric T700]] [[turboshaft]] engines.<ref name=Harding/> The main rotor is fully articulated and has [[elastomeric]] bearings in the rotor head.

The helicopter used the company's Matrix technology (software to improve features of autonomous, optionally-piloted VTOL aircraft) to perform autonomous hover and flight operations under the control of an operator using a man-portable Ground Control Station (GCS). The MURAL program is a cooperative effort between Sikorsky, the US Army Aviation Development Directorate (ADD), and the US Army Utility Helicopters Project Office (UH PO). The purpose of creating an optionally-manned Black Hawk is to make the aircraft autonomously carry out resupply missions and expeditionary operations while increasing sorties and maintaining crew rest requirements and leaving pilots to focus more on sensitive operations.<ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sikorsky-achieves-first-flight-of-mannedunmanned-black-398455/ |title= Sikorsky achieves first flight of manned/unmanned Black Hawk |newspaper= FlightGlobal |date= 23 April 2014 |access-date= 23 April 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140426022614/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sikorsky-achieves-first-flight-of-mannedunmanned-black-398455/ |archive-date= 26 April 2014 |url-status= live}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/rotorhub/optionally-piloted-black-hawk-takes/ |title= Optionally Piloted Black Hawk takes off |publisher= Shephard media |date= 23 April 2014 |access-date= 23 April 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150604092300/http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/rotorhub/optionally-piloted-black-hawk-takes/ |archive-date= 4 June 2015 |url-status= dead }}.</ref>\n* '''VH-60D Night Hawk''': VIP-configured HH-60D, used for presidential transport by USMC.

The weapon is manually loaded and positioned, and can be towed by a 2-ton truck or [[High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle]] (HMMWV), can be transported by [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopters, or can be dropped by parachute with airborne units. When emplaced, the howitzer's high volume of fire compensates in large measure for the lower explosive weight of the projectile compared to the Army's 155 mm and 203 mm howitzers. Since 1964, the Army acquired 1,150 M102 towed howitzers. The weapon is being replaced by the [[M119 howitzer|M119]]-series 105&thinsp;mm howitzer.<ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/m102.htm Global Security. Org, M102 105&thinsp;mm Lightweight Towed Howitzer]</ref>\n\n=== Resistance to change ===\nUnits were initially equipped with the [[M101 howitzer|M101A1 howitzer]], virtually the same 105&thinsp;mm howitzer that had been used to support U.S. forces since [[World War II]]. In 1966 a new 105&thinsp;mm towed howitzer, the M102, was received in Vietnam. The first M102s were issued to the 1st Battalion, [[21st Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|21st Field Artillery]], in March 1966.<ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\" /> Replacement of the old howitzers continued steadily over the next four years.\n\nMany of the more seasoned artillerymen did not want the old cannon replaced. Over the years they had become familiar with its every detail and were confident that it would not disappoint them in the clutch. These experienced artillerymen could offer some seemingly convincing reasons why the M101 was still the superior weapon: its waist-high breech made it easier to load; it had higher ground clearance when in tow; but most important, it was considerably less expensive than the M102.<ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\" /> Their arguments, however, were futile.\n\nThe new M102 was substantially lighter, weighing little more than {{convert|1.5|ST}} whereas the M101A1 weighed approximately {{convert|2.5|ST}};<ref name=\"globalsecurity.org\" /> as a result, more ammunition could be carried during heliborne operations, and a 3/4-ton truck rather than a [[M35 2½-ton cargo truck|2½-ton truck]] was its prime mover for ground operations. Another major advantage of the M102 was that it could be traversed a full 6,400 [[Angular mil#Artillery sights|mils]]; the M101A1 had a limited on-carriage traverse, which required its trails (stabilizing legs) to be shifted if further traverse was necessary. The M102 fires the same [[Shell (projectile)#Separate loading cased charge|semi-fixed]] ammunition as the M101, but its longer barrel (32 calibres versus 22 calibres on M101) allows a slightly higher muzzle velocity and thus enhanced firing range.<ref name=\"Christopher Chant\"/> A low silhouette made the new weapon a more difficult target for the enemy, an advantage that far outweighed the disadvantage of being somewhat less convenient to load.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:M1114 towing M102 Howitzer.JPG|thumb|right|M102 howitzer belonging to Battery A, 1-206th FA, is towed north from Camp New York, Kuwait by a M1114 Up-Armored HMMWV.]]\nThe 105&nbsp;mm howitzer M102 is a lightweight towed weapon, which has a very low silhouette when in the firing position. The M102 howitzer fires a {{convert|33|lb|kg|abbr=on}} projectile of semifixed ammunition and at charge 7 it will fire to {{convert|11.5|km|abbr=on}}. It has a muzzle velocity of {{convert|494| m/s|abbr=on}}. The maximum rate of fire is 10 rounds per minute for the first 3 minutes, with a sustained rate of 3 rounds per minute.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">TM 9-100-202-14, TM 9-1015-234-12, TM 9-1015-234-10, AND LO 9-1015-234-10</ref>\n\nA roller tire attached to the trail assembly of the M102 permits the weapon to be rotated 6,400 mils (360 degrees) around a firing platform, which provides the pivot for the weapon. It can be elevated from −89 mils (−5 degrees) to a maximum of 1,333 mils (75 degrees). The panoramic telescope has a four power, fixed focus optical system, with 178 mils (10 degrees) field of view. It contains dry nitrogen gas to retard fogging and condensation. The parallax shield used during boresighting protects the lens.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe trails are made of aluminum alloy. They are a single [[Gun carriage#Modern gun carriages|box trail]] in wishbone shape, and serve three purposes: mobility; stability; and stowage of section equipment. The lunette is the towing pintle that allows the weapon to be connected to the vehicle. When towing, vehicle has a fixed or seized tow pintle; remove the lock plate located under the lunette. The drawbar has two positions: lowered for travel and raised for firing. There are two lifting brackets to connect slings to when the howitzer is being lifted by helicopter. A third bracket is located on front yoke. The carriage handles are used by crew members to lifting and shifting the howitzer during loading, unloading, and emplacing the howitzer.\n\nThe firing platform attaches to the howitzer lower carriage by using a socket and a locking handle. The eight holes are for the stakes needed to stake the howitzer in position. Platform stakes are issued in three sizes. There are four {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} stakes issued for use in frozen or rocky terrain, and are normally issued only where needed, such as extremely cold areas. There are eight {{convert|24|in|cm|abbr=on}} stakes issued, and are used for hard packed ground. Four {{convert|38|in|m|abbr=on}} stakes are issued for use in soft ground.\n\nThe first production versions were displayed with a [[muzzle brake]], most likely to allow long range 105&nbsp;mm rounds to be fired, but was discontinued before shipment to Vietnam.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yykDAAAAMBAJ&dq=popular+science+1930&pg=PA95 \"Howitzer Fires In All Directions.\"] ''Popular Science'', September 1966, p. 95, bottom of page.</ref>\n\n== Current usage ==\n[[File:M102 Howitzer A1206 Tai Iraq 2004.JPG|thumb|left|102 Howitzer belonging to Battery A, 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery, 39th Brigade Combat Team, in position at Camp Taji, Iraq 29 May 2004]]\nWhile the M102 is no longer in active use by the United States Army, having been replaced by the [[M119 howitzer|M119]], it is  still in use by the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]. The M102 was last deployed to combat in 2004 by the [[1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery]], [[Arkansas Army National Guard]].  Seventeen M102 howitzers were deployed to [[Camp Taji]], Iraq. The 1-206th FA provided fire and conducted counter-fire missions in support of [[39th BCT]] operations, an element of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]]. The 1-206th scavenged spare parts from nine M102 howitzers that were located in the Camp Taji Boneyard.  These howitzers were allegedly captured by the [[Iraqi Army]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in the 1980s.\n\nThe M102 is also used on the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Lockheed AC-130]] gunship. The M102 105&thinsp;mm cannon was modified to be fired from the left rear side door of the AC-130. To accommodate the cannon, the rear side-firing 40&thinsp;mm guns were replaced by the radome that formerly had been installed in the door cavity. That change provided enough space for the 105&thinsp;mm gun to be mounted in the doorway in place of the radome. The gun was first used in the later stages of the Vietnam War.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/equip/m102.htm|title = M102 105mm Cannon}}</ref> The latest AC-130J Ghostrider gunship was not originally planned to include the 105&thinsp;mm, but designed with enough spare power and room to mount it at some later point.  The Air Force decided to include it in January 2015, starting installation on the third aircraft, then having the first two be retrofitted when guns become available; M102s will be pulled off retiring AC-130Us and put into the AC-130Js.<ref>[http://breakingdefense.com/2015/01/ghostriders-big-gun-ac-130j-gets-105-asap-laser-later/ Ghostrider’s Big Gun: AC-130J Gets 105 ASAP; Laser Later] – Breakingdefense.com, 27 January 2015</ref>\n\nThe M102 is used in extremely limited roles by the [[United States Marine Corps]], primarily for firing salutes.\n\nThe [[Malaysian Army]] used the M102 during Malaysia's [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968–89)|second communist insurgency]] (1968–1988) to bombard [[Malayan Communist Party|insurgent]] positions on the [[Malaysia-Thailand border]]. The guns were transported by helicopter to remote firing positions. All Malaysian M102s have now been decommissioned and are only used for firing salute.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:M102 plate.JPG|thumb|right|Data plate on an M102 Howitzer]]\n* Caliber: 105&thinsp;mm (4.13&thinsp;in)\n* Length: 21.8 feet (6.4 m)\n* Barrel Length: 32 calibres<ref name=\"Christopher Chant\"/>\n* Width: 6.4 feet (2&thinsp;m)\n* Height: 5.2 feet (1.6 m)\n* Weight: 1.5 tons (1.4 t)\n* Crew: 8\n* Rate of fire: 10 rounds per minute maximum, 3 rounds per minute sustained\n* Range: 11,500&nbsp;m (7.1 miles), 15,100&thinsp;m (9.4 miles) with rocket-assisted projectile\n\n== Operators ==\n[[File:U.S. Army artillerymen in Grenada, 1983.jpg|thumb|U.S. [[82nd Airborne Division]] firing an M102 howitzer in [[Operation Urgent Fury|Grenada]], 1983]]\n[[File:Quasqueton Veterans Memorial.JPG|thumb|right|[[Quasqueton, Iowa]] Veterans' Memorial with M102 on display]]\n* {{flag|Brazil}} 19\n* {{flag|El Salvador}} 24\n* {{flag|Jordan}} 50\n* {{flag|Lebanon}} 18<ref>[http://armstrade.sipri.org/arms_trade/trade_register.php SIPRI Arms Transfers Database]</ref>\n* {{flag|Malaysia}} 40<ref name=\"SIPRI\">{{cite web|url=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php|title=SIPRI arms transfer database|date=17 June 2011|publisher=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]|access-date=17 June 2011}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Oman}} 36\n* {{flag|Philippines}} 24\n* {{flag|Saudi Arabia}} 140\n* {{flag|Turkey}}\n* {{flag|Thailand}} 12\n* {{flag|United States}} – [[Lockheed AC-130#Armament|AC-130 gunship]]\n* {{flag|Uruguay}} 15\n*{{flag|Vietnam}} Captured from [[Vietnam War]]\n\n===Former operators===\n* {{flag|Khmer Republic}}\n* {{flag|South Vietnam}} – unknown number used by the [[Republic of Vietnam Airborne Division]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[M101 howitzer]] – previous American 105&thinsp;mm towed howitzer\n* [[M119 howitzer]] – current towed 105&thinsp;mm howitzer in US Army service\n* [[List of artillery]]\n* [[List of crew served weapons of the US Armed Forces]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|M102 105 mm howitzer}}\n* [http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/indirect/m102.html The Army Fact File]\n* {{Internet Archive short film|id=gov.dod.dimoc.26968|name=STAFF FILM REPORT 66-19A (1966)}}\n\n{{USAF weapons}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Cold War artillery of the United States]]\n[[Category:Artillery of the United States]]\n[[Category:Aircraft artillery]]\n[[Category:Field artillery of the Cold War]]\n[[Category:105 mm artillery]]\n[[Category:Military equipment introduced in the 1960s]]","_bytes":13818,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2023-09-08T08:58:28Z"},"title":"M102 howitzer","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}

howitzer|M44]]. It has been upgraded a number of times, most recently to the '''M109A7'''. The M109 family is the most common [[Western world|Western]] [[indirect-fire]] support weapon of maneuver brigades of armored and mechanized infantry divisions.\n\nThe M109 has a crew of four: the section chief/commander, the driver, the gunner, and the ammunition handler/loader. The chief or gunner aims the cannon left or right (deflection) and up and down (quadrant).\n\nThe [[British Army]] replaced its M109s with the [[AS-90]]. Several European armed forces have or are currently replacing older M109s with the German [[Panzerhaubitze 2000|PzH 2000]]. Upgrades to the M109 were introduced by the U.S. (see [[#types|variants]]) and by Switzerland (KAWEST). With the cancellation of the U.S. [[XM2001 Crusader|Crusader]] and [[Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon]], the M109A6 (\"Paladin\") will likely remain the principal self-propelled howitzer for the U.S. until the new [[M1299 howitzer|M1299]] enters service.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Dutch M109 155 mm Self-propelled Howitzer Right Side.jpg|thumb|left|Early M109 howitzer of the [[Royal Netherlands Army]].]]\n\nThe M109 was the medium variant of a U.S. program to adopt a common [[chassis]] for its self-propelled artillery units. The light version, the [[M108 Howitzer]], was phased out during the [[Vietnam War]], but many were rebuilt as M109s.\n\nThe M109 saw its combat debut in Vietnam. Around 200 vehicles were deployed in 1966, but the entire fleet suffered a mechanical malfunction within a year of operation. The U.S. dispatched engineers and mechanics, but all M109s were recalled back to the U.S. in 1967 after failing to repair in the field.

In the 1960s, the [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean Army]] received [[M107 self-propelled gun|M107]] and [[M110 howitzer|M110]] from the United States. However, the number of these self-propelled guns was insufficient to counter rapidly-growing North Korean artillery capabilities. In the 1970s, South Korea began mass-producing towed howitzers locally, but intelligence reports of North Korean [[M-1978 Koksan|170 mm self-propelled artillery]] forced South Korea to look for a new self-propelled artillery system.<ref name=\"K55 interview\"/>\n\nIn December 1983, the ministers of defense of the United States and South Korea signed a MOU to co-produce M109A2 in South Korea using American technical data. The United States delivered two completed M109A2s to South Korea for operational review, and the [[Agency for Defense Development]] began to translate the data package and created field and maintenance manuals for soldiers. South Korea wanted to produce every part of the vehicle domestically; however, due to the amendment bill by Rep. [[Samuel S. Stratton]] of New York, which established a limit for foreign military technology cooperation, the turret and the M185 cannon from [[Watervliet Arsenal]] were imported from the United States.<ref name=\"K55 interview\"/>\n\nCompared to the M109A2, besides 63 percent of parts being produced locally, K55 has a driver's night periscope and light exposure minimization device to enhance night-time operations as well as additional radio systems.

This includes increased armor, a redesigned internal arrangement for safer ammunition and equipment storage, engine and suspension upgrades, and improvement of the M284 Cannon and M182A1 Mount. The greatest difference is the integration of an inertial navigation system, sensors detecting the weapons' lay, automation, and an encrypted digital communication system, which utilizes computer controlled frequency-hopping to avoid enemy [[electronic warfare]] and allow the howitzer to send grid location and altitude to the battery [[fire direction center|Fire Direction Center (FDC)]]. \n\nThe battery FDCs coordinates fire through a battalion or higher FDC. This allows the Paladin to halt from the move and fire within 30 seconds, with an accuracy equivalent to the previous models when properly emplaced, laid, and safed—a process that previously required several minutes under the best of circumstances. Tactically, this improves the system's survivability by allowing the battery to operate dispersed in pairs across the countryside, and allowing the howitzer to quickly move between salvos, or if attacked by indirect fire, aircraft, or ground forces.\n\nAmmunition storage of 155&nbsp;mm rounds was increased from 36 to 39.\n\nThe US Army received the first Paladin in 1994 and the last of 950 in 1999.{{citation needed|reason=Military Balance 2022 lists 500+ in service + 800+ in store|date=October 2022}}\n\n===M109 \"KAWEST\"===\n{{See also|M109 in the Swiss Armed Forces}}[[File:M109kawest.JPG|thumb|A Swiss M109 KAWEST howitzer in 2009]]\nThis Swiss improved version produced by [[RUAG]] incorporates a new Swiss-designed L47 155&nbsp;mm gun with an increased firing range of up to 36&nbsp;km.

Before its retirement from US service, it was the largest available [[Self-propelled artillery|self-propelled]] [[howitzer]] in the [[United States Army]]'s inventory; it continues in service with the armed forces of other countries, to which it was exported.<!--see Operators section--> Missions include general support, [[counter-battery fire]], and [[suppression of enemy air defense]] systems.\n\n==Description==\nAccording to the operator's manual, the M110's typical rate of fire was three rounds per two minutes when operated at maximum speed, and one round per two minutes with sustained fire. The M110 featured a hydraulically operated rammer to automatically chamber the {{convert|200|lb|abbr=on}}+ projectile. These rammers were prone to breakdown and generally slowed operation of the gun because the rammers required crews to completely lower the massive barrel before using it. Well trained and motivated crews could achieve two to four rounds per minute for short periods by using the manual rammer, essentially a heavy steel pole with a hard rubber pad on one end. Using the manual rammer was physically demanding, but crews were not required to lower the barrels as much as with the hydraulic rammer.\n\nThe M110's range varied from {{convert|16.8|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip}} to approximately {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip}} when firing standard projectiles, and up to {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip}} when firing rocket-assisted projectiles.<ref name=mtart>{{cite news |url=http://www.military-today.com/artillery/m110.htm |title=The M110 at Military-today.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe M110 howitzer first entered service with the U.S. Army in 1963 and was used in the [[Vietnam War]] by the [[United States Army]]. Later versions were used in the [[Gulf War]] - [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]] and [[Operation Desert Storm]] by Tango Battery [[5th Battalion 11th Marines]], and the [[British Army]]'s [[32nd Regiment Royal Artillery]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJfcVG8mu_s 32 Regiment RA in action - Gulf War 1991]</ref>\n\nIn 1977 the upgraded M110A1 entered service, featuring a longer M201 series barrel which gave an increased range. The M110A2 is the latest version with a double [[muzzle brake]], in contrast to the earlier A1 version which had a plain muzzle. The 2nd Battalion 18th Field Artillery (U.S. Army) which inactivated in 1994 at [[Fort Sill]], Oklahoma, and the 5th Battalion 18th Field Artillery served in Desert Storm with the M110A2 Howitzer, as well as the 142nd Field Artillery Brigade ([[Arkansas Army National Guard]]), and 1st BN 181 Field Artillery ([[Tennessee Army National Guard]]). Most of the U.S. Army and USMC relied on the [[M109 howitzer|M109 series 155-millimeter howitzer gun]] systems during this conflict; sending remaining M110s to reserve or National Guard units. These units then took possession of M109s as they returned from service in the Gulf. M110s were still in service with the 3/92 FA (USAR) and running fire missions at [[Camp Atterbury]] as late as the summer of 1994.<ref name=\"youtube-gulf-war-1991\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJfcVG8mu_s UK M110 Artillery in action Gulf War 1991]</ref>\n\nThe howitzer has been retired from U.S. Army service having been replaced by the [[M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System]].\n\nThe M110A2s were made from refitted M110s or [[M107 self-propelled gun|M107 175&nbsp;mm SP guns]]<ref>(Hunnicutt).</ref>\n\n[[File:Dutch M110 203 mm Howitzer in Firing Position 1972.jpg|thumb|left|Dutch artillerymen with their M110 in firing position, 1972]]\n\nAt the end of the Cold War under U.S. Division Plan 86, all armored and [[mechanized infantry]] divisions included a battalion of heavy artillery that included two batteries of M110A2 SP howitzers with six guns each for a total of 12 guns, plus one battery of nine [[M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System]] rocket artillery.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIsrael used M110s along with M107s during [[Yom Kippur War]] against Egyptian and Syrian forces.

It can be equipped with a variety of warheads, and in more recent versions, guidance systems for point attacks. The Hydra is widely used by US and allied forces, competing with the Canadian [[CRV7]], with which it is physically interchangeable.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Hydra 70 is derived from the {{convert|2.75|in|mm|abbr=out|adj=on}} diameter Mk 4/Mk 40 [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket]] developed by the [[United States Navy]] for use as a free-flight aerial [[rocket (weapon)|rocket]] in the late 1940s. The Mk&nbsp;40 was used during the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] wars to provide close air support to ground forces from about 20 different firing platforms, both fixed-wing and armed helicopters.\n\nThe main change made to produce the Hydra was the Mk. 66 motor which uses a new propellant that offers considerably more thrust, {{Convert|1335|lbf}} (Mod 2/3) {{Convert|1415|lbf}} (Mod 4). The fins of the Mk 40 flipped forward from the rear when the rocket left the launching tube, but in the Hydra they are curved to match the outside diameter of the rocket fuselage and flip sideways to open, which is referred to as WAFAR (Wrap-Around Fin Aerial Rocket) instead of FFAR (folding-fin aerial rocket). To improve stability during the time the fins are still opening, the four motor nozzles have a slight cant angle to impart a spin while the rocket is still in the launch tube.\n\nToday, the OH-58D(R) Kiowa Warrior and AH-64E Apache Longbow, as well as the Marine Corps' versatile UH-1 Huey and AH-1 Cobra, carry the Hydra rocket launcher standard on its weapon pylons.<ref>{{citation |chapter-url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/hydra-70.htm |publisher=Global Security |series=Military |title=Munitions |chapter=Hydra 70}}.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{citation |publisher=GDATP |url=http://www.gdatp.com/files/PDF/A064_Hydra-70.pdf |title=Hydra 70 |access-date=6 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704231453/http://www.gdatp.com/files/PDF/A064_Hydra-70.pdf |archive-date=4 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}.</ref>\n\n===Mk 66 rocket motor variants===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:96%;\"\n! style=\"width: 7em;\" | Designation\n!

The war reserve unitary and cargo warheads are used for anti-[[materiel]], [[anti-personnel]], and suppression missions. The Hydra 70 family of folding-fin aerial rockets also includes smoke screening, illumination, and training [[warhead]]s. Hydra 70 rockets are known mainly by either their warhead type or by the [[rocket motor]] designation, Mk 66 in US military service.\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], Hydra 70 rockets are fired from the [[AH-64 Apache]] and AH-64D Apache Longbow [[helicopter]] variants using M261 19-tube rocket launchers, and the [[OH-58D Kiowa Warrior]] using seven-tube M260 rocket launchers. In the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], either the M260 or M261 launchers are employed on the [[AH-1W SuperCobra]] and [[AH-1Z Viper]], depending upon the mission. The M260 and M261 are used with the Mk 66 series of rocket motor, which replaced the Mk 40 series. The Mk 66 has a reduced system weight and provides a remote [[fuze]] setting interface. Hydra 70s have also been fired from [[UH-60]] and [[AH-6]] series aircraft in US Army service.\n\nThe [[AH-1 Cobra|AH-1G Cobra]] and the [[UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B \"Huey\"]] used a variety of launchers including the M158 seven-tube and M200 19-tube rocket launchers designed for the Mk 40 rocket motor; however, these models have been replaced by upgraded variants in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] because they were not compatible with the Mk 66 rocket motor. The Hydra 70 rocket system is also used by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], and the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].\n\n===Common U.S. Mk 66 compatible launchers===\n[[File:Hydra 70 M261.jpeg|thumb|Dummy Hydra 70s in an M261 launcher on a Dutch [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|AH-64 Apache]]. The tips of some of the rockets are white (and the rockets are shorter in length, and they are attached to the launcher via umbilical connectors) because they have a different type of warhead and fuze.]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:96%;\"\n!

This [[space exploration]] project was conducted by the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] in California. The space probe was manufactured by [[TRW Inc.]]\n\n''Pioneer 10'' was assembled around a hexagonal [[satellite bus|bus]] with a {{convert|2.74|m|sp=us|adj=on}} diameter parabolic dish [[Directional antenna|high-gain antenna]], and the spacecraft was [[Spin-stabilisation|spin stabilized]] around the axis of the antenna. Its [[electric power]] was supplied by four [[radioisotope thermoelectric generators]] that provided a combined 155 watts at launch.\n\nIt was launched on March 3, 1972, at 01:49:00 UTC (March 2 local time), by an [[Atlas-Centaur]] [[expendable launch system|expendable vehicle]] from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 36|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]]. Between July 15, 1972, and February 15, 1973, it became the first spacecraft to traverse the [[asteroid belt#Exploration|asteroid belt]]. Photography of Jupiter began November 6, 1973, at a range of {{convert|25,000,000|km|sp=us}}, and about 500 images were transmitted. The closest approach to the planet was on December 3, 1973, at a range of {{convert|132,252|km|sp=us}}. During the mission, the on-board instruments were used to study the asteroid belt, the environment around Jupiter, the [[solar wind]], [[cosmic ray]]s, and eventually the far reaches of the Solar System and [[heliosphere]].<ref name=\"PionOdys\" />\n\n[[Radio communications]] were lost with ''Pioneer 10'' on January 23, 2003, because of the loss of electric power for its [[radio transmitter]], with the probe at a distance of {{convert|12|e9km|lk=out|sp=us}} from Earth.\n\n==Mission background==\n\n===History===\nIn the 1960s, American aerospace engineer [[Gary Flandro]] of the NASA [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] conceived of a mission, known as the [[Planetary Grand Tour]], that would exploit a rare alignment of the outer planets of the Solar System. This mission would ultimately be accomplished in the late 1970s by the two [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes, but in order to prepare for it, NASA decided in 1964 to experiment with launching a pair of probes to the [[outer Solar System]].{{sfn|Launius|2004|p=36}} An advocacy group named the Outer Space Panel and chaired by American space scientist [[James A. Van Allen]], worked out the scientific rationale for exploring the outer planets.{{sfn|Van Allen|2001|p=155}}{{sfn|Burrows|1990|pp=16}} NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center|Goddard]] Spaceflight Center put together a proposal for a pair of \"Galactic Jupiter Probes\" that would pass through the asteroid belt and visit Jupiter. These were to be launched in 1972 and 1973 during favorable windows that occurred only a few weeks every 13 months. Launch during other time intervals would have been more costly in terms of propellant requirements.{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}}\n\nApproved by NASA in February 1969,{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}} the twin spacecraft were designated Pioneer F and Pioneer G before launch; later, they were named ''Pioneer 10'' and ''[[Pioneer 11]]''. They formed part of the [[Pioneer program]],{{sfn|Burgess|1982|p=16}} a series of United States uncrewed space missions launched between 1958 and 1978. This model was the first in the series to be designed for exploring the outer Solar System. Based on proposals issued throughout the 1960s, the early mission objectives were to explore the interplanetary medium past the orbit of Mars, study the asteroid belt and assess the possible hazard to spacecraft traveling through the belt, and explore Jupiter and its environment.<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/> Later development-stage objectives included the probe closely approaching Jupiter to provide data on the effect the environmental radiation surrounding Jupiter would have on the spacecraft instruments.\n\nMore than 150 scientific experiments were proposed for the missions.{{sfn|Simpson|2001|p=144}} The experiments to be carried on the spacecraft were selected in a series of planning sessions during the 1960s, then were finalized by early 1970. These would be to perform imaging and [[polarimetry]] of Jupiter and several of its satellites, make infrared and ultraviolet observations of Jupiter, detect asteroids and meteoroids, determine the composition of charged particles, and to measure magnetic fields, plasma, cosmic rays and the [[zodiacal light]].<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/> Observation of the spacecraft communications as it passed behind Jupiter would allow measurements of the planetary atmosphere, while tracking data would improve estimates of the mass of Jupiter and its moons.<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/>\n\n[[NASA Ames Research Center]], rather than Goddard, was selected to manage the project as part of the Pioneer program.{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}} The Ames Research Center, under the direction of Charles F. Hall, was chosen because of its previous experience with spin-stabilized spacecraft. The requirements called for a small, lightweight spacecraft which was magnetically clean and which could perform an interplanetary mission. It was to use spacecraft modules that had already been proven in the ''Pioneer 6'' through ''9'' missions.<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/> Ames commissioned a documentary film by George Van Valkenburg titled \"Jupiter Odyssey\". It received numerous international awards, and is visible on Van Valkenburg's YouTube channel.\n\nIn February 1970, Ames awarded a combined US$380 million contract to [[TRW Inc.]] for building both of the ''Pioneer 10'' and ''11'' vehicles, bypassing the usual bidding process to save time. B. J. O'Brien and Herb Lassen led the TRW team that assembled the spacecraft.{{sfn|Dyer|1998|p=302}} Design and construction of the spacecraft required an estimated 25 million man-hours.{{sfn|Wolverton|2004|p=124}}  An engineer from TRW said \"This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight. If any component fails within that warranty period, just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://aviationweek.com/awin/pioneer-beat-warranty|title= PIONEER BEAT 'WARRANTY'|magazine= Aviation Week |access-date= September 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nTo meet the schedule, the first launch would need to take place between February 29 and March 17 so that it could arrive at Jupiter in November 1974. This was later revised to an arrival date of December 1973 in order to avoid conflicts with other missions over the use of the [[Deep Space Network]] for communications, and to miss the period when Earth and Jupiter would be at opposite sides of the Sun. The encounter trajectory for ''Pioneer 10'' was selected to maximize the information returned about the radiation environment around Jupiter, even if this caused damage to some systems. It would come within about three times the radius of the planet, which was thought to be the closest it could approach and still survive the radiation. The trajectory chosen would give the spacecraft a good view of the sunlit side.{{sfn|Burrows|1990|pp=16&ndash;19}}\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=180px>\nFile:Pioneer 10 systems diagram.svg|''Pioneer 10'' and ''Pioneer 11'' spacecraft diagram\n{{multiple image\nPioneer 10 Construction.jpg|''Pioneer 10'' in the final stages of construction\nPioneer 10 on its kickmotor.jpg|''Pioneer 10'' on a [[Star-37E]] kick motor just prior to being encapsulated for launch\nFile:Centaur pio10.jpg|Pioneer 10 during encapsulation into payload fairing\nFile:NASM-NASM2016-00083.jpg|Reconstructed full-scale mock-up Pioneer 10 / 11 spacecraft at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Spacecraft design===\nThe ''Pioneer 10'' bus measures {{convert|36|cm|in|sp=us}} deep and with six {{convert|76|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} long panels forming the hexagonal structure.

The spacecraft required 100&nbsp;W to power all systems.<ref name=\"PionOdys\"/>{{rp|44–45}} The generators are powered by the radioisotope fuel [[plutonium-238]], which is housed in a multi-layer capsule protected by a graphite heat shield.<ref name=skrabek_mcgrew1987/>\n\nThe pre-launch requirement for the SNAP-19 was to provide power for two years in space; this was greatly exceeded during the mission.<ref name=bennett_skrabek1996/> The plutonium-238 has a [[half-life]] of 87.74 years, so that after 29 years the radiation being generated by the RTGs was at 80% of its intensity at launch. However, steady deterioration of the [[thermocouple]] junctions led to a more rapid decay in electrical power generation, and by 2001 the total power output was 65&nbsp;W. As a result, later in the mission only selected instruments could be operated at any one time.<ref name=prd65_8/>\n\nThe space probe includes a redundant system of [[transceiver]]s, one attached to the narrow-beam, [[high-gain antenna]], the other to an omni-antenna and medium-gain antenna. The parabolic dish for the high-gain antenna is {{convert|2.74|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter and made from an aluminum honeycomb sandwich material. The spacecraft was spun about an axis that is parallel to the axis of this antenna so that it could remain oriented toward the Earth.<ref name=prd65_8/> Each transceiver is an 8&nbsp;W one and transmits data across the [[S-band]] using 2110&nbsp;MHz for the uplink from Earth and 2292&nbsp;MHz for the downlink to Earth with the [[Deep Space Network]] tracking the signal. Data to be transmitted is passed through a [[convolution code|convolutional encoder]] so that most communication errors could be [[error detection and correction|corrected]] by the receiving equipment on Earth.<ref name=\"PionOdys\"/>{{rp|43}} The data transmission rate at launch was 256&nbsp;bit/s, with the rate degrading by about 1.27&nbsp;millibit/s for each day during the mission.<ref name=prd65_8/>\n\nMuch of the computation for the mission is performed on Earth and transmitted to the spacecraft, where it was able to retain in memory up to five commands of the 222 possible entries by ground controllers. The spacecraft includes two command decoders and a command distribution unit, a very limited form of a processor, to direct operations on the spacecraft. This system requires that mission operators prepare commands long in advance of transmitting them to the probe. A data storage unit is included to record up to 6,144 [[bytes]] of information gathered by the instruments. The digital telemetry unit is used to prepare the collected data in one of the thirteen possible formats before transmitting it back to Earth.<ref name=\"PionOdys\"/>{{rp|38}}\n{{-}}\n\n====Scientific instruments====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #e5e5e5\"  | Helium Vector [[Magnetometer]] ('''HVM''')\n|-\n| [[File:Pioneer 10-11 - P50 - fx.jpg|150px]]\n|\nThis instrument measures the fine structure of the interplanetary magnetic field, mapped the Jovian magnetic field, and provided magnetic field measurements to evaluate solar wind interaction with Jupiter.

Testing of the imaging system began, and the data were successfully received back at the Deep Space Network. A series of 16,000 commands were then uploaded to the spacecraft to control the flyby operations during the next sixty days. The orbit of the outer moon [[Sinope (moon)|Sinope]] was crossed on November 8. The [[bow shock]] of Jupiter's magnetosphere was reached on November 16, as indicated by a drop in the velocity of the [[solar wind]] from {{convert|451|km/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} to {{convert|225|km/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The [[magnetopause]] was passed through a day later. The spacecraft instruments confirmed that the magnetic field of Jupiter was inverted compared to that of Earth. By the 29th, the orbits of all of the outermost moons had been passed and the spacecraft was operating flawlessly.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79–93}}\n\nRed and blue pictures of Jupiter were being generated by the imaging photopolarimeter as the rotation of the spacecraft carried the instrument's field of view past the planet. These red and blue colors were combined to produce a synthetic green image, allowing a three-color combination to produce the rendered image. On November 26, a total of twelve such images were received back on Earth. By December 2, the image quality exceeded the best images made from Earth. These were being displayed in real-time back on Earth, and the Pioneer program would later receive an [[Emmy award]] for this presentation to the media. The motion of the spacecraft produced geometric distortions that later had to be corrected by computer processing.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79–93}} During the encounter, a total of more than 500 images were transmitted.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=170}}\n\nThe trajectory of the spacecraft took it along the magnetic equator of Jupiter, where the [[Particle radiation|ion radiation]] was concentrated.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=93}} Peak [[flux]] for this electron radiation is 10,000 times stronger than the maximum radiation around the Earth.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=126}} Starting on December 3, the radiation around Jupiter caused false commands to be generated. Most of these were corrected by contingency commands, but an image of [[Io (moon)|Io]] and a few close-ups of Jupiter were lost. Similar false commands would be generated on the way out from the planet.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79–93}} Nonetheless, ''Pioneer 10'' did succeed in obtaining images of the moons [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. The image of Ganymede showed low [[albedo]] features in the center and near the south pole, while the north pole appeared brighter. Europa was too far away to obtain a detailed image, although some albedo features were apparent.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=121}}\n\nThe trajectory of ''Pioneer 10'' was chosen to take it behind Io, allowing the [[Refraction|refractive effect]] of the moon's atmosphere on the radio transmissions to be measured. This demonstrated that the [[ionosphere]] of the moon was about {{convert|700|km|sp=us}} above the surface of the day side, and the density ranged from 60,000 electrons per cubic centimeter on the dayside, down to 9,000 on the night face. An unexpected discovery was that Io was orbiting within a cloud of hydrogen that extended for about {{convert|805,000|km|sp=us}}, with a width and height of {{convert|402,000|km|sp=us}}. A smaller, {{convert|110,000|km|sp=us}} cloud was believed to have been detected near Europa.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=121}}\n\nIt was not until after ''Pioneer 10'' had cleared the asteroid belt that NASA selected a trajectory towards Jupiter that offered the slingshot effect that would send the spacecraft out of the Solar System.

There was an [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|Advanced Concepts]] study applying [[chaos theory]] to extract coherent data from the fading signal.<ref name=phillips2001/>\n\nThe last successful reception of [[telemetry]] was received from ''Pioneer 10'' on April 27, 2002; subsequent signals were barely strong enough to detect and provided no usable data. The final, very weak signal from ''Pioneer 10'' was received on January 23, 2003, when it was {{Convert|12|e9km|e9mi AU|abbr=unit}} from Earth.<ref>\"This Month in History\", ''Smithsonian'' magazine, June 2003.</ref> Further attempts to contact the spacecraft were unsuccessful. A final attempt was made on the evening of March 4, 2006, the last time the antenna would be correctly aligned with Earth. No response was received from ''Pioneer 10''.<ref name=lakdawalla2006/> NASA decided that the RTG units had probably fallen below the power threshold needed to operate the transmitter. Hence, no further attempts at contact were made.{{sfn|Angelo|2007|p=221}}\n\n=== Timeline ===\n[[File:Pioneer speed and distance from Sun.svg|thumb|right|Pioneer 10 and 11 speed and distance from the Sun]]\n{{interstellar_probes_trajectory.svg}}\n\n{|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Timeline of travel\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Date\n!

The act has numerous critics, many of whom regard the RIPA regulations as excessive and a threat to [[civil liberties]] in the UK. Campaign group [[Big Brother Watch]] published a report in 2010 investigating the improper use of RIPA by local councils.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/TheGrimRIPA.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/TheGrimRIPA.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|title=The Grim RIPA – Cataloguing the ways in which local authorities have abused their covert surveillance powers|website=Big Brother Watch|publisher=bigbrotherwatch.org.uk|access-date=2017-06-07}}</ref> Critics such as [[Keith Vaz]], the chairman of the House of Commons home affairs committee, have expressed concern that the act is being abused for \"petty and vindictive\" cases.<ref name=\"tel\">Gordon Rayner and Richard Alleyne: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080521210928/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1584808/Council-spy-cases-hit-1%2C000-a-month.html Council spy cases hit 1,000 a month]. [[The Daily Telegraph]], 14 April 2008</ref> Similarly, [[Brian Binley]], [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Northampton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Northampton South]] has urged councils to stop using the law, accusing them of acting like [[comic strip]] detective [[Dick Tracy]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/7414382.stm |title=Council 'acted like Dick Tracy' |work=BBC News |date=22 May 2008 |access-date=2009-01-05}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Trading Standards Institute]] has been very critical of these views, stating that the use of surveillance is critical to their success (see [http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/policy/policy-pressitem.cfm/newsid/955 TSI press release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103231412/http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/policy/policy-pressitem.cfm/newsid/955 |date=3 November 2014 }}).\n\nThe \"[[deniable encryption]]\" features in [[free software]] such as [[FreeOTFE]], [[TrueCrypt]] and [[BestCrypt]] could be said to make the task of investigations featuring RIPA much more difficult.\n\nAnother concern is that the Act requires sufficiently large UK [[Internet Service Provider]]s to install technical systems to assist law enforcement agencies with interception activity. Although this equipment must be installed at the ISPs' expense, RIPA does provide that Parliament will examine appropriate funding for ISPs if the cost burden became unfairly high.\n\n===Accusations of oppressive use===\n\nIn April 2008, it became known that council officials in [[Poole]] put three children and their parents under surveillance, at home and in their daily movements, to check whether they lived in a particular school catchment area.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/7341179.stm |title=Family's shock at council spying |work=BBC News |date=10 April 2008 |access-date=2009-01-05}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/7343445.stm  Council admits spying on family], BBC 11 April 2008</ref> Council officials carried out directed surveillance on the family a total of 21 times.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/8343865.stm | work=BBC News | title=Council 'spied on woman 21 times' | date=5 November 2009 | access-date=2010-05-22}}</ref> Tim Martin, the council's head of legal services, had authorised the surveillance and tried to argue that it was justified under RIPA,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/7341179.stm \"Council admits spying on family\"], [[BBC News]], 10 April 2008.

These related to the so-called [[Plebgate]] inquiry and the prosecution of [[Chris Huhne]] for [[Perverting the course of justice|perversion of the course of justice]]. In both cases, journalists' telephone records were obtained using the powers of the act in order to identify their sources, bypassing the usual court proceedings needed to obtain such information.<ref name=\"Guardian 6 Oct 2014\">{{cite news |last= O'Carroll|first= Lisa |date=6 October 2014 |title=Sun makes official complaint over police use of Ripa against journalists| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/06/sun-official-complaint-ripa-journalists-met-police|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=9 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe UK newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' made an official written complaint to the [[Investigatory Powers Tribunal]] to seek a public review of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|London Metropolitan Police's]] use of anti-terror laws to obtain the phone records of [[Tom Newton Dunn]], its political editor, in relation to its inquiry into the \"Plebgate\" affair. ''The Sun’s'' complaint coincided with confirmation that the phone records of the news editor of the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' and one of its freelance journalists had also been obtained by Kent police force when they investigated Chris Huhne's speeding fraud.<ref name=\"Guardian 6 Oct 2014\"/> Journalists' sources are usually agreed to be privileged and protected from disclosure under European laws with which the UK complies. However, by using RIPA an investigating office just needs approval from a senior officer rather than the formal approval of a court hearing. Media lawyers and press freedom groups are concerned by the use of RIPA because it happens in secret and the press have no way of knowing whether their sources have been compromised.<ref name=\"Guardian 6 Oct 2014\"/> Responding to ''The Sun's'' complaint Sir Paul Kennedy, the interception of communications commissioner, launched a full inquiry and urged Home Office ministers to accelerate the introduction of promised protections for journalists, lawyers and others who handle privileged information, including confidential helplines, from such police surveillance operations. He said: \"I fully understand and share the concerns raised by the protection of journalistic sources so as to enable a free press. Today I have written to all chief constables and directed them under section 58 (1) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to provide me with full details of all investigations that have used Ripa powers to acquire communications data to identify journalistic sources. My office will undertake a full inquiry into these matters and report our findings to the prime minister\".<ref>Travis, Alan (October 2014).

Retrieved 10 October 2014.</ref>\n\nOn 12 October 2014, the justice minister, [[Simon Hughes]], confirmed on [[Sky News]]'s ''Murnaghan'' programme that the UK government will reform RIPA to prevent the police using surveillance powers to discover journalists' sources. He said that the police's use of RIPA's powers had been \"entirely inappropriate\" and in future the authorisation of a judge would be needed for police forces to be given approval to access journalists' phone records in pursuit of a criminal investigation. The presumption would be that if a journalist was acting in the public interest, they would be protected, he added. Hughes further said that if the police made an application to a court he would assume a journalist would be informed that the authorities were seeking to access his phone records. More than 100,000 RIPA requests are made every year for access to communications data against targets including private citizens. It is not known how many have involved journalists' phones.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wintour |first=Patrick |date=12 October 2014  |title=British police's use of Ripa powers to snoop on journalists to be reined in |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/police-ripa-powers-journalists-surveillance |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=13 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Prosecutions under RIPA==\nA number of offences have been prosecuted involving the abuse of investigatory powers.
