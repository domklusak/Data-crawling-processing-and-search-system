The election was a [[political realignment]] that ushered in a generation of Democratic-Republican leadership. This was the first presidential election in American history to be a rematch.\n\nAdams had narrowly defeated Jefferson in the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 election]]. Under the rules of the electoral system in place before the 1804 ratification of the [[12th Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]], each member of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] cast two votes, with no distinction made between electoral votes for president and electoral votes for vice president. As Jefferson received the second-most votes in 1796, he was elected vice president. In 1800, unlike in 1796, both parties formally nominated tickets. The Democratic-Republicans nominated a ticket consisting of Jefferson and [[Aaron Burr]], while the Federalists nominated a ticket consisting of Adams and [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Charles C. Pinckney]]. Each party formed a plan by which one of their respective electors would vote for a third candidate or abstain so that its preferred presidential candidate (Adams for the Federalists and Jefferson for the Democratic-Republicans) would win one more vote than the party's other nominee.{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}}\n\nThe chief political issues revolved around the fallout from the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Quasi-War]]. The Federalists favored a strong central government and close relations with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. The Democratic-Republicans favored decentralization to the state governments, and the party attacked the taxes the Federalists imposed. The Democratic-Republicans also denounced the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], which the Federalists had passed to make it harder for immigrants to become citizens and to restrict statements critical of the federal government. The Democratic-Republicans were well organized at the state and local levels, while the Federalists were disorganized and suffered a bitter split between their two major leaders, Adams and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. According to historian [[John E. Ferling|John Ferling]], the jockeying for electoral votes, regional divisions, and the propaganda smear campaigns created by both parties made the election recognizably modern.<ref name=\"Ferling 2004\" />\n\nAt the end of a long and bitter campaign, Jefferson and Burr each won 73 electoral votes, Adams won 65, and Pinckney won 64. The Federalists swept [[New England]], the Democratic-Republicans dominated the [[Southern United States|South]], and the parties split the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Democratic-Republicans' failure to execute their plan{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}} to award Jefferson one more vote than Burr resulted in a tie, which necessitated a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Under the terms laid out in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], the outgoing House of Representatives chose between Jefferson and Burr. Burr was accused of campaigning for the presidency himself in the contingent election despite being a member of Jefferson's party. Each state delegation cast one vote, and a victory in the contingent election required one candidate to win a majority of the state delegations. Neither Burr nor Jefferson was able to win on the first 35 ballots of the contingent election, as most Federalist representatives backed Burr and all Democratic-Republican representatives backed Jefferson. Hamilton favored Jefferson over Burr, and he convinced several Federalists to switch their support to Jefferson, giving Jefferson a victory on the 36th ballot. Jefferson became the second consecutive incumbent vice president to be elected president. This is one of two presidential elections (along with the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 election]]) that have been decided in the House.\n\n== Candidates ==\nBoth parties used [[congressional nominating caucus]]es to formally nominate tickets for the first time. The Federalists nominated a ticket consisting of incumbent President [[John Adams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]]. Pinckney had fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and later served as the [[United States Ambassador to France|minister]] to [[France]]. The Democratic-Republicans nominated a ticket consisting of Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]] of [[Virginia]] and former Senator [[Aaron Burr]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Jefferson had been the runner-up in the previous election and had co-founded the party with [[James Madison]] and others, while Burr was popular in the electorally important state of New York.<ref name=\"deskins1\">{{Cite book |last1=Deskins |first1=Donald Richard |title=Presidential Elections, 1789–2008: County, State, and National Mapping of Election Data |last2=Walton |first2=Hanes |last3=Puckett |first3=Sherman |date=2010 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=33–34}}</ref>\n\n=== Federalist candidates ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Gilbert Stuart, John Adams, c. 1800-1815, NGA 42933.jpg|[[President of the United States|President]]<br />{{nowrap|'''[[John Adams]]'''}}<br />{{nowrap|from [[Massachusetts]]}}\nFile:CharlesCPinckney crop.jpg|Former<br />{{nowrap|[[List of ambassadors of the United States to France|Minister to France]]}}<br />{{nowrap|'''[[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Charles C.<br />Pinckney]]'''}}<br />{{nowrap|from [[South Carolina]]}}\n</gallery>\n\n=== Democratic-Republican candidates ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|{{nowrap|[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]}}<br />{{nowrap|'''[[Thomas Jefferson]]'''}}<br />{{nowrap|from [[Virginia]]}}\nFile:Vanderlyn Burr.jpg|Former<br />{{nowrap|[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]}}<br />{{nowrap|'''[[Aaron Burr]]'''}}<br />{{nowrap|from [[New York (state)|New York]]}}\n</gallery>\n\n== General election ==\n=== Campaign ===\nWhile the 1800 election was a re-match of the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 election]], it ushered in a new type of American politics, a two-party republic and [[acrimonious]] campaigning behind the scenes and through the press.

The Democratic-Republicans felt that the Adams foreign policy was too favorable toward Britain; feared that the new army called up for the [[Quasi-War]] would oppress the people; opposed new taxes to pay for war; and attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts as violations of [[states' rights]] and the Constitution. \"High Federalists\" considered Adams too moderate and would have preferred the leadership of Alexander Hamilton instead.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sisson, Dan, 1937-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/886106713|title=The American revolution of 1800 : how Jefferson rescued democracy from tyranny and faction and what this means today|others=Hartmann, Thom, 1951-|date=September 15, 2014|isbn=978-1-60994-986-0|edition=40th anniversary|location=San Francisco|oclc=886106713}}</ref>\n\nHamilton had apparently grown impatient with Adams and wanted a new president who was more receptive to his goals. During Washington's presidency, Hamilton had been able to influence the federal response to the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] (which threatened the government's power to tax citizens).

By 1800, Hamilton had come to realize that Adams was too independent and thought the Federalist vice presidential candidate, [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] of South Carolina, more suited to serving Hamilton's interests. In his third sabotage attempt toward Adams,<ref>McCullough (2001)</ref> Hamilton quietly schemed to elect Pinckney to the presidency. Given Pinckney's lack of political experience, he would have been expected to be open to Hamilton's influence. However, Hamilton's plan backfired and hurt the Federalist party, particularly after one of his letters, a scathing criticism of Adams that was fifty-four pages long,<ref name=\"Chernow 2004\">Chernow (2004)</ref> fell into the hands of a Democratic-Republican and soon after became public.

In several states, this included changing the process of selecting electors to ensure the desired result.

Virginia switched from electoral districts to winner-take-all, a move that probably switched one or two votes out of the Federalist column.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Voting ===\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1800Colorbrewer.png|thumb|upright=1.9|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning candidate in each county. Shades of blue are for Jefferson (Democratic-Republican) and shades of yellow are for Adams (Federalist).]]\nBecause each state could choose its own election day in 1800, the voting lasted from April to October. In April, Burr's mobilization of the vote in New York City succeeded in reversing the Federalist majority in the state legislature to provide decisive support for the Democratic-Republican ticket.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} With the two parties tied 65–65 in the Electoral College in the autumn of 1800, the last state to vote, South Carolina, chose eight Democratic-Republicans to award the election to Jefferson and Burr.\n\nUnder the [[United States Constitution]] as it then stood, each elector cast two votes, and the candidate with a majority of the votes was elected president, with the vice presidency going to the runner-up. The Federalists therefore arranged for one of their electors to vote for [[John Jay]] rather than for Pinckney. The Democratic-Republicans had a similar plan to have one of their electors cast a vote for another candidate instead of Burr but failed to execute it,{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=July 2023}}{{Why|reason=Was it intentional or a mistake?|date=December 2020}} thus all of the Democratic-Republican electors cast their votes for both Jefferson and Burr, 73 in all for each of them. According to a provision of the United States Constitution, a tie in a case of this type had to be resolved by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], with each state casting one vote.

Pickney, and John Jay) in the House of Representatives. With these votes, the total number of votes for Jefferson and Burr was 73, which gave them a majority of the total, but they were tied.<ref name=\"Jefferson counts\" />\n\nDuring the controversial [[2020 United States presidential election]], Jefferson's action to count Georgia's votes was cited as precedent by allies of President [[Donald Trump]] such as U.S. Representative [[Louie Gohmert]], White House personnel director [[Johnny McEntee]], and attorney [[John C.

Adams made gains in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, but these votes were not enough to offset the Democratic-Republican gains elsewhere. Of the 155 counties and independent cities making returns, Jefferson and Burr won in 115 (74.19%), whereas the Adams ticket carried 40 (25.81%). This was the last time that Vermont voted for the Federalists, and the last time a Federalist won electoral votes from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1800-Large.png|thumb|400px]]\n{{start U.S. presidential election box|pv_footnote=<sup>(a), (b), (c)</sup>|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential election box row|name=[[Thomas Jefferson]]|party=[[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]]|state=[[Virginia]]|pv=45,467|pv_pct=60.5%|ev=73}}\n{{U.S. presidential election box row|name=[[Aaron Burr]]|party=[[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv=—|pv_pct=—|ev=73}}\n{{U.S. presidential election box row|name=[[John Adams]] (incumbent)|party=[[Federalist Party|Federalist]]|state=[[Massachusetts]]|pv=29,621|pv_pct=39.4%|ev=65}}\n{{U.S. presidential election box row|name=[[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]]|party=[[Federalist Party|Federalist]]| state=[[South Carolina]]|pv=—|pv_pct=—|ev=64}}\n{{U.S. presidential election box row|name=[[John Jay]]|party=[[Federalist Party|Federalist]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv=—|pv_pct=—|ev=1}}\n{{U.S. presidential election box other|footnote=<sup>(d)</sup>|pv=54|pv_pct=0.1%}}\n{{end U.S. presidential election box|pv=75,142|ev=276|to_win=70}}\n\n'''Source (Popular Vote):''' ''A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787–1825''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog?commit=Limit&f%5Belection_type_sim%5D%5B%5D=General&f%5Boffice_id_ssim%5D%5B%5D=ON056&page=2&q=1820&range%5Bdate_sim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=1820&range%5Bdate_sim%5D%5Bend%5D=1820&search_field=all_fields&utf8=%E2%9C%93|title=A New Nation Votes|website=elections.lib.tufts.edu}}</ref><br />'''Source (Electoral Vote):''' {{National Archives EV source|year=1800|as of=July 30, 2005}}\n\n<sup>(a)</sup> ''Votes for Federalist electors have been assigned to John Adams and votes for Democratic-Republican electors have been assigned to Thomas Jefferson.''<br /><sup>(b)</sup> ''Only 6 of the 16 states chose electors by any form of popular vote.''<br /><sup>(c)</sup> ''Those states that did choose electors by popular vote had widely varying restrictions on suffrage via property requirements.''<br /><sup>(d)</sup> ''Eight votes were cast for electors pledged to both Adams and Jefferson; 46 votes were cast for electors of unknown affiliation.''\n{{bar box\n|title=Popular vote\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|width=600px\n|barwidth=410px\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|'''Jefferson'''|{{party color|Democratic-Republican Party}}|60.5}}\n{{bar percent|Adams|{{party color|Federalist Party}}|39.4}}\n}}\n{{bar box\n|title=Electoral vote\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|width=600px\n|barwidth=410px\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|'''Jefferson'''|{{party color|Democratic-Republican Party}}|52.9}}\n{{bar percent|Burr|{{party color|Democratic-Republican Party (United States)}}|52.9}}\n{{bar percent|Adams|{{party color|Federalist Party}}|47.1}}\n{{bar percent|Pinckney|{{party color|Federalist Party}}|46.4}}\n{{bar percent|Jay|{{party color|Federalist Party}}|0.7}}\n}}\n\n=== Electoral College vote by state ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!

In Rhode Island and Virginia, voters elected their state's entire Electoral College delegation at large; Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee all used some variation of single-member districts. In the rest, electors were chosen by the state legislature. Not until the 1836 presidential election would all states have direct popular selection of electors (except South Carolina, which had its state legislature vote for electors until 1868). Popular vote records for several states are incomplete, and the returns from Kentucky and Tennessee appear to have been lost; states did not print or issue electoral ballots, and most were issued by newspapers that supported a particular party or candidate. Newspapers are also the main source of voting records in the early 19th century, and frontier states such as Tennessee had few in operation, without any known surviving examples. Below are the surviving popular vote figures as published in ''A New Nation Votes.''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|\n!colspan=3| Thomas Jefferson<br />Democratic-Republican\n!colspan=3| John Adams<br />Federalist\n!colspan=2| Margin\n!

There were sixteen states, each with one vote; an absolute majority of nine was required for victory. It was the outgoing House of Representatives, controlled by the Federalist Party, that was charged with electing the new president. Jefferson was the great enemy of the Federalists, and a faction of Federalist representatives tried to block him and elect Burr.  Most Federalists voted for Burr, giving Burr six of the eight states controlled by Federalists. The seven delegations controlled by Democratic-Republicans all voted for Jefferson, and Georgia's sole Federalist representative also voted for him, giving him eight states. The Vermont delegation was evenly split and cast a blank ballot. The remaining state, Maryland, had five Federalist representatives to three Democratic-Republicans; one of its Federalist representatives voted for Jefferson, forcing that state delegation also to cast a blank ballot.{{sfn|Ferling|2004|pp=175-196}}\n\nPublicly, Burr remained quiet between mid-December 1800 and mid-February 1801, when the electoral votes were counted. Behind the scenes, he faced mounting pressure from within the party to step aside if he and Jefferson should tie in electoral votes. However, there was confusion as to whether or not Burr could simply concede the presidency to Jefferson and become vice-president, or whether he would have been forced to withdraw entirely and allow one of the Federalist candidates to become vice-president, as the Constitution was unclear on the matter. Regardless, he refused to disavow the presidency, writing in December 1800 to Representative [[Samuel Smith (Maryland politician)|Samuel Smith]] (R-MD) that he would not \"engage to resign\" if chosen president, adding that the question was \"unnecessary, unreasonable and impertinent.\" Rumors circulated that Representative [[James A. Bayard (elder)|James A. Bayard]] (F-DE) had—purportedly in Burr's name—approached Smith and [[Edward Livingston]] (R-NY) with offers of political appointments if they voted for Burr.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Van Bergen |first=Jennifer |date=Spring 2003 |title=Aaron Burr and the Electoral Tie of 1801:Strict Constitutional Construction |url=http://www.cplpej.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Van-Bergen-Jennifer.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=The Cardozo Public Law, Policy & Ethics Journal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=91–130 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722011357/http://www.cplpej.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Van-Bergen-Jennifer.pdf |archive-date=July 22, 2018 |access-date=July 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nTrue or not, House Democratic-Republicans, who from the start of the 1800 campaign viewed Jefferson as their candidate for president and Burr for vice president, faced two abhorrent possible outcomes when the House met to vote: the Federalists could engineer a victory for Burr; or the Federalists could refuse to break the deadlock, leaving Federalist Secretary of State [[John Marshall]] as Acting President.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Colvin |first1=Nathan L. |last2=Foley |first2=Edward B. |year=2010 |title=The Twelfth Amendment: A Constitutional Ticking Time Bomb |url=https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1204&context=umlr |journal=University of Miami Law Review |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=475–534 |access-date=July 21, 2018}}</ref> Neither came to pass, however,<ref>Roberts (2008)</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2023}} chiefly{{Fact|date=September 2023}} due to Hamilton's energetic opposition to Burr.

The four representatives present from South Carolina, all Federalists, also changed their 3–1 selection of Burr to four abstentions.\n\nDue to the experiences of this and the previous election, sentiment for a new way of selecting the president and vice president rose significantly, resulting in the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]].\n\n=== Results ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2; margin-bottom:-1px; border:1px solid #aaa; padding: .2em .4em\" | 1801 [[Contingent election|Contingent]] United States presidential election\n|-\n! colspan=4 style=\"font-size:92%\" | February 11–17, 1801{{snd}}1st through 35th ballots\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Candidate\n!

With former [[President of the United States|president]] [[John Adams]] in retirement, the Federalists turned to Pinckney, a former ambassador and [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero who had been Adams's running mate in the 1800 election.\n\nThough Jefferson had only narrowly defeated Adams in 1800, he was widely popular due to the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and a strong economy. He carried almost every state, including most states in the Federalist stronghold of [[New England]]. \n\n==Background==\nAlthough the [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 presidential election]] was a close one, Jefferson steadily gained popularity during his term.

Leaderless and disorganized, the Federalists failed to attract much support outside of [[New England]]. The Federalists attacked the Louisiana Purchase as unconstitutional, criticized Jefferson's [[gunboat]] navy, and alleged that Jefferson had fathered children with his [[slavery in the United States|slave]], [[Sally Hemings]], but the party failed to galvanize opposition to Jefferson. Jefferson's policies of expansionism and reduced government spending were widely popular. Jefferson was aided by an effective Democratic-Republican party organization, which had continued to develop since 1800, especially in the Federalist stronghold of [[New England]].<ref name=\"deskins1\"/>\n\nJefferson's victory was overwhelming, and he even won four of the five New England states. Pinckney won only two states, [[Connecticut]] and [[Delaware]]. This was the first election where the Democratic-Republicans won in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.\n\nAs of 2023, Jefferson was the first of seven presidential nominees to win a significant number of electoral votes in at least three elections, the others being Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, Grover Cleveland, William Jennings Bryan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Richard Nixon. Of these, Jackson, Cleveland, and Roosevelt also won the popular vote in at least three elections. Jefferson, Cleveland, and Roosevelt were also their respective party's nominees for three consecutive elections.\n\n===Results===\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1804-Large.png|thumb|500px]]\n[[File:1804 United States presidential election by county.svg|thumb|500px]]\n[[File:United States Electoral College 1804.svg]]\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=<sup>(a), (b)</sup>|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Thomas Jefferson]] (incumbent)|vp_name=[[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]|party=[[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]]|state=[[Virginia]]|vp_state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv=104,110|pv_pct=72.8%|ev=162}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Charles C.

The [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] candidate [[James Madison]] defeated [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] candidate [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] decisively.\n\nMadison had served as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] since [[President of the United States|President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] took office in 1801. Jefferson, who had declined to run for a third term, threw his strong support behind Madison, a fellow [[Virginia]]n. Sitting [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] and former Ambassador [[James Monroe]] both challenged Madison for leadership of the party, but Madison won his party's nomination and Clinton was re-nominated as vice president. The Federalists chose to re-nominate Pinckney, a former ambassador who had served as the party's [[1804 United States presidential election|1804]] nominee, again alongside [[Rufus King]].\n\nDespite the unpopularity of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], Madison won the vast majority of electoral votes outside of the Federalist stronghold of [[New England]]. Clinton received six electoral votes for president from his home state of New York. This election was the first of two instances in American history in which a new president was selected but the incumbent vice president won re-election, the other being in [[1828 United States presidential election|1828]].\n\n==Nominations==\n===Democratic-Republican Party nomination===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Tricolour Cockade.svg|65px|center|link=Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican Party]]<big>'''1808 Democratic-Republican Party Ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"| [[James Madison|{{color|white|James Madison}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"| [[George Clinton (vice president)|{{color|white|George Clinton}}]]\n|-\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#90EE90; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#90EE90; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:James_Madison_by_Gilbert_Stuart_(3).jpg|center|200x200px]]\n| [[File:George Clinton by Ezra Ames.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|-\n| [[List of secretaries of state of the United States|5th]]<br>[[U.S. Secretary of State]]<br><small>(1801–1809)</small>\n| [[List of vice presidents of the United States|4th]]<br>[[Vice President of the United States]]<br><small>(1805–1812)</small>\n|-\n|}\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|203x203px|[[Thomas Jefferson]], the incumbent president in 1808, whose second term expired on March 4, 1809]]\n\n==== Presidential candidates ====\n* [[James Madison]] ([[Virginia]]), [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]\n* [[James Monroe]] ([[Virginia]]), Former U.S. Ambassador to the [[United Kingdom]]\n* [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] ([[New York (state)|New York]]), [[Vice President of the United States]]\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:James_Madison_by_Gilbert_Stuart_(3).jpg|Secretary of State <br> '''[[James Madison]]''' <br> from [[Virginia]]\nFile:James Monroe White House portrait 1819.jpg|Former U.S. Ambassador <br> [[James Monroe]] <br> from [[Virginia]]\nFile:George Clinton by Ezra Ames.jpg|Vice President <br> [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] <br> from [[New York (state)|New York]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Vice-presidential candidates====\n* [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] ([[New York (state)|New York]]), [[Vice President of the United States]]\n* [[John Langdon (politician)|John Langdon]] ([[New Hampshire]]), [[Governor of New Hampshire|Governor]]\n* [[Henry Dearborn]] ([[Massachusetts]]), [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]]\n* [[John Quincy Adams]] ([[Massachusetts]]), [[United States Senator]]\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:George Clinton by Ezra Ames.jpg|Vice President <br> '''[[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]''' <br> from [[New York (state)|New York]]\nFile:John langdon.jpg|Governor <br> [[John Langdon (politician)|John Langdon]] <br> from [[New Hampshire]]\nFile:Gilbert Stuart - Major-General Henry Dearborn - 1913.793 - Art Institute of Chicago.jpg|Secretary of War <br> [[Henry Dearborn]] <br> from [[Massachusetts]]\nFile:Gilbert Stuart - John Quincy Adams - Google Art Project.jpg|Senator <br> [[John Quincy Adams]]<br>from [[Massachusetts]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Caucus====\n\nSenator [[Stephen R.

It was held from Wednesday, November 1, to Wednesday, December 6, 1820. Taking place at the height of the [[Era of Good Feelings]], the election saw incumbent [[Democratic-Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Monroe]] win re-election without a major opponent. It was the [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|third]] and the most recent United States presidential election in which a presidential candidate ran effectively unopposed. As of 2023, this is the most recent presidential election where an incumbent president was re-elected who was neither a Democrat nor a Republican, before the Democratic-Republican party split into separate parties.\n\nMonroe and Vice President [[Daniel D. Tompkins]] faced no opposition from other Democratic-Republicans in their quest for a second term. The [[Federalist Party]] had fielded a presidential candidate in each election since [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]], but the party's already-waning popularity had declined further following the [[War of 1812]]. Although able to field [[Richard Stockton (U.S. senator)|a nominee for vice president]], the Federalists could not put forward a presidential candidate, leaving Monroe without organized opposition.\n\nMonroe won every state and received all but one of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] received the only other electoral vote, which came from [[faithless elector]] [[William Plumer]]. Nine different Federalists received electoral votes for vice president, but Tompkins won re-election by a large margin. No other post-[[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] presidential candidate has matched Monroe's share of the electoral vote. Monroe and [[George Washington]] remain the only presidential candidates to run without any major opposition. Monroe's victory was the last of six straight victories by Virginians in presidential elections (Jefferson twice, Madison twice, and Monroe twice). This was the last election in which an incumbent ticket got reelected until the ticket of [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Thomas R. Marshall]] got reelected in [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]].\n\n== Background ==\nDespite the continuation of single party politics (known in this case as the [[Era of Good Feelings]]), serious issues emerged during the election in 1820. The nation had endured a widespread depression following the [[Panic of 1819]] and momentous disagreement about the extension of slavery into the territories was taking center stage. Nevertheless, James Monroe faced no opposition party or candidate in his re-election bid, although he did not receive  all of the electoral votes (see below).\n\nMassachusetts was entitled to 22 electoral votes in 1816, but cast only 15 in 1820 by reason of the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, which made the region of [[Maine]], long part of Massachusetts, a free state to balance the pending admission of slave state Missouri. In addition, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Mississippi also cast one fewer electoral vote than they were entitled to, as one elector from each state died before the electoral meeting. Consequently, this meant that Mississippi cast only two votes, when any state is always entitled to a minimum of three. This is one of only three times a state or district has cast under the minimum of three electoral votes, the others being [[Nevada]] in [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]] and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]. In the case of the former, an elector was snowbound and there was no law to replace him (Nevada had only become a state that year). In that of the latter, a faithless elector abstained from voting.\n\nAlabama, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi and Missouri participated in their first presidential election in 1820, Missouri with controversy since it was not yet officially a state (see below). No new states would participate in American presidential elections until 1836, after the admission to the Union of Arkansas in 1836 and Michigan in 1837 (after the main voting, but before the counting of the electoral vote in Congress).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h261.html|title=Election of 1820|website=www.u-s-history.com}}</ref>\n\n== Nominations ==\n=== Democratic-Republican Party nomination ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Tricolour Cockade.svg|65px|center|link=Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican Party]]<big>'''1820 Democratic-Republican Party Ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"| [[James Monroe|{{color|white|James Monroe}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"| [[Daniel D.

Monroe and Tompkins appeared on the ballot with the support of the Democratic-Republican Party despite not being formally nominated.<ref>{{cite book |date=1979 |title=National Party Conventions, 1831-1976 |publisher=[[Congressional Quarterly]]}}</ref>\n\n== General election ==\n=== Campaign ===\nEffectively there was no campaign, since there was no serious opposition to Monroe and Tompkins.\n\n=== Disputes ===\n{{see also|Missouri Compromise#Second Missouri Compromise}}\nOn March 9, 1820, Congress had passed a law directing Missouri to hold a convention to form a constitution and a state government. This law stated that \"the said state, when formed, shall be admitted into the Union, upon an equal footing with the original states, in all respects whatsoever.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=Act of March 6, ch. 23, vol. 3 |title=United States Statutes at Large |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj06845)) |access-date=August 9, 2006 |year=1820 |pages=545–548}}</ref> However, when Congress reconvened in November 1820, the admission of Missouri became an issue of contention. Proponents claimed that Missouri had fulfilled the conditions of the law and therefore was a state; detractors contended that certain provisions of the Missouri Constitution violated the United States Constitution.\n\nBy the time Congress was due to meet to count the electoral votes from the election, this dispute had lasted over two months. The counting raised a ticklish problem: if Congress counted Missouri's votes, that would count as recognition that Missouri was a state; on the other hand, if Congress failed to count Missouri's vote, it would count as recognition that Missouri was not a state. Knowing ahead of time that Monroe had won in a landslide and that Missouri's vote would therefore make no difference in the final result, the Senate passed a resolution on February 13, 1821 stating that if a protest were made, there would be no consideration of the matter unless the vote of Missouri would change who would become president. Instead, the President of the Senate would announce the final tally twice, once with Missouri included and once with it excluded.<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 13 |title=Senate Journal |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |access-date=July 29, 2006 |year=1821 |pages=187–188}}</ref>\n\nThe next day this resolution was introduced in the full House. After a lively debate, it was passed. Nonetheless, during the counting of the electoral votes on February 14, 1821, an objection was raised to the votes from Missouri by Representative [[Arthur Livermore]] of New Hampshire. He argued that since Missouri had not yet officially become a state, it had no right to cast any electoral votes. Immediately, Representative [[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]] of Virginia argued that Missouri's votes must be counted. Chaos ensued, and order was restored only with the counting of the vote as per the resolution and then adjournment for the day.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Gales and Seaton |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 14, 1821 |title=Annals of Congress |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |access-date=July 29, 2006 |year=1856 |pages=1147–1165}}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1820-Large.png|thumb|500px]]\n\n===Popular vote===\nThe Federalists received a small amount of the popular vote despite having no electoral candidates.

In fact, Plumer simply thought that Monroe was a mediocre president and that Adams would be a better one.<ref>Turner (1955) p 253</ref> Plumer also refused to vote for Tompkins for Vice President as \"grossly intemperate\", not having \"that weight of character which his office requires,\" and \"because he grossly neglected his duty\" in his \"only\" official role as President of the Senate by being \"absent nearly three-fourths of the time\";<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/about/officers-staff/vice-president/tompkins-daniel.htm \"Daniel D.

The actual Presidential candidates were rarely mentioned on tickets and voters were voting for particular electors who were pledged to a particular candidate. There was sometimes confusion as to who the particular elector was actually pledged to. Results are reported as the highest result for an elector for any given candidate. For example, if three Monroe electors received 100, 50, and 25 votes, Monroe would be recorded as having 100 votes. Confusion surrounding the way results are reported may lead to discrepancies between the sum of all state results and national results.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Federalist electors won 62.06% of the vote. However, only 7,902 of these votes went to Federalist electors who did not cast their votes for Monroe (this being most likely because these Federalist electors lost). Similarly, In Kentucky, 1,941 ballots were cast for an elector labelled as Federalist who proceeded to vote for Monroe. All of the Federalist Monroe votes have been placed in the Federalist column, as the Federalist party fielded no presidential candidate and therefore it is likely these electors simply cast their votes for Monroe because the overwhelming majority he achieved made their votes irrelevant. \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" |James

Economic recovery from the [[Panic of 1837]] was incomplete, and [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] nominee [[William Henry Harrison]] defeated incumbent President [[Martin Van Buren]] of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The election marked the first of two Whig victories in presidential elections, but was the only one where they won a majority of the popular vote. This was the third rematch in American history, which would not occur again until 1892.\n\nIn 1839, the Whigs held a national convention for the first time. The [[1839 Whig National Convention]] saw 1836 nominee William Henry Harrison defeat former Secretary of State [[Henry Clay]] and General [[Winfield Scott]]. Van Buren faced little opposition at the [[1840 Democratic National Convention]], but controversial Vice President [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] was not re-nominated. The Democrats thus became the only major party since 1800 to fail to select a vice presidential nominee.\n\nReferencing vice presidential nominee [[John Tyler]] and Harrison's participation in the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]], the Whigs campaigned on the slogan of \"[[Tippecanoe and Tyler Too]].\" With Van Buren weakened by economic woes, Harrison won a popular majority and 234 of 294 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. Voter participation surged as white male suffrage became nearly universal,<ref>{{cite web |title=White Manhood Suffrage |url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/democracy-exhibition/vote-voice/getting-vote/demanding-vote/white-manhood-suffrage |website=National Museum of American History |access-date=6 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210629070524/https://americanhistory.si.edu/democracy-exhibition/vote-voice/getting-vote/demanding-vote/white-manhood-suffrage |archive-date=29 June 2021 |language=English |url-status=live}}</ref> and a contemporary record of 42.4% of the voting age population voted for Harrison.<ref name=\"turnout\">Between 1828–1928: {{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php|title=Voter Turnout in Presidential Elections: 1828–2008|work=The American Presidency Project|publisher=[[UC Santa Barbara]]|access-date=2012-11-09}}</ref> Van Buren's loss made him the third president to lose re-election.\n\nThe Whigs did not enjoy the benefits of victory. The 67-year-old Harrison, the oldest U.S. president elected until [[Ronald Reagan]] won the 1980 election, died a little more than a month after inauguration. Harrison was succeeded by John Tyler, who unexpectedly proved not to be a Whig. While Tyler had been a staunch supporter of Clay at the convention, he was a former Democrat, a passionate supporter of states' rights, and effectively an independent. As President, Tyler blocked the Whigs' legislative agenda and was expelled from the Whig Party, subsequently the second independent (after Washington) to serve as president.\n\n== Nominations ==\n\n=== Whig Party nomination ===\n{{main|1839 Whig National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|<big>'''1840 Whig Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#F0DC82; width:200px;\"| [[William Henry Harrison|{{color|black|William Henry Harrison}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#F0DC82; width:200px;\"| [[John Tyler|{{color|black|John Tyler}}]]\n|-  style=\"color:#000000; font-size:100%; background:#F0DC82;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:lightyellow; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:lightyellow; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:William Henry Harrison crop.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n| [[File:John Tyler (cropped 3x4).png|center|200x200px]]\n|-\n| [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]<br />from Ohio<br /><small>(1825–1828)</small>\n| U.S. Senator <br>from Virginia<br><small>(1827–1836)</small><br>[[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]]<br /><small>(1835)</small>\n|-\n| colspan=2 |[[William Henry Harrison 1840 presidential campaign|'''Campaign''']]\n|-\n|}\n\nThe first national convention of the Whig Party was called for by members of the party in Congress and it was attended by almost 250 delegates in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]. [[Henry Clay]], William Henry Harrison, and [[Winfield Scott]] ran for the party's presidential nomination. The delegations of each state balloted separately before meeting together with the other representatives of the states. Clay initially led on the first ballot, but Harrison won on the final ballot with 148 votes compared to Clay's 90 votes and Scott's 16 votes after supporters from Scott switched to Harrison.

Delegates from twenty-two states attended the convention, but the sizes of the delegations varied with New Jersey having fifty-nine delegates to cast its eight votes while Massachusetts only had one delegate to cast its fourteen votes.<ref name=\"nomination\" />\n\nA committee was formed to make recommendations for the nominations and the committee supported Van Buren for renomination which was approved by acclamation. However, the vice-presidential nomination was left vacant due to opposition to Vice President [[Richard M. Johnson]]'s personal life.<ref name=\"nomination\" />\n\n=== Anti-Masonic Party nomination ===\nAfter the negative views of Freemasonry among a large segment of the public began to wane in the mid-1830s, the [[Anti-Masonic Party]] disintegrated. Many leaders began to move to the Whig party. Remaining leaders met in September 1837 in Washington, and agreed to maintain the party. The third Anti-Masonic Party National Convention was held in Philadelphia on November 13–14, 1838. By this time, the party had been almost entirely supplanted by the Whigs. The delegates unanimously voted to nominate William Henry Harrison for president (who the party had supported for president the previous election along with [[Francis Granger]] for vice president) and [[Daniel Webster]] for vice president. However, when the Whig National Convention nominated Harrison with John Tyler as his running mate, the Anti-Masonic Party did not make an alternate nomination and ceased to function and was fully absorbed into the Whigs by 1840.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+ Convention vote\n|-\n!

Birney]], [[Myron Holley]], [[Joshua Leavitt]], and [[Gerrit Smith]] proposed the creation of an anti-slavery party. In July 1839, two resolutions proposed by Holley at the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]]'s meeting in Cleveland, called for the creation of an abolitionist party. They failed. Nevertheless, the supporters nominated Birney and [[Francis Julius LeMoyne]] as a presidential ticket at a meeting in [[Warsaw, New York]]. However, Birney declined the presidential nomination as he preferred a nomination to be made by a regular body of abolitionists and LeyMoyne also declined the vice-presidential nomination. Smith and Holley made a call for an abolitionist nominating convention to be held on April 1, 1840, in [[Albany, New York]]. 121 delegates attended the delegation and selected a presidential ticket of Birney and [[Thomas Earle (American politician)|Thomas Earle]]. which was accepted. It took the name [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]].<ref name=\"liberty\">{{cite book |last=Hesseltine |first=William B. |author-link=William B.

The Liberty Party received opposition from followers of [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and abolitionist Whigs. The Liberty Party received 7,453 votes.<ref name=\"liberty\" />\n\n== General election ==\n\n=== Campaign ===\n[[File:The times panic 1837.jpg|thumb|Caricature on the aftermath of the panic of 1837]]\nIn the wake of the [[Panic of 1837]], Van Buren was widely unpopular, and Harrison, following [[Andrew Jackson]]'s strategy, ran as a war hero and man of the people while presenting Van Buren as a wealthy snob living in luxury at the public expense. Although Harrison was comfortably wealthy and well educated, his \"[[log cabin#Symbolism|log cabin]]\" image caught fire, sweeping all sections of the country.\n\nHarrison avoided campaigning on the issues, with his Whig Party attracting a broad coalition with few common ideals. The Whig strategy overall was to win the election by avoiding discussion of difficult national issues such as slavery or the national bank and concentrate instead on exploiting dissatisfaction over the failed policies of the Van Buren administration with colorful campaigning techniques.\n\n==== Log cabin campaign of William Henry Harrison ====\n{{main|William Henry Harrison 1840 presidential campaign}}\nHarrison was the first president to campaign actively for office. He did so with the slogan \"[[Tippecanoe and Tyler too]]\". Tippecanoe referred to [[Battle of Tippecanoe|Harrison's military victory]] over a group of [[Shawnee]] Native Americans at a river in Indiana called [[Tippecanoe River|Tippecanoe]] in 1811. For their part, Democrats laughed at Harrison for being too old for the presidency, and referred to him as \"Granny\", hinting that he was senile. Said one Democratic newspaper: \"Give him a barrel of [[hard cider]], and ... a pension of two thousand [dollars] a year ... and ... he will sit the remainder of his days in his log cabin.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=1840: The Log Cabin and Hard Cider Campaign · Voices and Votes: Democracy on Delmarva · Nabb Research Center Online Exhibits |url=https://libapps.salisbury.edu/nabb-online/exhibits/show/voices/the-machinery-of-democracy/1840--the-log-cabin-and-hard-c |access-date=2023-01-07 |website=libapps.salisbury.edu}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1840ExtentColorbrewer.gif|right|thumb|350px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning candidate in each county. Shades of yellow are for Harrison (Whig) and shades of blue are for Van Buren (Democrat).]]\nWhigs took advantage of this quip and declared that Harrison was \"the log cabin and hard cider candidate\", a man of the common people from the rough-and-tumble West. They depicted Harrison's opponent, President [[Martin Van Buren]], as a wealthy snob who was out of touch with the people. In fact, it was Harrison who came from a family of wealthy planters, while Van Buren's father was a tavernkeeper. Harrison however moved to the frontier and for years lived in a log cabin, while Van Buren had been a well-paid government official.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nNonetheless, the election was held in the wake of the Panic of 1837, one of the worst economic depressions in the nation's history,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Campbell |first=Stephen |date=2020-11-12 |title=Panic of 1837 |url=https://economic-historian.com/2020/11/panic-of-1837/ |access-date=2023-01-07 |website=The Economic Historian |language=en-US}}</ref> and voters blamed Van Buren, seeing him as unsympathetic to struggling citizens. Harrison campaigned vigorously and won.\n\n===Results===\nThis was the first time that a majority of southern voters participated in the election, unlike in the north which has occurred in 1828.{{sfn|Black|Black|1992|p=214}}\n\nHarrison won the support of western settlers and eastern bankers alike. The extent of Van Buren's unpopularity was evident in Harrison's victories in New York, the president's home state, and in Tennessee, where Andrew Jackson himself had come out of retirement to stump for his former vice-president.\n\nOf the 1,179 counties/independent cities making returns, Harrison won in 699 (59.29%) while Van Buren carried 477 (40.46%). Three counties (0.25%) in the South split evenly between Harrison and Van Buren.\n\nThis was the first time a Democratic president lost re-election, as well as the first of only two times (the other being 1980) that a Democratic president lost re-election and lost the popular vote.\n\nHarrison's victory won him precious little time as chief executive of the United States. After giving the [[Inauguration of William Henry Harrison|longest inauguration speech]] in U.S. history (lasting about 1 hour and 45 minutes, in cold weather and rain), Harrison served only one month as president before dying of pneumonia on April 4, 1841. This was also the first election in U.S. history in which a candidate won more than a million popular votes.\n\nThis was the last election where  Indiana voted for the Whigs. It was also the only election where the Whigs won Maine, Michigan, and Mississippi. The election was also the last time that Mississippi voted against the Democrats until 1872, the last in which Indiana did so until 1860, and the last in which Maine and Michigan did so until 1856. This is the only election in American history in which Alabama and Mississippi voted for different candidates.\n\nThe 1840 presidential election was the only U.S. presidential election in which four people who either had been or would become a U.S. President (Van Buren, Harrison, Tyler, and Polk) received at least one vote in the Electoral College.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.270towin.com/1840_Election/|title=1840 Presidential Election|access-date=23 November 2020|website=[[270toWin]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File: United States Electoral College 1840.svg]]\n\n{{Start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=<sup>(a)</sup>|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[William Henry Harrison]]|party=[[United States Whig Party|Whig]]|state=[[Ohio]]|pv=1,275,583|pv_pct=52.87%|ev=234|vp_name=[[John Tyler]]|vp_state=[[Virginia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Martin Van Buren]]|party=[[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv=1,129,645|pv_pct=46.82%|ev=60|vp_count=3|vp_name=[[Richard Mentor Johnson]]|vp_state=[[Kentucky]]|vp_ev=48}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box vp subrow|vp_name=[[Littleton W.

Lincoln's election thus served as the main [[Origins of the American Civil War|catalyst of the states that would become the Confederacy seceding from the Union]]. This marked the first time that a Republican was elected president.  It was also the first presidential election in which both major party candidates were registered in the same home state; the others have been in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]], [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]], [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]].\n\nThe United States had become increasingly sectionally divided during the 1850s, primarily over extending [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] into the western [[United States territories|territories]]. The incumbent president, [[James Buchanan]], like his predecessor, [[Franklin Pierce]], was a Northern [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] with [[Southern United States|Southern]] sympathies. Buchanan also adamantly promised not to seek re-election. From the mid-1850s, the anti-slavery Republican Party became a major political force, driven by Northern voter opposition to the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] and the Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''. From the election of [[1856 United States presidential election|1856]], the Republican Party had replaced the defunct [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] as the major opposition to the Democrats. A group of former Whigs and [[Know Nothing]]s formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], which sought to avoid disunion by resolving divisions over slavery with some new compromise.\n\nThe [[1860 Republican National Convention]] in Chicago nominated Abraham Lincoln, a moderate former one-term Whig Representative from Illinois. Its platform promised not to interfere with slavery in the South but opposed extension of slavery into the territories. The [[1860 Democratic National Convention]] adjourned in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], without agreeing on a nominee, but a second convention in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], nominated Illinois Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. Douglas's support for the concept of [[popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]], which called for [[Freeport Doctrine|each territory's settlers to decide locally on the status of slavery]], alienated many radical pro-slavery Southern Democrats, who wanted the territories, and [[Knights of the Golden Circle|perhaps other lands]], open to slavery. With President Buchanan's support, Southern Democrats held their own convention, nominating Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]] of [[Kentucky]]. The [[1860 Constitutional Union Convention]] nominated a ticket led by former Tennessee Senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]].\n\nLincoln's main opponent in the North was Douglas, who won the popular vote in two states, Missouri and New Jersey. Douglas was the only candidate in the 1860 election to win electoral votes in both free and slave states. In the South, Bell won three states and Breckinridge swept the remaining 11. Lincoln's election motivated seven Southern states, all voting for Breckinridge, to secede before the [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|inauguration]] in March. The American Civil War began less than two months after Lincoln's inauguration, with the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]]; afterwards four further states seceded. Lincoln would go on to win re-election in the [[1864 United States presidential election]]. The election was the first of six consecutive Republican victories. Despite Lincoln's commanding victory, this was the first election in American history in which the winner has failed to win his home county, with Lincoln narrowly losing [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]] to Douglas. However, he would win [[Gasconade County, Missouri|Gasconade County]] which, as of the [[2020 United States presidential election]], has voted Republican ever since, marking the beginning of the longest active voting streak for any party at the county level.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Nominations==\nThe 1860 presidential election conventions were unusually tumultuous, due in particular to a split in the Democratic Party that led to rival conventions.\n\n===Republican nomination===\n{{Main|1860 Republican National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|<big>1860 Republican Party ticket</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\" |[[Abraham Lincoln|{{color|white|Abraham Lincoln}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\" |[[Hannibal Hamlin|{{color|white|Hannibal Hamlin}}]]\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#FFD0D7;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\" |'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\" |'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n|[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-26 by Hesler, 1860 (cropped).jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|[[File:Hannibal Hamlin, photo portrait seated, c1860-65-retouched-crop.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|-\n| [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]]<br />for [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|Illinois's 7th]]<br /><small>(1847–1849)</small>\n|[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Maine]]<br /><small>(1848–1857, 1857–1861)</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Abraham Lincoln#1860 Presidential nomination and campaign|'''Campaign''']]\n|}\n\nRepublican candidates:\n\n* Abraham Lincoln, former representative from Illinois\n* William Seward, senator from New York\n* Simon Cameron, senator from Pennsylvania\n* Salmon P.

With the Democrats in disarray and a sweep of the Northern states possible, the Republicans felt confident going into their convention in [[Chicago]]. [[William H. Seward]] from New York was considered the front-runner, followed by [[Salmon P. Chase]] from Ohio, and Missouri's [[Edward Bates]]. [[Abraham Lincoln]] from Illinois, was lesser-known, and was not considered to have a good chance against Seward. Seward had been governor and senator of New York and was an able politician with a Whig background. Also running were [[John C. Frémont]], [[William L. Dayton]], [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (politician)|Cassius M. Clay]], and [[Benjamin Wade]], who might be able to win if the convention deadlocked.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book| last=Donald|first=David Herbert| url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32589068| title=Lincoln| publisher=Simon & Schuster| year=1995| isbn=0-684-80846-3|location=New York|pages=230–256| oclc=32589068}}</ref>\n\nAs the convention developed, however, it was revealed that frontrunners Seward, Chase, and Bates had each alienated factions of the Republican Party. Seward had been painted as a radical, and his speeches on slavery predicted inevitable conflict, which spooked moderate delegates. He also was firmly opposed to [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], which further weakened his position. He had also been abandoned by his longtime friend and political ally [[Horace Greeley]], publisher of the influential ''[[New-York Tribune]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nChase, a former Democrat, had alienated many of the former Whigs by his coalition with the Democrats in the late 1840s. He had also opposed tariffs demanded by Pennsylvania and even had opposition from his own delegation from Ohio.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}} However, Chase's firm antislavery stance made him popular with the Radical Republicans. But what he offered in policy he lacked in charisma and political acumen.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe conservative Bates was an unlikely candidate but found support from Horace Greeley, who sought any chance to defeat Seward, with whom he now had a bitter feud. Bates outlined his positions on the extension of slavery into the territories and equal constitutional rights for all citizens, positions that alienated his supporters in the border states and Southern conservatives, while [[German Americans]] in the party opposed Bates because of his past association with the [[Know Nothing]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInto this mix came Lincoln. Lincoln was not unknown; he had gained prominence in the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates]] and had represented Illinois in the House of Representatives. He had been quietly eyeing a run since the Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858, ensuring that the debates were widely published and that a biography of himself was published. He gained great notability with his February 1860 [[Cooper Union speech]], which may have ensured him the nomination. He had not yet announced his intentions to run, but it was a superb speech. Delivered in Seward's home state and attended by Greeley, Lincoln used the speech to show that the Republican party was a party of moderates, not crazed fanatics, as the South and Democrats claimed. Afterward, Lincoln was in much demand for speaking engagements.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book| last=Holzer| first=Harold| url=https://archive.org/details/lincolnatcooperu00haro_0/page/1|title=Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President| date=November 7, 2006|isbn=0-7432-9964-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/lincolnatcooperu00haro_0/page/1 1]|quote=[H]ad he not triumphed before the sophisticated and demanding audience he faced at New York's Cooper Union on February 27, 1860, Lincoln would likely never have been nominated, much less elected, to the presidency that November.|access-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> As the convention approached, Lincoln did not campaign actively, as the \"office was expected to seek the man\". So it did at the Illinois state convention, a week before the national convention.

Lincoln received a thunderous ovation, surpassing his and his political allies' expectations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lincoln's campaign managers had printed and distributed thousands of fake convention admission tickets to Lincoln supporters to ensure and increase the crowd's support.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lepore|first=Jill|title=These Truths: A History of the United States|publisher=W.

He set about ensuring that he was the second choice of most delegates, realizing that the first round of voting at the convention was unlikely to produce a clear winner. He engineered that the convention would happen in Chicago, which would be inherently friendly to the Illinois-based Lincoln. He also made sure that the Illinois delegation would vote as a bloc for him. Lincoln did not attend the convention in person and left the task of delegate wrangling to several close friends.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first round of voting predictably produced a lead for Seward, but not a majority, with Lincoln in second place. The second round eliminated most of the minor contenders, with voters switching to Seward or mostly to Lincoln. The convention remained deadlocked, however, and skillful political maneuvering by Lincoln's delegate wranglers convinced the delegates to abandon Seward in favor of Lincoln. Lincoln's combination of a moderate stance on slavery, long support for economic issues, his western origins, and strong oratory proved to be exactly what the delegates wanted in a president. On the third ballot on May 18, Lincoln secured the presidential nomination overwhelmingly.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Proceedings of the Republican national convention held at Chicago, May 16, 17 and 18, 1860 by Republican National Convention (2nd : 1860 : Chicago, Ill.): Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming: Internet Archive| url=https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofrep00repuiala|access-date=2020-12-28|website=Internet Archive| year=1860|language=en}}</ref> Senator [[Hannibal Hamlin]] from Maine was nominated for vice president, defeating Cassius M.

Nonetheless, loyal army officers in Virginia, Kansas and South Carolina warned Lincoln of military preparations to the contrary. Secessionists threw their support behind Breckinridge in an attempt either to force the anti-Republican candidates to coordinate their electoral votes or throw the election into the House of Representatives, where the selection of the president would be made by the representatives elected in 1858, before the Republican majorities in both House and Senate achieved in 1860 were seated in the new [[37th United States Congress|37th Congress]]. Mexican War hero [[Winfield Scott]] suggested to Lincoln that he assume the powers of a commander-in-chief before inauguration. However, historian Bruce Chadwick observes that Lincoln and his advisors ignored the widespread alarms and threats of secession as mere election trickery.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIndeed, voting in the South was not as monolithic as the Electoral College map would make it seem. Economically, culturally, and politically, the South was made up of three regions. In the states of the Upper South, also known as the [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border South]] (Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri), unionist popular votes were scattered among Lincoln, Douglas, and Bell, to form a majority in all four. In the Middle South states, there was a unionist majority divided between Douglas and Bell in Virginia and Tennessee; in North Carolina and Arkansas, the unionist (Bell and Douglas) vote approached a majority. Texas was the only Middle South state that Breckinridge carried convincingly. In three of the six Deep South states, unionists (Bell and Douglas) won divided majorities in Georgia and Louisiana or neared it in Alabama. Breckinridge convincingly carried only three of the six states of the Deep South (South Carolina, Florida, and Mississippi).<ref name=\"CameinSecond\">{{cite journal |last1=Hindley |first1=Meredith |title=The Man Who Came in Second |journal=Humanities |date=November–December 2010 |volume=31 |issue=6 |url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/novemberdecember/feature/the-man-who-came-in-second |access-date=13 March 2020}}</ref> These three Deep South states included the four Southern states with the largest enslaved populations, and consequently the smallest enfranchised free white populations; together, they held only nine percent of Southern whites.<ref>Freehling, William W., The Road to Disunion: Volume II.

Texas, with five percent of the total wartime South's population, voted 75 percent Breckinridge. Kentucky and Missouri, with one-fourth the total population, voted 73 percent pro-union Bell, Douglas and Lincoln. In comparison, the six states of the Deep South making up one-fourth the Confederate voting population, split 57 percent Breckinridge versus 43 percent for the two pro-union candidates.{{refn|\"Deep South\" here in presidential popular votes refers to Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.

Except in some border areas, the Republican party did not attempt any organization in the South and did not print ballots there because almost no one was willing to acknowledge publicly they were voting for Lincoln for fear of violent retribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/union_or_secession/doc/republican_ballot|title=Republican ballot 1860|access-date=2011-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://housedivided.dickinson.edu/sites/blogdivided/2010/07/19/election-of-1860-read-your-ballot|title=Election of 1860 – 'Read Your Ballot'|access-date=2011-04-28}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}\nwhere he received 1,929 votes (1.15 percent of the total).<ref name=HarpWeek/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiamemory.com/docs/1860_election_returns.pdf|title=1860 Election Returns in Virginia, by County|access-date=2011-04-28}}</ref> Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of the votes Lincoln received were cast in border counties of what would soon become [[West Virginia]] – the future state accounted for 1,832 of Lincoln's 1,929 votes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.virginiamemory.com/docs/1860_election_returns.pdf?_ga=1.106676996.686399364.1492562750|title=Results by county in Virginia}}</ref>\n\nLincoln received no votes at all in 121 of the state's then-145 counties (including 31 of the 50 that would form West Virginia), received a single vote in three counties and received ten or fewer votes in nine of the 24 counties where he polled votes. Lincoln's best results, by far, were in the four counties that comprised the state's [[Northern Panhandle of West Virginia|northern panhandle]], a region which had long felt alienated from Richmond, was economically and culturally linked to its neighbors Ohio and Pennsylvania and would become the key driver in the successful effort to form a separate state. [[Hancock County, West Virginia|Hancock County]] (Virginia's northernmost at the time) returned Lincoln's best result – he polled over 40% of the vote there and finished in second place (Lincoln polled only eight votes fewer than Breckinridge). Of the 97 votes cast for Lincoln in the state's post-1863 boundaries, 93 were polled in four counties along the [[Potomac River]] and four were tallied in the coastal city of [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]].<ref name=HarpWeek/>\n\nOne key difference between modern elections and those of the mid-nineteenth century is that at the time the state did not print and distribute ballots. In theory, any document containing a valid or at least non-excessive number names of citizens of a particular state (provided they were eligible to vote in the electoral college within that state) might have been accepted as a valid presidential ballot; however, what this meant in practice was that a candidate's campaign was responsible for printing and distributing their own ballots (this service was typically done by supportive newspaper publishers). Moreover, since voters did not choose the president directly, but rather presidential electors, the only way for a voter to meaningfully support a particular candidate for president was cast a ballot for citizens of his state who would have pledged to vote for the candidate in the Electoral College. In ten southern slave states, no citizen would publicly pledge to vote for Abraham Lincoln, so citizens there had no legal means to vote for the Republican nominee. In most of Virginia, no publisher would print ballots for Lincoln's pledged electors.<ref name=HarpWeek/> While a citizen without access to a ballot for Lincoln could theoretically have still voted for him by means of a [[write-in candidate|write-in ballot]] provided his state had electors pledged to Lincoln and the voter knew their identities, casting a ballot in favor of the Republican candidate in a strongly pro-slavery county would have incurred (at minimum) social ostracization (of course, casting a vote for Breckinridge in a strongly abolitionist county ran a voter the same risk).{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}\n\nIn the four slave states that did not secede (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware), Lincoln came in fourth in every state except Delaware (where he finished third). Within the fifteen slave states, Lincoln won only two counties out of 996, Missouri's [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Gasconade County, Missouri|Gasconade Counties]].<ref name=HarpWeek>{{cite web|url=http://elections.harpweek.com/1860/Overview-1860-2.htm  |title=HarpWeek 1860 Election Overview|access-date=2011-03-20}}</ref> In the 1856 election, the Republican candidate for president had received no votes at all in twelve of the fourteen slave states with a popular vote (these being the same states as in the 1860 election, plus Missouri and Virginia).\n\n==Results==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| caption_align = center\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n| image1    = LincolnInauguration1861a.jpg\n| width1    = 323\n| alt1      = the unfinished Capitol dome, 1860\n| caption1  = '''Inauguration''' of Abraham Lincoln<br />the Capitol, March 4, 1861\n| image2    = ElectoralCollege1860.svg\n| width2    = 220\n| alt2      = 1860 Electoral College map with 35 states\n| caption2  = state '''Election''' results<br />by Electoral College vote\n}}\n\nThe election was held on Tuesday, November 6, 1860, and was noteworthy for the exaggerated sectionalism and voter enthusiasm in a country that was soon to dissolve into civil war.

South Carolina had no popular vote.]]\n\nLincoln won the Electoral College with less than 40 percent of the popular vote nationwide by carrying states above the [[Mason–Dixon line]] and north of the Ohio River, plus the states of California and Oregon in the [[Western United States|Far West]]. Unlike every preceding president-elect, Lincoln did not carry even one slave state.\n\nThere were no ballots distributed for Lincoln in ten of the Southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.\nLincoln was therefore the second President-elect to poll no votes in some states which had a popular vote (the first was [[John Quincy Adams]], who polled no ballots in the popular votes of two states in the [[1824 United States presidential election|election of 1824]], the only other election in which there were four major candidates, none of whom distributed ballots in every state). It should be further noted that, prior to introduction of the [[secret ballot]] in the 1880s, the concept of [[ballot access]] did not exist in the sense it does today: there was no standardized state-issued ballot for a candidate to \"appear\" on. Instead, presidential ballots were printed and distributed by agents of the candidates and their parties, who organized slates of would-be electors publicly pledged to vote for a particular candidate. The 1824 and 1860 presidential elections were the only two prior to the introduction of the secret ballot where a winning candidate was so unpopular in a particular region that it was impossible to organize and print ballots for a slate of eligible voters pledged to vote for that candidate in an entire state.\n\nSince 1860, and excluding unreconstructed Southern states in 1868 and 1872, there have been two occasions where a Republican presidential candidate failed to poll votes in every state{{refn|In 1892, incumbent President [[Benjamin Harrison]] failed to poll votes [[1892 United States presidential election in Florida|in Florida]] because the state's Republicans supported [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] nominee [[James B.

In [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]], [[William Howard Taft]] was not on the ballot in [[1912 United States presidential election in South Dakota|South Dakota]] or California because the South Dakotan and Californian branches of Republican Party nominated Progressive candidate [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as the official Republican candidate.|group=\"nb\"}}, while national Democratic candidates have failed to appear on all state ballots in three elections since the introduction of the secret ballot, though in all three, the Democratic candidate nonetheless won the presidency {{refn|In [[1892 United States presidential election|1892]], [[Grover Cleveland]] was not on the ballot in [[1892 United States presidential election in Colorado|Colorado]], [[1892 United States presidential election in Idaho|Idaho]], [[1892 United States presidential election in Kansas|Kansas]], [[1892 United States presidential election in North Dakota|North Dakota]], or [[1892 United States presidential election in Wyoming|Wyoming]], while neither [[1948 United States presidential election in Alabama|Harry Truman in 1948]] nor [[1964 United States presidential election in Alabama|Lyndon Johnson in 1964]] were on the ballot in Alabama.|group=\"nb\"}}, but none of them were off the ballot in as many states as Lincoln in 1860.\n\nLincoln won the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|second-lowest share of the popular vote]] among all winning presidential candidates in U.S. history.{{refn|[[John Quincy Adams]], who won the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]] in a vote of the House of Representatives, won 30.92% of the popular vote, or 10.44% less than that of Andrew Jackson. Lincoln's share of the popular vote in 1860 represents the lowest share received by any popular vote winner.|group=\"nb\"}} Lincoln's share of the popular vote would likely have been even lower if there had been a popular vote in South Carolina, though conversely it would likely have been marginally higher had he been on the ballot in all of the Southern states. The Republican victory resulted from the concentration of votes in the free states, which together controlled a majority of the presidential electors.<ref>Chadwick, Bruce. \"Lincoln for President: an unlikely candidate, an audacious strategy, and the victory no one saw coming\" (2009) Ch. 10 ''The Eleventh Hour''. p. 289 {{ISBN|978-1-4022-2504-8}}</ref>\n\nLincoln's strategy was deliberately focused, in collaboration with Republican Party Chairman [[Thurlow Weed]], on expanding on the states Frémont won four years earlier: New York was critical with 35 Electoral College votes, 11.5 percent of the total, and with Pennsylvania (27) and Ohio (23) as well, a candidate could collect 85 votes, whereas 152 were required to win. The [[Wide Awakes]] young Republican men's organization massively expanded registered voter lists, and although Lincoln was not even on the ballot in most Southern states, population increases in the free states had far exceeded those seen in the slave states for many years before the election of 1860, hence free states dominated in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].<ref>Ziegler-McPherson, Christina A.; ''Selling America : Immigration Promotion and the Settlement of the American Continent, 1607-1914'', pp. 34-36 {{ISBN|1440842094}}</ref>\n\nThe split in the Democratic party is sometimes held responsible for Lincoln's victory<ref>''e.g.'', the 1912 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', vol, 15, p. 171</ref> despite the fact that Lincoln won the election with less than 40% of the popular vote, as much of the anti-Republican vote was \"wasted\" in Southern states in which no ballots for Lincoln were circulated. Lincoln also won outright majorities in enough states, that if he lost all states that he took with pluralities, he would still have enough electoral votes to win.\n\nAt most, a single opponent nationwide would have deprived Lincoln of only California, Oregon, and four New Jersey electors,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1892/12/26/archives/newjerseys-vote-in-1860-how-the-electoral-college-happened-to-be.html |title=New Jersey's Vote in 1860 |newspaper=NY Times |date=December 26, 1892}}</ref> whose combined total of eleven electoral votes would have made no difference to the result since every other state won by the Republicans was won by a clear majority of the vote: in this scenario, Lincoln would have received 169 electoral votes, 17 more than the 152 required to win.\n\nIn the four states of New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and New Jersey where anti-Lincoln votes were combined into [[1860 fusion ticket|fusion tickets]], Lincoln still won three and split New Jersey;<ref>Allan Nevins, ''The Emergence of Lincoln: Prologue to Civil War'' (1950), p. 312</ref> despite this, a shift of 25,000 votes to the fusion ticket in New York would have left Lincoln with 145 electoral votes - seven votes short of winning the Electoral College - and forced a contingent election in the House of Representatives.<ref>Potter, ''The impending crisis, 1848–1861'' (1976) p. 437</ref><ref>Luthin, ''The First Lincoln Campaign'' p. 227</ref> Of the five states that Lincoln failed to carry despite polling votes, he received 20 percent of the vote in only one (Delaware), and 10 percent of the vote in only one more (Missouri).\n\nLike Lincoln, Breckinridge and Bell won no electoral votes outside of their respective sections. While Bell retired to his family business, quietly supporting his state's secession, Breckinridge served as a Confederate general. He finished second in the Electoral College with 72 votes, carrying eleven of fifteen slave states (including South Carolina, whose electors were chosen by the state legislature, not popular vote). Breckinridge stood a distant third in national popular vote at eighteen percent, but accrued 50 to 75 percent in the first seven states that would form the [[Confederate States of America]]. He took nine of the eleven states that eventually joined, plus the border slave states of Delaware and Maryland, losing only Virginia and Tennessee. Breckinridge received very little support in the free states, showing some strength only in California, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.\n\nBell carried three slave states (Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia) and lost Maryland by only 722 votes. Nevertheless, he finished a remarkable second in all slave states won by Breckinridge or Douglas. He won 45 to 47 percent in Maryland, Tennessee and North Carolina and canvassed respectably with 36 to 40 percent in Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida. Bell himself had hoped that he would take over the former support of the extinct [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in free states, but the majority of this support went to Lincoln.<ref name=\"Ballot\">Davies, Gareth and Zelizer, Julian E.; ''America at the Ballot Box: Elections and Political History'', pp. 65-66 {{ISBN|0812291360}}</ref> Thus, except for running mate Everett's home state of Massachusetts, and California, Bell received even less support in the free states than did Breckinridge, and consequently came in last in the national popular vote, at 12.62%.\n\nDouglas was the only candidate who won electoral votes in both slave and free states (free New Jersey and slave Missouri). His support was the most widespread geographically; he finished second behind Lincoln in the popular vote with 29.52%, but last in the Electoral College. His 12 electoral votes are the lowest for a Democrat in history. Douglas attained a 28 to 47% share in the states of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Trans-Mississippi West, but slipped to 19 to 39% in New England. Outside his regional section, Douglas took 15 to 17% of the popular vote total in the slave states of Kentucky, Alabama, and Louisiana, then 10 percent or less in the nine remaining slave states. Douglas, in his \"Norfolk Doctrine\", reiterated in North Carolina, promised to keep the Union together by coercion if states proceeded to secede: the popular vote for Lincoln and Douglas combined was 69.17% of the turnout.\n\nThe 1860 Republican ticket was the first successful national ticket that did not feature a Southerner, and the election marked the end of Southern political dominance in the United States. Between 1789 and 1860, Southerners had been president for two-thirds of the era, and had held the offices of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tem of the Senate]] during much of that time. Moreover, since 1791, Southerners had comprised a majority of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Liberty Equality Power: A History of the American People, Volume I: To 1877| page=403| edition=6th| last1=Murrin| first1=John M.| last2=Johnson| first2=Paul E.| last3=McPherson| first3=James M.| last4=Fahs| first4=Alice| last5=Gerstle| first5=Gary| last6=Rosenberg| first6=Emily S.| last7=Rosenberg| first7=Norman L. |publisher= Wadsworth, Cengage Learning |location=Boston| isbn=978-0-495-91587-4| date=January 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File: United States Electoral College 1860.svg]]\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=<sup>(a)</sup>|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Abraham Lincoln]]|vp_name=[[Hannibal Hamlin]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[Illinois]]|vp_state=[[Maine]]|pv=1,865,908|pv_pct=39.82%|ev=180}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[John C.

They then formed the [[Confederate States of America]]. On 9 February 1861, [[Jefferson Davis]] was [[1861 Confederate States presidential election|elected president of the Confederacy]].\n\nSeveral other states also considered declaring secession at the time:\n\n* Missouri convened a secession convention, which voted against secession and adjourned permanently.\n* Arkansas convened a secession convention, which voted against secession and adjourned temporarily.<ref>[https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/secession-convention-6304/ Secession Convention] ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas''</ref>\n* Virginia convened a secession convention, which voted against secession but remained in session.\n* Tennessee held a referendum on having a secession convention, which failed.\n* North Carolina held a referendum on having a secession convention, which failed.<ref>[https://www.ncdcr.gov/blog/2015/05/20/secession-vote-and-realigned-allegiance Secession Vote and Realigned Allegiance] North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources</ref>\n\nAll of the secessionist activity was motivated by fear for the institution of slavery in the South. If the President (and, by extension, the appointed federal officials in the South, such as district attorneys, marshals, postmasters, and judges) opposed slavery, it might collapse. There were fears that abolitionist agents would infiltrate the South and foment slave insurrections. (The noted secessionist [[William Lowndes Yancey]], speaking at New York's Cooper Institute in October 1860, asserted that with abolitionists in power, \"Emissaries will percolate between master [and] slave as water between the crevices of rocks underground. They will be found everywhere, with [[strychnine]] to put in our wells.\"<ref>{{cite book | author=Walther, Eric H. | year=2006 | title=William Lowndes Yancey: The Coming of the Civil War | isbn=978-0-7394-8030-4 |page=262}}</ref>) Less radical Southerners thought that with Northern antislavery dominance of the federal government, slavery would eventually be abolished, regardless of present constitutional limits.<ref>[[Avery Craven]], [http://lsupress.org/books/detail/the-growth-of-southern-nationalism-1848-1861/ ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism, 1848–1861''], 1953. {{ISBN|978-0-8071-0006-6}}, p. 391, 394, 396.</ref>\n\nBertram Wyatt-Brown argues that secessionists desired independence as necessary for their honor. They could no longer tolerate Northern state attitudes that regarded slave ownership as a great sin and Northern politicians who insisted on stopping the spread of slavery.<ref>{{cite book |first=Mary A. |last=Decredico |chapter=Sectionalism and the Secession Crisis |editor-first=John B. |editor-last=Boles |title=A Companion to the American South |year=2004 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vANndXTE8g4C&pg=PA243 |page=243 |isbn=9781405138307 }}</ref><ref>Wyatt-Brown, Bertram.

However, the \"conditional Unionists\" also hoped that when faced with secession, Northerners would stifle anti-slavery rhetoric and accept pro-slavery rules for the territories. It was that group that prevented immediate secession in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas when\nLincoln took office on 4 March 1861. He took no action against the secessionists in the seven \"Confederate\" states but also declared that secession had no legal validity and refused to surrender federal property in those states. (He also reiterated his opposition to slavery anywhere in the territories.) Preparing to form an army, on 6 March 1861 Davis called for 100,000 volunteers to serve for twelve months.<ref>\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161021171757/http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH/AMH-09.htm The Civil War, 1861\".

Retrieved 3 July 2023.</ref> The political standoff continued until mid-April, when Davis ordered Confederate troops to bombard and capture [[Fort Sumter]].\n\nLincoln then [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|called for troops to put down rebellion]], which wiped out the possibility that the crisis could be resolved by compromise.

Garfield]] defeated [[Winfield Scott Hancock]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The voter turnout rate was one of the highest in the nation's history. Garfield was [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|assassinated]] during his first year in office, and he was succeeded by his vice president, [[Chester A. Arthur]].\n\nIncumbent President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] did not seek re-election. After the longest convention in the party's history, the factionalized Republicans chose Representative Garfield of [[Ohio]] as their standard-bearer. The Democratic Party chose General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]] of [[Pennsylvania]] as their nominee. The dominance of the two major parties began to fray as an upstart left-wing party, the [[Greenback Party]], nominated another Civil War general for president, Iowa Congressman [[James B. Weaver]]. In a campaign fought mainly over issues of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] loyalties, [[tariff in United States history|tariffs]], and [[History of Chinese Americans|Chinese immigration]], Garfield narrowly won both the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral]] and popular vote. He and Hancock each took just over 48 percent of the popular vote, while Weaver and two other minor candidates, [[Neal Dow]] and [[John W. Phelps]], together made up the remainder.\n\nIn the end, the popular vote totals of the two main candidates were separated by 1,898 votes (0.11%), the smallest [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|victory in the national popular vote]] ever recorded. In the electoral college, however, Garfield's victory was much larger; he won the [[Tipping-point state|tipping point state]] of New York by 21,033 votes (1.91%). Hancock's sweep of the Southern states was not enough for victory, but it cemented [[Solid South|his party's dominance of the region for generations]]. \n\nThis was the last of six consecutive presidential election victories for the Republican Party. It was also the first in which people in every state were able to vote directly for presidential electors.{{efn|In 1876, Colorado appointed electors by state legislature due to insufficient time to organize an election. From 1864–1872, some states did not choose electors due to the Civil War or Reconstruction. Before then, some states gave the choice of electors to the state legislature, including South Carolina which used the system up through 1860.}}\n\n==Background==\nThe two major parties were the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], and after the end of the [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]] in 1877, the national electorate was closely divided between them.{{sfn|Kleppner|1979|pp=298–299}} Party membership was only partly based on ideology; party identification often reflected ethnic and religious background, as well as Civil War loyalties that were still keenly felt by many voters.{{sfn|Kleppner|1979|p=144}} Most Northern [[Protestantism|Protestants]] voted Republican, as did black Southerners. On the other hand, white Southerners and Northern [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] generally voted Democratic.{{efn|These sectarian divisions were far from absolute. For more detail, see [[Third Party System|Third party system]].}}{{sfn|Kleppner|1979|pp=180–197}}\n\n===Issues===\nThe [[gold standard]] and the [[Tariff in United States history|tariff tax on imports]] divided the major parties.{{sfn|Wiebe|1967|pp=31–37}} The monetary debate was over the basis for the value of the United States dollar. Nothing but gold and silver coin had ever been legal tender in the United States until the Civil War, when the mounting costs of the war forced the [[United States Congress]] to issue \"[[united States Note|greenbacks]]\" (dollar bills backed by government bonds).{{sfn|Unger|1964|pp=14–16}} Greenbacks helped pay for the war, but resulted in severe [[inflation]] .{{sfn|Unger|1964|pp=14–16}} After the war, bondholders and other creditors (based in the North) wanted to return to a gold standard. At the same time, debtors (especially in the South and West) benefited from the way inflation reduced the real value of their debts, and workers and some businessmen liked the way inflation made for easy credit.{{sfn|Unger|1964|pp=43–67}} The issue cut across parties, producing dissension among Republicans and Democrats alike and spawning a third party, the [[Greenback Party]], in 1876, when both major parties nominated \"hard money\" candidates (i.e., candidates who favored the gold-backed currency instead of \"soft money\" greenbacks that generated inflation). Monetary debate intensified as Congress effectively [[Coinage Act of 1873|demonetized silver in 1873]] and began redeeming greenbacks in gold by 1879, while limiting their circulation.{{sfn|Wiebe|1967|p=6}} As the 1880 election season began, the nation's money was backed by gold alone, but the issue was far from settled.{{sfn|Unger|1964|pp=374–407}}\n\nTariff policy was a major source of party conflict in late 19th-century and early 20th century. During the Civil War, Congress raised protective tariffs to new heights. This was done partly to pay for the war, but partly because high tariffs were popular in the North. A high tariff meant that foreign goods were more expensive, which made it easier for American businesses to sell goods domestically.{{sfn|Peskin|1980|pp=175–176}} Republicans [[Protectionism|supported high tariffs]] as a way to protect American jobs and increase prosperity.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|p=297}} Democrats condemned them as a source of higher prices for goods, whereas the higher revenues that they generated for the federal government were not needed after the conclusion of the Civil War.{{sfn|Peskin|1980|pp=175–176}} However Northern Democrats from manufacturing districts, especially in Pennsylvania, also supported high tariffs. In the interest of party unity, the leaders of each party often sought to avoid the question as much as possible.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|p=297}}\n\n===1876 election===\nIn the [[1876 United States presidential election|election of 1876]], Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat [[Samuel J. Tilden]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] in one of the most hotly contested presidential elections in the nation's history.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=17–21}} The early results indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several Southern states were disputed bitterly. Both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]], which ultimately decided the race for Hayes.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=17–21}}\n\nFor Democrats, the \"stolen election\" became a rallying cry, and the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives spent much of 1878 investigating it, although they failed to turn up any new evidence against their Republican foes.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=52–55}} At first, Tilden was seen as the front-runner for the 1880 nomination.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=52–55}} For leading Republicans, Hayes's inauguration in 1877 signaled the start of backroom maneuverings for the nomination in 1880.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=22–23}} Even before his election, Hayes had pledged not to run for a second term, leaving the path to the White House open in 1880.{{sfn|Hoogenboom|1995|pp=266–267}} His cabinet selections alienated many party leaders as well, deepening the growing divide within the Republican party between forces loyal to New York Senator [[Roscoe Conkling]] and those loyal to Maine Senator [[James G. Blaine]].{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=22–23}}\n\n==Conventions==\nThe parties agreed on their respective [[Party platform|platforms]] and nominees at [[United States presidential nominating convention|conventions]], which met in the summer before the election.\n\n=== Republicans ===\n{{main|1880 Republican National Convention}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Republican Disc.svg|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''1880 Republican Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[James A.

Hayes]], the incumbent president in 1880, whose term expired on March 4, 1881]]\nThe Republican convention met first, convening in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], on June 2. Of the men vying for the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates leading up to the convention were former president [[Ulysses S. Grant]], Senator James G. Blaine and Treasury Secretary [[John Sherman]].{{sfn|Doenecke|1981|pp=17–19}} Grant had been the leading military commander for the Northern forces during the Civil War, and had served two terms as president from 1869 to 1877. He was seeking an unprecedented third term in the office. He was backed by Conkling's faction of the Republican Party, now known as the [[Stalwarts (politics)|Stalwarts]].{{sfn|Peskin|1980|p=178}} They were mainly known for their opposition to the [[civil service]] reforms sought by President Hayes. Blaine, a senator and former representative from Maine, was backed by the [[Half-Breeds (politics)|Half-Breed]] faction of the party, which did support civil service reform.{{sfn|Peskin|1980|p=179}} Sherman, the brother of Civil War general [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], was a former senator from Ohio serving in Hayes's cabinet. He was backed by a smaller delegation that supported neither of the major factions.\n\nOn the first ballot, Grant and Blaine gleaned 304 and 285 votes, respectively, while Sherman received 93.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=479–481}} None of the candidates were close to victory, and the balloting continued in order to determine a winner.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=96–101}} Many more ballots were taken, but no candidate prevailed. After the thirty-fifth ballot, Blaine and Sherman delegates switched their support to the new \"dark horse\" candidate, Representative James A. Garfield from Ohio.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=110–114}} On the next ballot, Garfield won the nomination when he received 399 votes, most of them former Blaine and Sherman delegates. To placate the Grant faction, Garfield's Ohio supporters suggested [[Levi P. Morton]] for vice president. Morton declined, based on Conkling's advice. They next offered the nomination to [[Chester A. Arthur]], another New York Stalwart. Conkling also advised him to decline, but he accepted. He was nominated, and the longest-ever Republican National Convention was adjourned on June 8, 1880.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=480–481}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\" classes=\"center\">\nFile:Grant circa 1880 crop.jpg|[[Ulysses S.

Six men were officially candidates for nomination at the convention, and several others also received votes. Of these, the two leading candidates were Major General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]] from Pennsylvania and Senator [[Thomas F. Bayard]] from Delaware. Tilden was not officially a candidate, but he wielded a heavy influence over the convention. Tilden was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign, leading some delegates to defect to other candidates, while others stayed loyal to their old standard-bearer.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=70–75, 124–126}}\n\nAs the convention opened, some delegates favored Bayard, a conservative senator, while others supported Hancock, a career soldier and Civil War hero. Still others flocked to men they saw as surrogates for Tilden, including [[Henry B. Payne]] from Ohio, an attorney and former congressman, and [[Samuel J. Randall]] from Pennsylvania, the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Clancy|1958|p=138}} The first round of balloting was inconclusive, with Hancock and Bayard leading the count. Before the second round, Tilden's withdrawal from the campaign became known for certain; delegates then shifted to Hancock, who was nominated.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|p=139}} [[William Hayden English]], a conservative politician and businessman from the [[swing state]] of [[Indiana]], was nominated for vice president.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|p=281}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\" classes=\"center\">\nFile:Winfield Scott Hancock - Brady-Handy.jpg|[[Winfield Scott Hancock]] (U.S. Major General)\nFile:Thomas F.

[[James B. Weaver]], an Iowa congressman and Civil War general, was the clear favorite, but two other congressmen, [[Benjamin Butler|Benjamin F. Butler]] from Massachusetts and [[Hendrick Bradley Wright|Hendrick B. Wright]] from Pennsylvania, also commanded considerable followings. Weaver triumphed quickly, winning a majority of the 850 delegates' votes on the first ballot.{{sfn|Lause|2001|p=81}} [[Barzillai J. Chambers]], a Texas businessman and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veteran, was likewise nominated for vice president on the initial vote.{{sfn|Lause|2001|p=81}} More tumultuous was the fight over the platform, as delegates from disparate factions of the left-wing movement clashed over [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]], [[History of Chinese Americans|Chinese immigration]], and the extent to which the government should regulate working conditions.{{sfn|Lause|2001|p=82}}\n\nA convention of the [[Prohibition Party]] also met that month in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]].{{sfn|Clancy|1958|p=164}} The Prohibitionists, more of a movement than a party, focused their efforts on [[Prohibition in the United States|banning alcohol]].{{sfn|Kleppner|1979|pp=252–255}} Most party members came from [[Pietism|pietist]] churches, and most were former Republicans.{{sfn|Kleppner|1979|pp=252–255}} Only twelve states sent delegates to the convention, and the platform they agreed on was silent on most issues of the day, focusing instead on the evils of alcohol.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|p=164}} For president, the Prohibitionists nominated [[Neal Dow]], a Civil War general from Maine.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|p=165}} As mayor of [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], Dow helped to pass the \"[[Maine law]]\", which banned the sale of alcohol in the city; it became the model for temperance laws around the country.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|p=165}} Finally, a revived [[Anti-Masonic Party#Second Anti-Masonic Party|Anti-Masonic Party]] nominated [[John W. Phelps]], another Civil War general, on a platform of opposition to [[Freemasonry]].{{sfn|Clancy|1958|p=165}} Political prognosticators gave Weaver little chance of victory, and Dow and Phelps none at all.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|p=166}}\n\n==Candidates==\n\n=== Garfield ===\n[[File:1880RepublicanPoster.png|thumb|Garfield–Arthur election poster]]\nJames Abram Garfield was raised in humble circumstances on an Ohio farm by his widowed mother. He worked at various jobs, including on a [[Barge|canal boat]], in his youth.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=4–12}} Beginning at age 17, he studied at [[Williams College]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], from which he graduated in 1856.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=33–46}} A year later, Garfield entered politics as a Republican. He married [[Lucretia Garfield|Lucretia Rudolph]] in 1858, and served as a member of the [[Ohio Senate|Ohio State Senate]] (1859–1861).{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=55–61}} Garfield opposed Confederate secession, served as a major general in the [[Union Army]] during the Civil War, and fought in the battles of [[Battle of Middle Creek|Middle Creek]], [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], and [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=86–220}} He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent [[Ohio's 19th congressional district|Ohio's 19th District]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=146–148}} Throughout Garfield's extended congressional service after the Civil War, he firmly supported the gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=261–268}} Garfield initially agreed with [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican]] views regarding [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]], but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for [[Freedman|freedmen]].{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=251–260}}\n\nAfter his nomination, Garfield met with party leaders in an attempt to heal the schism between the Stalwarts and Half-Breeds.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=488–489}} In his formal letter to the party accepting his nomination, written with advice from party leaders, he endorsed the ideas of high tariffs and sound money, but drew particular attention to the issues of Chinese immigration and civil service reform.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=482–483}} On both, Garfield sought a moderate path. He called for some restrictions on the former, through treaty renegotiation with the Chinese government.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=482–483}} He straddled the divide on civil service reform, saying that he agreed with the concept, while promising to make no appointments without consulting party leaders, a position 20th-century biographer Allan Peskin called \"inconsistent\".{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=483–484}} As was traditional at the time, Garfield conducted a \"[[front porch campaign]]\", returning to [[James A. Garfield National Historic Site|his home]] for the duration of the contest, and leaving the actual campaigning to surrogates.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=498–500}}\n\n=== Hancock ===\n[[File:1880DemocraticCampaignPoster.png|thumb|Hancock–English election poster]]\nWinfield Scott Hancock was born and raised in Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|p=5}} He attended the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point and served in the Army for four decades, including service in the [[Mexican–American War]] and as a Union general in the Civil War. Known to his Army colleagues as \"Hancock the Superb\", he was noted in particular for his personal leadership at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863, where he led the defense of [[Pickett's Charge]], getting wounded in the process. His military service continued after the Civil War, as Hancock participated in the military Reconstruction of [[Southern United States|the South]] and the Army's presence at the Western [[Frontier#United States|frontier]]. During Reconstruction, he sided with then-President [[Andrew Johnson]] in working for a quick end to military occupation of the South and a return to government by the pre-war establishment.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|pp=203–212}} Hancock's reputation as a war hero at Gettysburg, combined with his status as a prominent Democrat with impeccable Unionist credentials and pro-states' rights views, made him a quadrennial presidential possibility.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=68–70}}\n\nHancock was officially notified of his nomination in July, and responded with the traditional letter of acceptance.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|pp=287–292}} As Garfield had, the Democratic nominee sought to cause no controversy in his statement, which according to biographer David M. Jordan was \"bland and general\".{{sfn|Jordan|1996|pp=287–292}} After scorning the previous years of Republican rule, Hancock sought to tamp down fears that election of a Democrat would overturn the results of the war and Reconstruction, a common Republican campaign theme.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|pp=282–293}} Unlike Garfield, Hancock had no record in elected office, but the acceptance letter gave no further indication of his political preferences.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|pp=282–293}} Hancock remained on active duty during the campaign at his post on [[Governors Island]] in [[New York Harbor]].{{sfn|Jordan|1996|p=288}}\n\n===Weaver===\n[[File:Weaver-Chambers 1880.jpg|upright|thumb|Weaver–Chambers campaign ribbon]]\nJames Baird Weaver was born in Ohio, and moved to Iowa as a boy when his family claimed a [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] on the frontier.{{sfn|Mitchell|2008|pp=7–31}} He became politically active as a young man and was an advocate for farmers and laborers, joining and quitting several political parties in the furtherance of the progressive causes in which he believed. After serving in the Union Army in the Civil War, Weaver returned to Iowa and worked for the election of Republican candidates.{{sfn|Mitchell|2008|pp=55–59}} After making several unsuccessful attempts at Republican nominations to various offices, and growing dissatisfied with the conservative wing of the party, in 1877 Weaver switched to the Greenback Party, advocating an increased money supply and stricter regulation of [[big business]].{{sfn|Mitchell|2008|pp=68–74}} As a Greenbacker with Democratic support, Weaver won election to the House of Representatives in 1878.{{sfn|Mitchell|2008|pp=68–74}}\n\nUnlike the major party candidates, Weaver planned to take the field himself, giving speeches around the country.{{sfn|Mitchell|2008|pp=102–103}} His running mate, Chambers, was to do the same, until a fall from a train in July disabled him for the duration of the campaign.{{sfn|Barr|1967|p=282}} As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, he hoped to make inroads in that region.{{sfn|Lause|2001|pp=85–104}} Weaver's path to victory, already unlikely, was made more difficult by his refusal to run a [[Electoral fusion|fusion]] ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.{{sfn|Lause|2001|pp=124–146}} His party's message of racial inclusion also presaged difficulty in the South, as the Greenbackers would face the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement.{{sfn|Lause|2001|pp=105–124}}\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Only waiting for the signal.jpg|thumb|left|A cartoon from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' suggests that defeated Confederates will overturn the results of the Civil War should Hancock be elected.]]\n\n===Bloody shirt===\nHancock and the Democrats expected to carry the [[Solid South]], while much of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states, including New York and Indiana. National elections were largely decided in close elections in New York and the Midwest. Practical differences between the major party candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of \"[[waving the bloody shirt]]\", reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=175–180}} With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets, the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=493–494}}\n\nThe Democrats, for their part, campaigned on the character of the candidates. They attacked Garfield for his connection with the [[Crédit Mobilier scandal|Crédit Mobilier of America scandal]] of the early 1870s, in which many members of Congress were bribed by the Crédit Mobilier corporation, a railroad construction company.{{sfn|Cherny|1997|p=67}} Garfield's precise involvement was unknown, but modern biographers agree that his account of his dealings with the construction syndicate were less than perfectly honest.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=354–362}} Democrats used the incident as a contrast with Hancock who, as a career army officer, stood apart from Congress and lobbyists. Many in the Republican Party were reluctant to directly criticize the \"hero of Gettysburg\", but they did characterize Hancock as uninformed on the issues, and some of his former comrades-in-arms gave critical speeches regarding his character.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=201–204}} Democrats never made clear what about their victory would improve the nation; Jordan later characterized their message as simply \"our man is better than your man\".{{sfn|Jordan|1996|p=297}}\n\nThe Greenbackers saw the impact of Civil War loyalties more acutely as they vied for Southern votes. Weaver embarked on a speaking tour of the South in July and August. Although the local Greenback parties had seen some recent success, the national party, with an ex-Republican Union general at the head of the ticket, faced more opposition.{{sfn|Lause|2001|pp=105–124}} The party's courtship of black voters, too, threatened the white Democratic establishment, leading to violent outbursts at Weaver's rallies and threats against his supporters.{{sfn|Lause|2001|pp=105–124}} As Weaver campaigned in the North in September and October, Republicans accused him of purposely dividing the vote to help Democrats win a plurality in marginal states.{{sfn|Lause|2001|pp=124–146}}  Weaver refused to cooperate with Democrats in running fusion slates of presidential electors. However, in state-level races, Greenback candidates did often combine with Democrats to defeat Republican candidates.{{sfn|Lause|2001|pp=124–146}} In the September [[1880 Maine gubernatorial election|gubernatorial race in Maine]], one such fusion ticket nominated [[Harris M. Plaisted]], who narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican in what was thought to be a safe state for that party.{{efn|Several states in those days held elections for state-level offices months before the federal elections in November. Maine's, in particular, were often considered [[As Maine goes, so goes the nation|harbingers of nationwide trends]].{{sfn|Jordan|1996|p=296}}}}{{sfn|Lause|2001|p=153}} The surprise defeat sent a shock through the Garfield campaign, and caused them to rethink their strategy of waving the bloody shirt.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=196–197}}\n\n===Tariffs and immigration===\n[[File:A local question.jpg|thumb|Hancock's blunder about tariffs may have harmed his standing with Northern industrial workers.]]\nAfter their defeat in Maine, the Republicans began to emphasize policy differences more. One significant difference between them and the Democrats was the plank in the Democratic platform endorsing \"a [[tariff in United States history|tariff]] for revenue only\". That is the tariff would only be used to cover the costs of the federal government, and not be raised higher to help specific industries.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|p=297}} Garfield's campaigners used this statement to paint the Democrats as unsympathetic to the plight of industrial laborers, a group that benefited from a high protective tariff. The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states, which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|pp=297–301}} Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said \"the tariff question is a local question\".{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=493–494}} While not completely inaccurate—tariff preferences often reflected local concerns—the statement was at odds with the Democrats' platform and suggested that Hancock did not understand the issue.{{sfn|Cherny|1997|p=67}}\n\nThe change in tactics appeared to be effective, as October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about their chances the following month.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|pp=297–301}} Democratic party leaders had selected English as Hancock's running mate because of his popularity in Indiana. With their state-level defeat there, some talked of dropping English from the ticket, but he convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November.{{sfn|Jordan|1996|pp=297–301}}\n\nIn the last weeks before the election, the issue of Chinese immigration entered the race. Both major parties (as well as the Greenbackers) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which native-born workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages. On October 20, however, a Democratic newspaper [[Morey letter|published a letter]], purportedly from Garfield to a group of businessmen, pledging to keep immigration at the current levels so that industry could keep workers' wages low.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=506–507}} Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon.{{sfn|Hinckley|1980|p=392}} Once the letter was exposed as a forgery, Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the Republican in the East, but it likely weakened him in the West.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=507–510}}\n\n==Results==\nThe extremely close election, with very high turnout, reflected the typical pattern of the Gilded Age. Democrats were assured of a Solid South electoral vote, as well as most of the border states. Republicans captured the Northeast and Midwest, winning the critical swing states of New York, Ohio and Indiana. The Republicans captured the electoral vote 214–155, but the popular vote margin was under 2000 out of over 9 million votes cast. Republicans won the House of Representatives 147–135, but the Senate was evenly split, with the vice president casting the deciding vote.{{sfn|Doenecke|2003|p=386}}\n\nWhen all the ballots were counted, fewer than 2,000 votes separated Garfield and Hancock, the closest popular vote of any American presidential election before or since.{{efn|name=popvote|There is considerable disagreement among historians about the exact vote totals. As Kenneth Ackerman explained in his 2003 book: \"Because (a) voting was decentralized, (b) states certified electoral votes, not popular votes as 'official', and (c) Democratic votes were divided among various splinter groups, there remains today a range of published 'final results' for the 1880 presidential popular vote.\"{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=220n}} The federal government lists the margin of victory as 1,898, which is used in this article.{{sfn|NARA 2012}} Others give the margin as 7,018;{{sfn|Clancy|1958|p=242}}{{sfn|Jordan|1996|p=306}} 7,368;{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=510}} 9,070;{{sfn|Burnham|1955|pp=247–257}} or 9,457{{sfn|Petersen|1963|p=49}} among others.}}{{sfn|NARA 2012}} The voters showed their interest in the election by turning out in record numbers; 78 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot, among largest percentages in American history.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=512}} Each major party candidate earned just over 48 percent of the vote. Weaver won more than 3 percent, tripling the Greenback total of four years earlier. The other minor party candidates fared far worse, as Dow and Phelps earned 0.1 and 0.01 percent, respectively.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|p=243}} Garfield carried the crucial state of New York by 20,000 votes out of 1.1 million cast there.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=220}} Other states were much closer; Hancock's margin of victory in California was only about 144 votes.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=511}}{{efn|name=popvote}}\nIn the [[united States Electoral College|electoral college]], the vote was more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]], but Garfield swept all but one of the Northern states (the exception was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes).{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=511}} Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield's triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=511}} The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|p=512}}{{sfn|Cherny|1997|p=68}} Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a Republican majority in the electoral college.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|p=243}} Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.{{sfn|Clancy|1958|pp=243–246}}\n\nCalifornia voted for a losing Democrat for the first time ever, which would not occur again until 2000. Republicans would not win without New Jersey and Delaware until 2000. Nevada also voted for a losing Democrat for the first time. \n\n===Irregularities===\nIn Virginia, a split in the Democratic Party over the payment of state debts led to two Democratic electoral slates being nominated, one by the regular debt-paying \"Funder\" Democrats, the other by the \"[[Readjuster Party|Readjuster]]\" or anti-debt paying faction of the party.{{sfn|Moore|1974|pp=74–75}} Both slates were pledged to the Hancock ticket. Republicans initially hoped the split could lead Garfield to win the state, but the results were otherwise. The Readjuster ticket received 31,527 votes, but the Funder Democrats took 96,449 votes, enough to defeat the Republicans, whose slate had 84,020.{{sfn|Moore|1974|p=76}}\n\nAlthough Hancock won Georgia's popular vote easily, there was an irregularity in that state's electoral votes. According to Article II, Section 1, clause 3 of the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], \"The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.\" In 1792, Congress had set the date for the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] to vote on the first Wednesday in December, which in 1880 fell on December 1. However, Georgia's electors failed to cast their ballots on December 1, instead voting on the following Wednesday, December 8.{{sfn|NARA 2012}} Congress chose to count Georgia's vote in the official tally anyway; had they not done so, Hancock's electoral vote would have been 144, not 155.{{sfn|NARA 2012}}\n\n===Detailed results===\n\n[[File: United States Electoral College 1880.svg]]\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote={{sfn|Petersen|1963|p=49}}|ev_footnote={{sfn|NARA 2012}}}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[James A.

Arthur by Ole Peter Hansen Balling.JPG|thumb|Chester Arthur succeeded to the presidency upon [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|Garfield's 1881 assassination]].]]\nAs Garfield entered office in March 1881, the Republican party schism that had been patched up for the election tore apart once more. Garfield appointed Blaine to the cabinet, and Conkling's Stalwart faction became irked at their lack of control over patronage, even in Conkling's home state of New York.{{sfn|Cherny|1997|p=68}} Garfield appointed [[William H. Robertson]], a civil service reform supporter, to the most lucrative government post in New York, and refused to withdraw the nomination despite Conkling's protests; in response, Conkling and his allies brought all legislative action in the closely divided Senate to a halt.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=559–572}} In May, Conkling and fellow New York Senator [[Thomas C. Platt]] resigned from the Senate in protest.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=559–572}} The two Stalwarts expected the New York legislature to reelect them in triumph; instead, the legislature deadlocked for months, eventually declining to return either man to the Senate.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=368–370, 432–433}} Before that result was known, however, [[Charles J. Guiteau|Charles Guiteau]], a mentally unstable man angry about not receiving a patronage appointment, shot Garfield in Washington, D.C., on July 2, 1881.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|pp=335–340}}\n\nGarfield lingered for {{frac|2|1|2}} months before dying on September 19, 1881.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=604–608}} Vice President Chester A. Arthur, the New York Stalwart, was sworn in as president that night.{{sfn|Peskin|1978|pp=604–608}} Garfield's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation to reform the civil service—and Arthur, erstwhile member of the Conkling machine, joined the cause.{{sfn|Cherny|1997|p=70}} In 1883, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] to reform the worst of the office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.{{sfn|Cherny|1997|p=73}}\n\nCongress also settled the issue of Chinese immigration, passing the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] in 1882. Arthur initially vetoed a similar measure, which he believed contradicted the United States' treaty with China, but eventually signed a compromise bill, which banned immigration from China for ten years.{{sfn|Reeves|1975|pp=278–279}} Tariffs, a major issue in the campaign, remained largely unchanged in the four years that followed, although Congress did pass [[Tariff of 1883|a minor revision]] that reduced them by an average of less than 2 percent.{{sfn|Reeves|1975|pp=330–335}} After a half-hearted attempt at the nomination in 1884, Arthur retired and died two years later.{{sfn|Reeves|1975|pp=368–418}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[American election campaigns in the 19th century]]\n* [[History of the United States (1865–1918)]]\n* [[Inauguration of James A.

In a re-match of the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896]] race, incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]] defeated his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger, [[William Jennings Bryan]]. McKinley's victory made him the first president to win a consecutive re-election since [[Ulysses S. Grant]] accomplished the same feat in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]]. Until [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], this would be the last time in which an incumbent Republican president would win re-election after serving a full term in office. This election saw the fifth rematch in presidential history, something that would also not occur again until 1956. This was also the first rematch to produce the same winner both times.\n\nMcKinley and Bryan each faced little opposition within their own parties. Although some [[National Democratic Party (United States)|Gold Democrats]] explored the possibility of a campaign by Admiral [[George Dewey]], Bryan was easily re-nominated at the [[1900 Democratic National Convention]] after Dewey withdrew from the race. McKinley was unanimously re-nominated at the [[1900 Republican National Convention]]. As Vice President [[Garret Hobart]] had died in 1899, the Republican convention chose New York Governor [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as McKinley's running mate.\n\nThe return of economic prosperity and recent victory in the [[Spanish–American War]] helped McKinley to score a decisive victory, while Bryan's [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] stance and continued support for [[bimetallism]] attracted only limited support. McKinley carried most states outside of the [[Solid South]] and won 51.6% of the popular vote. The election results were similar to those of 1896, though McKinley picked up several Western states and Bryan picked up Kentucky.\n\nSix months into his second term, McKinley was [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinated]] and was succeeded by his vice president, Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n==Nominations==\n\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{Main|1900 Republican National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Republican Disc.svg|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''1900 Republican Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[William McKinley|{{color|white|William McKinley}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[Theodore Roosevelt|{{color|white|Theodore Roosevelt}}]]\n|-  style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#FFD0D7;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:Mckinley.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n| [[File:Col.

[[Thomas C. Platt]], the \"boss\" of the New York State Republican Party, did not like [[Theodore Roosevelt]], New York's popular governor, even though he was a fellow Republican. Roosevelt's efforts to reform New York politics – including Republican politics – led Platt and other state Republican leaders to pressure President McKinley to accept Roosevelt as his new vice presidential candidate, thus filling the spot left open when Vice President [[Garret Hobart]] died in 1899. By electing Roosevelt vice president, Platt would remove Roosevelt from New York state politics. Although Roosevelt was reluctant to accept the nomination for vice president, which he regarded as a relatively trivial and powerless office, his great popularity among most Republican delegates led McKinley to pick him as his new running mate. Quite unexpectedly, Roosevelt would be elevated to the presidency in September 1901, when McKinley was [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinated]] in [[Buffalo, New York]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+The balloting<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hinshaw |first=Seth |title=Ohio Elects the President: Our State's Role in Presidential Elections 1804-1996 |publisher=Book Masters, Inc |year=2000 |location=Mansfield |pages=68}}</ref>\n|-\n!Presidential ballot || || Vice presidential ballot ||\n|-\n|[[William McKinley]] || 926||   [[Theodore Roosevelt]] || 925\n|-\n|| ||  || Not voting || 1 (Theodore Roosevelt)\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Democratic Party nomination ===\n{{Main|1900 Democratic National Convention}}\n[[File:The issue - 1900.

Newspapers started attacking him as naïve after he was quoted as saying the job of president would be easy, since the chief executive was merely following orders in executing the laws enacted by Congress, and that he would \"execute the laws of Congress as faithfully as I have always executed the orders of my superiors.\" Shortly thereafter, he admitted never having voted in a presidential election before, mentioning that the only man he ever would have voted for, had he voted, would have been [[Grover Cleveland]].

At the state level, local Populist parties were left at liberty to proceed as they saw fit. In the Plains states, the Populists fused with the Democrats and, in some states, replaced them entirely. In the South, the Populists fused with the Republican Party. The result, though Bryan was defeated, was that the Populists greatly enlarged their representation in Congress from 10 to 26. In several southern states, however, the legislatures were still controlled by the Democrats, and they began passing a series of laws to eliminate the franchise for black voters with the intention of undermining a significant bloc of Populist support. The move had its intended consequences; in the 1898 mid-term election, Populist representation in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] fell to 9, its lowest level since the party was founded.\n\nThe treatment of Populists by Democrats led to a division within the party. On May 17, 1899, Populist leaders met in St. Louis and issued an address calling for a \"Middle of the Road\" policy in which the party would decline future fusion efforts. The statement was primarily aimed at the party's national chairman, U.S. Senator [[Marion Butler]] of North Carolina, <!--[New York Times, May 18, 1899]-->who had been elected to the Senate through fusion with North Carolina Republicans and was already working for the renomination of William Jennings Bryan on the 1900 Populist ticket. The pro-fusion leaders of the Populists fought back in early 1900. The first state party known to have split was the Nebraska party, which divided during its state convention on March 19. <!--[New York Times, March 20, 1900]-->Both factions appointed delegates to the national convention, scheduled for Cincinnati. Ultimately, the Fusion Populists decided to hold a separate national convention when it became apparent that the Ohio Populists did not favor fusion and were working to organize a convention which would not nominate Bryan.\n\n==== \"Fusion\" Populist nomination ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|<big>'''1900 \"Fusionist\" People's Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#6EC96F; width:200px;\"| [[William Jennings Bryan|{{color|white|William Jennings Bryan}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#6EC96F; width:200px;\"| [[Adlai Stevenson I|{{color|white|Adlai Stevenson}}]]\n|-\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#ACE1AF; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#ACE1AF; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:WilliamJBryan1902.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n| [[File:Adlai Stevenson I by Saroney c1892-crop.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|-\n| [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]]<br>for [[Nebraska's 1st congressional district|Nebraska's 1st]]<br><small>(1891–1895)</small>\n| [[List of vice presidents of the United States|23rd]]<br>[[Vice President of the United States]]<br><small>(1893–1897)</small>\n|-\n| colspan=2 |[[William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign, 1900|'''Campaign''']]\n|-\n|}\n\nThe \"Fusion\" Populist National Convention assembled in a large tent just west of [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]] on May 9 and unanimously nominated Bryan for the presidency.

The Kangaroo faction was removed from the party and formed their own Socialist Labor Party. The Kangaroo faction lost a court case against De Leon for control of the party. They nominated [[Job Harriman]] for president and [[Max S. Hayes]] for vice president although they were not meant to run in the 1900 election and were instead used for a compromise with the [[Social Democratic Party of America]].<ref name=\"socialist\" />\n\nThe Social Democrats had been invited to the Kangaroos' convention, but declined although the Social Democrats supported unity between the parties. The Social Democratic National Executive Board allowed for the Kangaroo faction to send delegates to its national convention. The Kangaroos passed a resolution supporting unity and created a unity committee. Sixty-seven delegates from thirty-two states attuned the 1900 convention and voted by acclamation to give their presidential nomination to Debs. Hayes and Harriman were both nominated for the vice-presidential nomination and Harriman won it.<ref name=\"socialist\" />\n\nThe executive board announced on May 12, 1900, that they would not support unity with the Kangaroos after accusing them of being too dogmatic and impeding a unity referendum. The Kangaroo unity committee sent out sent out ballots to members of both groups and both voted in favor of unity. The Kangaroos nominated Debs and Harriman as their presidential ticket which Debs accepted on July 31. Debs and [[George D.

Committed to endorsing [[William Jennings Bryan]] for the Presidency, the primary aim of many of those attending was to promote the nomination of national chairman [[Charles A. Towne|Charles Towne]] for the Vice Presidency by the Democratic Party, an effort endorsed by Fusionist Populists who had nominated Towne to the same position two months earlier. Unfortunately for those who boomed Towne these efforts may have backfired, pushing away Democratic delegates who might have otherwise been favorable to Towne by presenting the ticket of Bryan and Towne as a fait accompli, with Southern Democratic delegates themselves preferring a vice-presidential nominee who'd appeal to voters the Democratic Party lost in the Northeast and Midwest four years prior. Hopes for a personal endorsement of Towne by Bryan were also dashed when Bryan, who personally preferred Towne of those candidates in running and was expected to make mention of this in an acceptance, decided against going to the convention or involving himself in the Vice-Presidential contest. Ultimately, Towne was a distant third, with [[Adlai Stevenson I|Adlai Stevenson]] winning the nod.<!--[NYT July 5, 1900]--><!--[NYT July 6, 1900]--><!--[NYT July 7, 1900]-->\n\nThe nomination of Stevenson, who'd previously served as [[Grover Cleveland]]'s vice president, outraged many of the Lincoln Republicans still in attendance, and in the ensuing pandemonium attempts were made to nominate Charles Towne for the Vice Presidency. Only when Charles Towne himself addressed the convention did the anger settle. Declining the efforts to nominate him, Towne pleaded with the delegates present to accept and support the Democratic ticket as it was, noting that Bryan was at the head of it and much of the Democratic Platform was aligned with that of the Lincoln Republicans. Others, such as Senator [[Fred Dubois]], Senator [[Henry M. Teller|Henry Teller]], and [[John F. Shafroth|John Shafroth]] made similar speeches calling for support for Bryan and Stevenson. It was eventually decided that the question of the vice presidential nomination would be handled by the National Committee. They would formalize and endorsement of Adlai Stevenson for the Vice Presidency the following day, in deference to Towne's wishes.<!--[NYT July 7, 1900]--><!--[NYT July 8, 1900]-->\n\n====Anti-Imperialist League nomination====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|<big>'''1900 Anti-Imperialist League ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#FFC14E; width:200px;\"| [[William Jennings Bryan|{{color|white|William Jennings Bryan}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#FFC14E; width:200px;\"| [[Adlai Stevenson I|{{color|white|Adlai Stevenson}}]]\n|-\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#FFE1A8; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#FFE1A8; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:WilliamJBryan1902.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n| [[File:Adlai Stevenson I by Saroney c1892-crop.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|-\n| [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]]<br>for [[Nebraska's 1st congressional district|Nebraska's 1st]]<br><small>(1891–1895)</small>\n| [[List of vice presidents of the United States|23rd]]<br>[[Vice President of the United States]]<br><small>(1893–1897)</small>\n|-\n| colspan=2 |[[William Jennings Bryan presidential campaign, 1900|'''Campaign''']]\n|-\n|}\n\nThe [[American Anti-Imperialist League]] had been formed in 1898 in opposition to the acquisition of the Philippine Islands, considering its annexation violating the concept of \"[[consent of the governed]]\". While not formalized as a political party, there existed a movement within the League that sought to nominate an independent ticket to run solely on the platform of anti-imperialism or, barring that, to endorse whichever Republican or Democratic presidential nominee that was themselves anti-imperialist. Upon the nominations of McKinley and Bryan however, there were immediate divisions on whether to endorse Bryan and the Democratic Platform, many sympathizing Republicans and Gold Democrats finding it anathema to their own political philosophies beyond its denouncement of imperialism; already by July some were considering supporting McKinley in November. Later that same month a call was made for a National Convention to meet in Indianapolis on August 15 with the intention of either endorsing or nominating a ticket for the general election. Discussions were held with remnants of [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic Party]] about the possibility of a fusion ticket, but this was voted down by their national committee. Then discussed names for possible presidential candidates were former Speaker [[Thomas Brackett Reed|Thomas Reed]], former Secretary of State [[Richard Olney]], former Massachusetts Governor [[George S. Boutwell|George Boutwell]], and former Senator [[John B. Henderson|John Henderson]]<!--[NYT July 10, 1900]--><!--[NYT July 24, 1900]--><!--[NYT July 25, 1900]--><!--[NYT July 26, 1900]--><!--[NYT August 15, 1900]-->\n\nFrom the beginning the headwinds were in Bryan's favor, with permanent President [[George S. Boutwell|George Boutwell]] addressing the convention and calling for the endorsement of the Democratic ticket, this followed in speeches by former General [[John Beatty (Ohio banker)|John Beatty]], [[Edgar Bancroft]], and Gamaliel Bradford. The resolution to endorse Bryan however was subject to prolonged debate, its principal opponents being representatives of the \"third-ticket\" movement led by [[Thomas Mott Osborne|Thomas Osborne]]. Osborne and those who followed him theorized that many anti-imperialists would not be willing to vote for Bryan or in favor of the Democratic Platform, and would be better served by a candidate of their own. Charles Codman, the author of the resolution, and Edwin Burritt Smith countered that all issues were secondary to the issue of imperialism, and that the most effective means by which to put an anti-imperialist in office should be used. In a voice vote, the Platform of the \"Liberty Congress\" as it was then known as adopted overwhelmingly, with all amendments to strike the endorsement of the Bryan/Stevenson ticket being voted down. Osborne and other \"third-ticketers\" would then bolt to the then nearby organizing National Party.<!--[NYT August 15, 1900]--><!--[NYT August 16, 1900]--><!--[NYT August 17, 1900]-->\n\n====National Party nomination====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|<big>'''1900 National Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#EE6666; width:200px;\"| [[Donelson Caffery|{{color|white|Donelson Caffery}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#EE6666; width:200px;\"| [[Archibald M.

The first steps towards its formation were taken after the failure of a number of anti-imperialists, among them [[Thomas Mott Osborne|Thomas Osborne]] and [[John Jay Chapman]], to convince the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic Party]] to either nominate or endorse a third party ticket. A statement was then released by the attending League delegates from New York, denouncing both the Republican and Democratic parties, advocating for the independence of the Philippines and Porto Rico [sic], supporting gold standard and a sound banking system, calling for the abolition of special privileges, and demanding a public service based on merit exclusively. They also called for a national convention to be held from August 14 to 15, which would have placed it alongside the \"national\" League Convention that was being held from August 15 to August 16.\n\nAs the delegates arrived in Indianapolis, it was hoped that the League could be convinced to nominate a third party ticket, with the National Party then offering its endorsement. It swiftly became clear however that the majority of the delegates to the Anti-Imperialist League Convention were in sympathy with Bryan and prepared to endorse him, and attempts on the part of anti-Bryan delegates to kept the platform at least non-committal on the subject of the presidential race were unsuccessful. Those League delegates that were associated with the National Party then left and proceeded to elect Thomas Osborne as Permanent Chairman, calling for a new national convention to be held on September 5. It is claimed that at the time the National Party presidential nomination was offered to [[Moorfield Storey]], but Storey declined and ultimately opted to run as an Anti-Imperialist Independent in the 11th District of Massachusetts; [[William Jackson Palmer]] was suggested as a vice-presidential nominee to run alongside him.<!--[NYT July 25, 1900]--><!--[NYT July 26, 1900]--><!--[NYT August 14, 1900]--><!--[NYT August 16, 1900]--><!--[NYT August 17, 1900]-->\n\nMeeting in [[Carnegie Hall]] (then Chamber Music Hall) on 5 September, the National Party was formalized, nominating Senator [[Donelson Caffery]] of Louisiana for the Presidency, and historian [[Archibald M. Howe|Archibald Howe]] of Massachusetts for the Vice Presidency. Though there was some concern over whether Caffery would accept the nomination if offered, Osborne claimed that he had been communicating with Caffrey and that he was both sympathetic to the National Party and willing to be their candidate for the Presidency. The party platform was virtually identical to the one offered by the League committee back in July, though the definition of \"special privileges was defined as \"subsidies, bounties, undeserved pensions, or trust-busting tariffs.\" A strategy was also adopted where, in those States where it was impractical to nominate a full slate of electors, a single elector would be nominated instead, allowing for voters to vote the Nationalist ticket as well as one other of their choice; it was hoped that this might avail concerns that the Nationalists would take votes away from either Bryan or McKinley, depending on the voters' sympathies.<!--[NYT September 6, 1900]-->\n\nUnfortunately for the Nationalist Party Senator Cafferty declined the nomination some weeks later, resulting in a scramble where [[Arthur Briggs Farquhar]], owner of the [[Pennsylvania Agricultural Works]], was considered as a possible replacement. A day later, on September 21, the Massachusetts branch of the Party voted to disband. It was then hoped that unpledged electors could be nominated, but papers were only ever taken out for one, [[Edward Waldo Emerson]] of Massachusetts.<!--[NYT September 21, 1900]--><!--[NYT September 22, 1900]--><!--[NYT September 27, 1900]-->\n\n====Other nominations====\n\nThe [[Union Reform Party of Ohio|Union Reform Party]] nominated [[Seth H. Ellis]] of Ohio for president and Samuel T. Nicholson for vice president.\n\nThe [[United Christian Party (United States)|United Christian Party]] nominated Jonah F. R. Leonard for president, and David H. Martin for vice president. Initially, the party had nominated [[Silas C. Swallow]] for president and [[John G. Woolley]] for vice president, but both men refused, choosing instead to contest the Prohibition Party nomination ''(of which Woolley would emerge the victor)''.\n\n==General election==\n\n===Campaign===\n[[File:McKinley Prosperity.jpg|thumb|right|150px|McKinley campaigns on gold coin (gold standard) with support from soldiers, businessmen, farmers and professionals, claiming to restore prosperity at home and victory abroad]]\nThe economy was booming in 1900, so the Republican slogan of \"Four More Years of the Full Dinner Pail,\" combined with victory in the brief [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, had a powerful electoral appeal. Teddy Roosevelt had become a national hero fighting in Cuba during the war, and as such he was a popular spokesman for the Republican ticket.  Roosevelt proved highly energetic, and an equal match for William Jennings Bryan's famous barnstorming style of campaigning. Roosevelt's theme was that McKinley had brought America peace and prosperity and deserved re-election. In a whirlwind campaign, Roosevelt made 480 stops in 23 states.<ref>John M. Hilpert, ''American Cyclone: Theodore Roosevelt and His 1900 Whistle-Stop Campaign'' (U Press of Mississippi, 2015).</ref> In his speeches, he repeatedly argued that the war had been just and had liberated the Cubans and Filipinos from Spanish tyranny:<ref>[Brands 1997: 400]</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|\nFour years ago the nation was uneasy because at our very doors an American island was writhing in hideous agony under a worse than medieval despotism. We had our Armenia at our threshold. The situation in Cuba had become such that we could no longer stand quiet and retain one shred of self-respect.... We drew the sword and waged the most righteous and brilliantly successful foreign war that this generation has seen.\n}}\n\nBryan's campaign was built around a reprise of his major issue from the 1896 campaign: [[Free Silver]]. It was not as successful in 1900, because prosperity had replaced severe depression and McKinley claimed credit. Advocates of enlarging the money supply to raise prices had to admit that a great deal of new gold was flowing into the world economy, and deflation (i.e. falling prices) was no longer a threat. Bryan's second major campaign theme attacked McKinley's [[imperialism]]; Bryan had supported the war, but opposed the annexation of the Philippines. He said McKinley had simply replaced a cruel Spanish tyranny with a cruel American one. Bryan was especially harsh in his criticisms of the American military effort to suppress a bloody rebellion by Filipino guerillas. This theme won over some previous opponents, especially \"hard money\" Germans, former [[National Democratic Party (United States)|Gold Democrats]], and anti-imperialists such as [[Andrew Carnegie]].\n\nBoth candidates repeated their 1896 campaign techniques, with McKinley campaigning again from the front porch of his home in [[Canton, Ohio]]. At the peak of the campaign, he greeted sixteen delegations and 30,000 cheering supporters in one day. Meanwhile, Bryan took to the rails again, traveling 18,000 miles to hundreds of rallies across the Midwest and East. This time, he was matched by Theodore Roosevelt, who campaigned just as energetically in 24 states, covering 21,000 miles by train.\n\n[[File:Germans1900.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The [[German-American]] vote in 1900 was in doubt since they opposed both Bryan's \"repudiation\" policy and overseas \"expansion\" under McKinley.]]\nThe triumph of the American army and navy in the war against Spain was a decisive factor in building Republican support. Democrats tried to argue that the war was not over because of the insurgency in the Philippines; this became their major issue. A perception that the [[Philippine–American War]] was coming to an end would be an electoral asset for the Republicans, and the McKinley administration stated that there were reductions of troops there. Republicans pledged that the fighting in the Philippines would die down of its own accord within sixty days of McKinley's re-election.<ref>[Miller 1982: 143]; Detroit Evening News, September 7, 1900; San Francisco Call, September 8, 21, 1900; Boston Evening Transcript, September 20, 1900</ref>\nHowever, as one lieutenant explained in a letter to his wife, \"It looks good on paper, but there really has been no reduction of the force here. These battalions [being sent home] are made up on men...about to be discharged.\"<ref>[Miller 1982: 148]; Lt. Samuel Powell Lyon to his wife, April 12, 1900, Carlisle Collection</ref>\n\nIn addition, Secretary of War [[Elihu Root]] had a report from MacArthur of September 1900 that he did not release until after the election.<ref>[Miller 1982: 143, 148]</ref> General [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]], had been in command of the Philippines for four months, warning Washington that the war was not lessening and that the end was not even in sight. MacArthur believed that the guerrilla stage of the war was just beginning and that Filipinos were refining their techniques through experience. Furthermore, Philippine leader [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]'s strategy had popular support. MacArthur wrote:\n\n{{blockquote|The success of this unique system of war depends upon almost complete unity of action of the entire native population. That such unity is a fact is too obvious to admit of discussion; how it is brought about and maintained is not so plain. Intimidation has undoubtedly accomplished much to this end, but fear as the only motive is hardly sufficient to account for the united and apparently spontaneous action of several millions of people. One traitor in each town would eventually destroy such a complex organization. It is more probable that the adhesive principle comes from ethological homogeneity, which induces men to respond for a time to the appeals of consanguineous leadership even when such action is opposed to their interests and convictions of expediency.<ref>[Miller 1982: 150–151]; [[Literary Digest]] 21 (1900): 605–606</ref>}}\n\nNonetheless, the majority of soldiers in the Philippines did not support Bryan. Any mention of the election of 1900 in the soldiers' letters and diaries indicated overwhelming support for the Republican ticket of McKinley and Roosevelt. According to Sergeant Beverly Daley, even the \"howling Democrats\" favored McKinley. Private Hambleton wrote, \"Of course, there are some boys who think Bryan is the whole cheese, but they don't say too much.\"<ref>[Miller 1982: 187]; Letters of Sergeant Beverly Daley, November 16, 1900, Private Hambleton, March 4, 1900.</ref>\n\nDespite Bryan's energetic efforts, the renewed prosperity under McKinley, combined with the public's approval of the [[Spanish–American War]], allowed McKinley to gain a comfortable victory.\n\n===Results===\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1900Colorbrewer.gif|right|thumb|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for the winning candidate.

He carried 28 states with a combined 292 electoral votes (65.32%). He slightly increased his national percentage (51.60%) with 120,000 more votes than in 1896. This change is reflected in the gains made in number of counties carried; McKinley had 222 more counties than he had carried in 1896, thus gaining a slight majority of the total number of counties making returns in 1900.\n\nOf the 2,729 counties making returns, McKinley won in 1,385 (50.75%) while Bryan carried 1,340 (49.10%). Two counties (0.07%) were split evenly between McKinley and Bryan, while two counties (0.07%) in Texas recorded more votes cast for \"Other(s)\" than either of the two-party candidates. McKinley had a majority in 1,288 counties while Bryan had a majority in 1,253 counties.\n\nFurther examination reveals that changes in counties were even more impressive. Of the 2,729 counties making returns, 2,286 were identical in these two elections; 113 changed from Republican to Democratic; and 328 changed from Democratic to Republican.\n\nA notable feature was the Bryan gains made in the [[New England]] and [[Northeastern United States|(Northeastern)]] [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] sections, with also a slight gain in the [[East North Central States|East North Central]] section.<ref name=pg9>The Presidential Vote, 1896–1932, Edgar E.

Robinson, pg. 37</ref> In all other sections, Bryan's vote was less than in 1896, and in the nation his total vote was 23,000 less than in 1896. The percentage of total was 45.52, a slight loss. Kentucky, which he carried this time, showed an increase of 17,005. In 16 states, the Democratic vote increased, but in 29 states it was less than in 1896. Bryan carried only 17 states. This was the only one of his three runs in which he failed to carry his home state of Nebraska.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historical U.S. Presidential Elections 1789-2020 - 270toWin |url=https://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/ |access-date=2022-05-27 |website=270toWin.com}}</ref>\n\nThis was the last election in which the Republicans won the majority of electoral votes in Maryland until 1920. It is also the last election in which a Republican won the presidency without winning Idaho and Montana. In addition, this would also be the last election in 100 years when the Republican candidate would win without earning a minimum of 300 electoral votes. That did not occur again until [[George W.

Incumbent [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] defeated the conservative [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, [[Alton B. Parker]]. Roosevelt's victory made him the first president who ascended to the presidency upon the death of his predecessor to win a full term in his own right. This was also the second presidential election in which both major party candidates were registered in the same home state; the others have been in [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]], [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]], [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. \n\nRoosevelt [[First inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt|took]] office in September 1901 following the [[assassination of William McKinley|assassination]] of his predecessor, [[William McKinley]]. After the February 1904 death of McKinley's ally, Senator [[Mark Hanna]], Roosevelt faced little opposition at the [[1904 Republican National Convention]]. The conservative [[Bourbon Democrat]] allies of former President [[Grover Cleveland]] temporarily regained control of the Democratic Party from the followers of [[William Jennings Bryan]], and the [[1904 Democratic National Convention]] nominated [[Alton B. Parker]], [[Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals]]. Parker triumphed on the first ballot of the convention, defeating newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]].\n\nAs there was little difference between the candidates' positions, the race was largely based on their personalities; the Democrats argued the Roosevelt presidency was \"arbitrary\" and \"erratic.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/roosevelt/essays/biography/3 |title=Theodore Roosevelt: Campaigns and Elections—Miller Center |website=Millercenter.org |access-date=2016-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006095335/http://millercenter.org/president/roosevelt/essays/biography/3 |archive-date=October 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Republicans emphasized Roosevelt's success in foreign affairs and his record of firmness against [[monopoly|monopolies]]. Roosevelt easily defeated Parker, sweeping every US region except the [[Solid South|South]], while Parker lost multiple states won by Bryan in 1900, as well as his home state of New York. Roosevelt's [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|popular vote margin]] of 18.8% was the largest since [[James Monroe]]'s victory in the [[1820 United States presidential election|1820 presidential election]], and would be the biggest popular vote victory in the century between 1820 and [[Warren G. Harding|Warren Harding's]] [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]] landslide. With Roosevelt's landslide, he became the first presidential candidate to receive over 300 electoral votes in a presidential election. This was the first time that [[Missouri]] supported the Republican candidate since [[1868 United States presidential election|1868]].\n\n==Nominations==\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Republican Disc.svg|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''1904 Republican Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[Theodore Roosevelt|{{color|white|Theodore Roosevelt}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[Charles W.

A dump-Roosevelt movement had centered on the candidacy of conservative Senator [[Mark Hanna]] from Ohio, but Hanna's death in February 1904 had removed this obstacle. Roosevelt's nomination speech was delivered by former governor [[Frank S. Black]] of New York and seconded by Senator [[Albert J. Beveridge]] from Indiana. Roosevelt was nominated unanimously on the first ballot with 994 votes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |last1=Bain |first1=Richard C. |title=Convention Decisions and Voting Records |last2=Parris |first2=Judith H. |publisher=[[The Brookings Institution]] |year=1973 |isbn=0-8157-0768-1 |edition=2nd |series=Studies in Presidential Selection |location=Washington, D.C. |pages= |chapter=}}</ref>{{Rp|pages=|page=166}}\n\nSince conservatives in the Republican Party denounced Theodore Roosevelt as a radical, they were allowed to choose the vice-presidential candidate.

Roosevelt was far from pleased with the idea of Fairbanks for vice-president. He would have preferred Representative [[Robert R.

Since the two Democratic nominees from the past did not seek the presidential nomination, [[Alton B. Parker]], a [[Bourbon Democrat]] from New York, emerged as the frontrunner.\n\nParker was the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals and was respected by both Democrats and Republicans in his state. On several occasions, the Republicans paid Parker the honor of running no one against him when he ran for various political positions. Parker refused to work actively for the nomination, but did nothing to restrain his conservative supporters, among them the sachems of [[Tammany Hall]]. Former President Grover Cleveland endorsed Parker.\n\nThe delegates from Florida were selected through a primary which was the first time a primary was utilized to select the delegates for a presidential convention.<ref>{{cite book |date=1979 |title=National Party Conventions, 1831-1976 |publisher=[[Congressional Quarterly]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Democratic Convention that met in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], on July 6–9, 1904, has been called \"one of the most exciting and sensational in the history of the Democratic Party.\" The struggle inside the Democratic Party over the nomination was to prove as contentious as the election itself. Though Parker, out of active politics for twenty years, had neither enemies nor errors to make him unavailable, a bitter battle was waged against Parker by the more liberal wing of the party in the months before the convention.\n\nDespite the fact that Parker had supported Bryan in [[1896 United States presidential election|1896]] and [[1900 United States presidential election|1900]], Bryan hated him for being a [[National Democratic Party (United States)|Gold Democrat]]. Bryan wanted the weakest man nominated, one who could not take the control of the party away from him. He denounced Judge Parker as a tool of [[Wall Street]] before he was nominated and declared that no self-respecting Democrat could vote for him.\n\nInheriting Bryan's support was publisher, now congressman, [[William Randolph Hearst]] of New York. Hearst owned eight newspapers, all of them friendly to labor, vigorous in their trust-busting activities, fighting the cause of \"the people who worked for a living.\" Because of this liberalism, Hearst had the Illinois delegation pledged to him and the promise of several other states. Although Hearst's newspaper was the only major publication in the East to support William Jennings Bryan and [[Bimetallism]] in 1896, he found that his support for Bryan was not reciprocated. Instead, Bryan seconded the nomination of [[Francis Cockrell]].\n\n[[Image:HenryGDavis.png|thumb|160px|left|At 80, Davis is the oldest major party candidate ever nominated for national office.]]\nThe prospect of having Hearst for a candidate frightened conservative Democrats so much that they renewed their efforts to get Parker nominated on the first ballot. Parker received 658 votes on the first roll call, 9 short of the necessary two-thirds. Before the result could be announced, 21 more votes were transferred to Parker. As a result, Parker handily won the nomination on the first ballot with 679 votes to 181 for Hearst and the rest scattered.\n\nAfter Parker's nomination, Bryan charged that it had been dictated by the trusts and secured by \"crooked and indefensible methods.\" Bryan also said that labor had been betrayed in the convention and could look for nothing from the Democratic Party. Indeed, Parker was one of the judges on the New York Court of Appeals who declared the eight-hour law unconstitutional.<ref name=\"www2.cddc\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/archive/debs/works/1904/sp_wkingclss.htm |title=E.

To make his position clear, Parker, after his nomination, informed the convention by letter that he supported the gold standard. The letter read, \"I regard the gold standard as firmly and irrevocably established and shall act accordingly if the action of the convention today shall be ratified by the people. As the platform is silent on the subject, my view should be made known to the convention, and if it is proved to be unsatisfactory to the majority, I request you to decline the nomination for me at once, so that another may be nominated before adjournment.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kdl.kyvl.org/cgi/t/text/text-idx?sid=1ebd4033d53717e3eea48cbdbf578458;idno=b92-77-27211776;c=kyetexts;cc=kyetexts;view=toc|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130113014107/http://kdl.kyvl.org/cgi/t/text/text-idx?sid=1ebd4033d53717e3eea48cbdbf578458;idno=b92-77-27211776;c=kyetexts;cc=kyetexts;view=toc|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-13|title=Official report of the proceedings of the Democratic national convention|page=277|website=Kdl.kyvl.org|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nIt was the first time a candidate had made such a move.

The campaign season was pervaded by goodwill, and it went a long way toward mending the damage done by the previous class-war elections. This was due to the fact that Parker and Roosevelt, with the exception of charisma, were so similar in political outlook.\n\nSo close were the two candidates that few differences could be detected. Both men were for the gold standard; though the Democrats were more outspokenly against imperialism, both believed in fair treatment for the Filipinos and eventual liberation; and both believed that labor unions had the same rights as individuals before the courts. The radicals in the Democratic Party denounced Parker as a conservative; the conservatives in the Republican Party denounced Theodore Roosevelt as a radical.\n\nDuring the campaign, there were a couple of instances in which Roosevelt was seen as vulnerable. In the first place, [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s ''New York World'' carried a full-page story about alleged corruption in the Bureau of Corporations. President Roosevelt admitted certain payments had been made, but denied any \"blackmail.\" Secondly, in appointing [[George B. Cortelyou]] as his campaign manager, Roosevelt had purposely used his former Secretary of Commerce and Labor. This was of importance because Cortelyou, knowing the secrets of the corporations, could extract large contributions from them. The charge created quite a stir and in later years was proven to be sound. In 1907, it was disclosed that the insurance companies had contributed rather too heavily to the Roosevelt campaign. Only a week before the election, Roosevelt himself called [[E. H. Harriman]], the railroad king, to [[Washington, D.C.]], for the purpose of raising funds to carry [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=\"TheyAlso\" />\n\nInsider money, however, was spent on both candidates. Parker received financial support from the [[J. P. Morgan|Morgan]] banking interests, just as [[Bourbon Democrat]] [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland]] had before him. [[Thomas W. Lawson (businessman)|Thomas W. Lawson]], the Boston millionaire, charged that [[New York State Senate|New York state Senator]] [[Patrick H. McCarren|Patrick Henry McCarren]], a prominent Parker backer, was on the payroll of [[Standard Oil]] at the rate of twenty thousand dollars a year. Lawson offered Senator McCarren $100,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.1|1904|fmt=c|r=1}} million today) if he would disprove the charge.<ref name=\"www2.cddc\" /> According to one account, \"No denial of the charge was ever made by the Senator.\" One paper even referred to McCarren as \"the Standard Oil serpent of Brooklyn politics.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboweryboys.blogspot.com/2009/02/patrick-mccarren-how-politican-became.html |title=The Bowery Boys: New York City History |website=Theboweryboys.blogspot.com |access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\n===Results===\n[[Image:McCutcheonMysteriousStrange.jpg|200px|thumb|left|\"The Mysterious Stranger\" – A political cartoon showing [[Missouri]] having left the [[Solid South]] by voting Republican.]]\nTheodore Roosevelt won a landslide victory, taking every Northern and Western state. He was the first Republican to carry the state of Missouri since [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in [[1868 United States presidential election|1868]]. In voting Republican, Missouri repositioned itself from being associated with the [[Solid South]] to being seen as a [[Missouri bellwether|bellwether]] ''swing state'' throughout the 20th century. The vote in [[Maryland]] was extremely close. For the first time in that state's history, secret paper ballots, supplied at public expense, and without political symbols of any kind, were issued to each voter. Candidates for Electors were listed under the presidential and vice presidential candidates for each party; there were four parties recognized in the election: Democratic, Republican, Prohibition, and Socialist. Voters were free to mark their ballots for up to eight candidates of any party. While Roosevelt's victory nationally was quickly determined, the election in Maryland remained in doubt for several weeks. On November 30, Roosevelt was declared the statewide victor by just 51 votes.  However, as voters had voted for individual [[Electoral College (United States)|presidential electors]], only one Republican elector, [[Charles Bonaparte (Attorney General)|Charles Bonaparte]], survived the tally.  The other seven top vote recipients were Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/speccol/sc2200/sc2221/000031/000000/html/00000001.html |title=Too Close to Call: Presidential Electors and Elections in Maryland featuring the Presidential Election of 1904 |website=Msa.maryland.gov |access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1904Colorbrewer.gif|right|thumb|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for the winning candidate.

Watson|Thomas Watson]], the Populist candidate, received 117,183 votes and won nine counties (0.33%) in his home state of Georgia. He had a majority in five of the counties, and his vote total was double the Populist's showing in 1900 but less than one eighth of the party's total in [[1892 United States presidential election|1892]].\n\nParker carried 1,133 counties (41.14%) and won a majority in 1,057. The distribution of the vote by counties reveals him to have been a weaker candidate than [[William Jennings Bryan]], the party's nominee [[1900 United States presidential election#Results|four years earlier]], in every section of the nation, except for the deep South, where Democratic dominance remained strong, due in large part to pervasive [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchisement]] of blacks.<ref name=\"Presidential Elections\">Presidential Elections, 1789–2008: County, State, and National Mapping of Election Data, Donald R.

[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee [[William Howard Taft]] defeated three-time [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[William Jennings Bryan]].\n\n[[File:Unsuccessful 1912 2.jpg|thumb|189x189px|The [[incumbent]] in 1908, Theodore Roosevelt. His second term expired at noon on March 4, 1909.]]\n\n[[Incumbent]] President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] honored his promise not to seek a third term (for him, a second full term), and persuaded his close friend, Taft, to become his successor. With Roosevelt's support, Taft won the presidential nomination at the [[1908 Republican National Convention]] on the first ballot. The Democratic Party nominated Bryan, who had been defeated twice previously, in [[1896 United States presidential election|1896]] and [[1900 United States presidential election|1900]], by Republican [[William McKinley]]. \n\nBryan, part of the more [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] or progressive wing of the Democratic Party, ran a vigorous campaign against the nation's business elite. But even so, he suffered the worst loss of his three presidential campaigns in his percentage of both the popular vote and electoral vote. Taft won 51.6% of the popular vote and carried most states outside of the [[Solid South]]. Taft's triumph gave Republicans their fourth consecutive presidential election victory. The Republican Party lost the presidency [[1912 United States presidential election|four years later]] to the Democrats, due to a party split between Taft and Roosevelt. Two [[third party (United States)|third-party]] candidates, [[Eugene V. Debs]] of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] and [[Eugene W.

Foraker#Defeat for re-election|'''Campaign''']]\n|\n|}\n\nThe Republican nomination contest marked the introduction of the [[United States presidential primary|presidential preference primary]]. The idea of the primary to nominate candidates was sponsored by anti-machine politicians such as [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Albert B. Cummins]]. The first state to hold a presidential primary to select delegates to a national convention was Florida in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]], when Democratic Party voters held a primary among uninstructed candidates for delegate. Early in 1908, the only two Republican contenders running nationwide campaigns for the presidential nomination were [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[William Howard Taft]] and [[List of Governors of Ohio|Governor]] [[Joseph B. Foraker]], both of Ohio. In the nomination contest, four states held primaries to select national [[Republican National Convention|convention]] [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s. In Ohio, the state Republican Party held a primary on February 11. Candidates pledged to Taft were printed on the ballot in a Taft column, and candidates pledged to Foraker were printed in a column under his name. Taft won a resounding victory in Ohio. The three states holding primaries to select delegates without the preference component were split: California chose a slate of delegates that supported Taft; Wisconsin elected a slate that supported Wisconsin Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]], and Pennsylvania elected a slate that supported its Senator [[Philander C. Knox]].\n\nThe 1908 Republican Convention was held in [[Chicago]] between June 16 and 19. [[William Howard Taft]] was nominated with 702 votes to 68 for Knox, 67 for Hughes, 58 for Cannon, 40 for Fairbanks, 25 for La Follette, 16 for Foraker, 3 for President Roosevelt, and one abstention.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bain|first1=Richard C.|last2=Parris|first2=Judith H.|title=Convention Decisions and Voting Records|page=174|isbn=0-8157-0768-1}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''Presidential Ballot'''\n|-\n| '''Candidate'''\n| '''1st'''\n| '''Unanimous'''\n|-\n![[William Howard Taft]] !!702!!980\n|-\n![[Philander C.

Bryan's most formidable challenger for the nomination was [[Minnesota Governor]] [[John Albert Johnson]]. Johnson's [[rags-to-riches story]], honesty, reformist credentials, and ability to win in a heavily Republican state made him popular within the Democratic Party. In March, the Minnesota Democratic State Convention endorsed Johnson for president. By the end of June, however, Bryan had amassed more than the requisite two-thirds of the delegates needed for nomination.\n\nThe [[1908 Democratic National Convention]] was held in [[Denver]] between July 7 and 10. Johnson, aware of the fact that Bryan's nomination was a foregone conclusion, released his delegates, thereby allowing Bryan to win the nomination on the first ballot.<ref name=\"harpweek1908\">{{cite web|url=http://elections.harpweek.com/1908/Overview-1908-2.htm |title=HarpWeek &#124; Elections &#124; The Democratic Nomination |publisher=Elections.harpweek.com |access-date=2017-09-23}}</ref>\n\nBryan left the choice of vice-president to the delegates. [[John W. Kern]] from [[Indiana]] was unanimously declared the candidate for vice-president without a formal ballot after the names of [[Charles A. Towne]], [[Archibald McNeil]], and [[Clark Howell]] were withdrawn from consideration. Kern was a former [[Indiana Senate|state senator]] (1893-1897) and two-time [[Indiana Governor|gubernatorial]] candidate ([[Indiana gubernatorial election, 1900|1900]] and [[Indiana gubernatorial election, 1904|1904]]).\n\nIn response to nomination of Bryan and Kern, ''[[The New York Times]]'' disparagingly pointed out that the Democratic national ticket was consistent because \"a man twice defeated for the Presidency was at the head of it, and a man twice defeated for governor of his state was at the tail of it.\"<ref name=\"harpweek1908\"/>\n\n=== Third parties and independents ===\n==== People's Party nomination ====\n===== Nominees =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|<big>'''1908 People's Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#ACE1AF; width:200px;\"| [[Thomas E.

Its total was twice the party's total in the previous presidential election, and in ten states, it received over 1% of the vote. It also offered 47 candidates for the House of Representatives, though the only ones elected were cross-endorsed by one of the major parties. The party remained in fusion with either the Democrats or the Republicans in many states.\n \nThe following three years were a trying time for the party. When Democrats began to call for the nomination of Bryan in 1908, western Populist leader [[Thomas Tibbles]] announced that the People's Party would probably not support him since he had gone into the hands of the Eastern business interests.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/06/11/101781931.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/06/11/101781931.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Newspaper clipping|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2020-07-04}}</ref> Two months later, Nebraska Democrats decided in their state convention to end fusion with the Populists, but they changed their mind after an all-night conference.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/08/17/101794083.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/08/17/101794083.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Newspaper clipping|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2020-07-04}}</ref> In the midterm elections the party only offered 10 candidates for House, and the Kansas People's Party officially disbanded in December when that state party's leader announced that he was joining the Republicans.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/12/08/101852309.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/12/08/101852309.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Newspaper clipping|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2020-07-04}}</ref>\n\nBy late 1907, many Populists were hoping that Thomas Watson would agree to run for president again.

[[Samuel Gompers]], the president of the [[American Federation of Labor]] and who had endorsed Bryan, criticized Debs accusing him of receiving secret funding for his train from the Republicans.

Originally borne from the [[Municipal Ownership League]], a vehicle for Hearst's ultimately unsuccessful bid for the mayoralty of New York in 1905, it was Hearst's intention to fuse it with the remnants of the Populist Party led by [[Thomas E. Watson|Thomas Watson]], a former Representative from Georgia who had been its presidential nominee in 1904. However, these intentions were dashed when every candidate that the Independence Party put forth in elections held in New York was elected except Hearst himself, despite an endorsement by the Democratic Party. Devastated, Hearst declared his intention never again to be a candidate.\n\nWhile Hearst would no longer be the nominee, he fully intended to exercise influence at Independence Party's convention; the platform itself was in large part a statement of his own views. With its candidates nominated, the party's purpose was changed from being a path for Hearst's presidential ambitions to being an instrument of his wrath. Through the influence of his papers and generous financial donations, Hearst hoped that the Independence ticket would draw away votes from William Jennings Bryan and lead to his defeat against Taft, a personal vendetta for Bryan failing to support his own bid for the Presidency in 1904.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" | '''Presidential Ballot'''\n|-\n!!!1st!!2nd!!3rd\n|-\n![[Thomas L.

However, Taft undercut Bryan's liberal support by accepting some of his reformist ideas, and Roosevelt's progressive policies blurred the distinctions between the parties. Republicans also used the slogan \"Vote for Taft now, you can vote for Bryan anytime,\" a sarcastic reference to Bryan's two failed previous presidential campaigns.\n\nThe Socialist candidate, Eugene Debs, embarked on an ambitious [[whistle-stop tour]] aboard a train nicknamed the ''Red Special'', giving speeches regarding the Socialist cause across the country. The exertion of the tour exhausted Debs, and at certain points his brother Theodore - who bore a great resemblance to Eugene - substituted for him to allow the candidate to rest.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=H.

As a result, Bryan ended up with the worst of his three defeats in the national popular vote. He lost almost all the northern states to Taft and the popular vote by 8 percentage points.\n\nThis would be Bryan's last campaign for the presidency, although he would remain a popular figure within the Democratic Party and in 1912 would play a key role in securing the presidential nomination for [[Woodrow Wilson]]. [[Charles W. Bryan]], William's brother, would become the (losing) Democratic nominee for Vice President [[1924 United States presidential election|in 1924]]. Bryan's 162 electoral votes from this election, combined with his 155 and 176 electoral votes from 1900 and 1896 respectively, make him the person with the most electoral votes never to be president.\n\n=== Results ===\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1908Colorbrewer.gif|right|thumb|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for the winning candidate.

Taft.]]\nForty-six states participated, as [[Oklahoma]] had joined the Union less than a year before. Bryan won forty-eight counties in the new state of Oklahoma. The most important increase in number of counties carried by Bryan was in the [[West South Central States|West South Central]] section, in part due to the vote of newly admitted Oklahoma.<ref name=\"autogenerated13\">The Presidential Vote, 1896–1932, Edgar E. Robinson, pg. 13</ref>\n\nOf the 2,858 counties making returns, Taft won in 1,494 (52.27%) while Bryan carried 1,355 (47.41%). Nine (0.31%) counties recorded more votes cast for \"Other(s)\" than either of the two-party candidates, whilst twenty-eight counties (0.97%) recorded zero votes due to being inhabited either by Native Americans who would not [[Indian Citizenship Act|gain full citizenship]] for sixteen years, or by [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised southern African-Americans]]. Taft had a majority in 1,325 counties while Bryan had a majority in 1,204 counties.\n\nBy carrying 1,355 counties, Bryan won more counties than he had in [[1900 United States presidential election|1900]] (1,340), but he did not reach or surpass the number of counties he had won in [[1896 United States presidential election|1896]] (1,559). While Bryan won more counties than McKinley in 1896, Bryan failed to carry more counties than the Republican candidate in 1900 or 1904. Compared with his strength in previous elections, however, Bryan carried 69 counties in 1908 which had not been Democratic in either 1896 or 1900.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\">The Presidential Vote, 1896–1932, Edgar E. Robinson, pg. 14</ref>\n\nBryan increased the area carried by Democrats in every part of the country except [[New England]] and the [[Southern United States|South]]. He doubled the number of Democratic counties in Wisconsin and won more counties in Indiana than were carried by plurality vote by the Democrats in any election in the [[Fourth Party System]] except [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]]. He made decided gains in Missouri and in his home state of Nebraska,<ref name=\"autogenerated13\" /> besides achieving notable victories in Colorado and Nevada. However, in four Western states (Washington, Oregon, Wyoming, and North Dakota), there was not one Democratic county. This was true likewise of Michigan, Delaware, and each of the New England states.\n\nThe total vote increased greatly, by more than a million vis-à-vis 1904. Each party shared in the increase, but whereas Taft had nearly fifty thousand more than Theodore Roosevelt, Bryan had nearly 1,500,000 more votes than [[Alton B. Parker|Alton Parker]] had garnered, and more than in either of his previous campaigns.\n\nIt was noticeable that the \"other\" vote was only about seven thousand less than four years earlier. The \"other\" vote was a plurality in nine counties in the states of Georgia and Texas.\n\nThe size of the vote cast for the defeated Bryan in 1908 is clear evidence of perhaps the most striking feature of the American presidential vote. In this third attempt at the presidency, and in an election following one in which the nominee of his party polled only five million votes, Bryan had heavy support in every section of the country, and in every state. Moreover, nearly two-thirds of the vote cast for Bryan was from the fifteen states of the [[Northeastern United States|(Northeastern)]] [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]], [[East North Central States|East North Central]], and [[West North Central States|West North Central]] sections, in which the Democratic candidate carried only one state (Nebraska).\n\nDespite all conclusions as to predominant sentiment in the different sections and its economic, social, and political causes, there was a national vote cast for Bryan, and it was urban as well as rural; it was eastern, western, southern, and northern. Everywhere the Democratic Party was ''the'' minority party, and it was not hopeless, nor was it helpless. It was the agency for the expression of the opposition of almost six and a half million voters.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\" />\nAccording to Historian [[George E. Mowry]]:\n: What was especially significant in the election was the continued growth in the strength of the Democratic party and the success of the so-called progressive Republican candidates in the Midwest. The Republicans had not only lost seats in the House of Representatives but they had also lost governors in Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota, and North Dakota, all of which voted for Taft. In Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, and even in Kansas self-announced progressive Republicans, who had previously defeated conservatives in the primaries, were more successful in beating their Democratic rivals. The election, ''The New York Times'' reported, had been punctuated with \"independent voting.\" A closer analysis of the returns indicated that the voter in the Midwest had expressed his independence mostly from standpat Republicanism symbolized by the control of Speaker Cannon in the House and Aldrich in the Senate.<ref>George E. Mowry, ''The Era of Theodore Roosevelt, 1900-1912'' (1958)  p 231 [https://archive.org/details/eraoftheodoreroo007107mbp online]; citing ''The New York Times,'' November 7, 1908.</ref>\n\nAs of 2022, this is the last of only two elections when Kansas and Nebraska have not voted for the same candidate.{{efn|The other was in 1892 when Kansas voted for Populist [[James B. Weaver]] and Nebraska for Republican [[Benjamin Harrison]]}} The election of 1908 was the last election in which a Republican won the presidency without winning Nebraska, and the last in which Nebraska voted differently to Kansas and North Dakota. As of 2020, Bryan was the fifth of seven presidential nominees to win a significant number of electoral votes in at least three elections, the others being Thomas Jefferson, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, Grover Cleveland, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Richard Nixon. Of these, Jackson, Cleveland, and Roosevelt also won the popular vote in at least three elections. Clay and Bryan are the only two candidates to lose the presidency three times.  \n\n[[File: United States Electoral College 1908.svg]]\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box| pv_footnote=| ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[William Howard Taft]]| party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]| state=[[Ohio]]| pv=7,678,335| pv_pct=51.57%| ev=321| vp_name=[[James S.

In the first election held after the end of the First World War and the first election after the ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] (which gave equal votes to men and women), [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Warren G. Harding]] of Ohio defeated [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Governor [[James M. Cox]] of Ohio. Both major-party vice-presidential nominees would later succeed to the presidency: [[Calvin Coolidge]] (Republican) upon Harding's death in 1923 and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (Democratic) after defeating Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1932. This was one of only six presidential elections where both major candidates had the same home state.\n\nIncumbent Democratic President [[Woodrow Wilson]] privately hoped for a third term, despite his severe physical and mental disabilities. He had very little support. Former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] had been the front-runner for the Republican nomination, but he died in 1919 without leaving an obvious heir to his [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] legacy. The major parties turned to little-known [[dark horse]] candidates from the state of Ohio, a [[swing state]] with a large number of electoral votes. Cox won the [[1920 Democratic National Convention]] on the 44th ballot, defeating [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] (Wilson's son-in-law), [[A. Mitchell Palmer]], and several other candidates. Harding emerged as a compromise candidate between the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and progressive wings of the party, and he clinched his nomination on the tenth ballot of the [[1920 Republican National Convention]].\n\nThe election was dominated by the American social and political environment in the [[aftermath of World War I]], which was marked by a hostile response to certain aspects of Wilson's foreign policy and a massive reaction against the reformist zeal of the [[Progressive Era]]. The wartime economic boom had collapsed and the country was deep in a [[Depression of 1920|recession]]. Wilson's advocacy for America's entry into the [[League of Nations]] in the face of a return to [[non-interventionist]] opinion challenged his effectiveness as president, and overseas there were wars and revolutions. At home, the year 1919 was marked by major strikes in the meatpacking and steel industries and large-scale race riots in [[Chicago]] and other cities. [[Anarchism in the United States|Anarchist]] attacks on [[Wall Street]] produced [[First Red Scare|fears of radicals and terrorists]]. The Irish Catholic and German communities were outraged at Wilson's perceived favoritism of their traditional enemy Great Britain, and his political position was critically weakened after he suffered a [[stroke]] in 1919 that left him severely disabled.\n\nHarding all but ignored Cox in the race and essentially campaigned against Wilson by calling for a \"[[return to normalcy]]\". Harding won a [[List of landslide victories#United States|landslide victory]], sweeping every state outside of the [[Southern United States|South]] and becoming the first Republican since the end of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] to win a former state of the [[Confederated States of America|Confederacy]], [[Tennessee]]. Harding's victory margin of 26.2% in the popular vote remains the largest [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|popular-vote percentage margin]] for a Republican and the largest ever since widespread popular elections began in the 1820s, although subsequent candidates (in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] and [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]]) have exceeded his share of the popular vote.<ref>[https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/compare.php?type=national&year=2020&f=0&off=0&elect=0 Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Elections (compare national data by year)]</ref> Cox won just 34.1% of the popular vote, and [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] [[Eugene V. Debs]] won 3.4%, despite being in prison at the time. It was also the first election in which [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women had the right to vote]] in all 48 states, which caused the total popular vote to increase dramatically, from 18.5 million in 1916 to 26.8 million in 1920.<ref>{{Cite web |author=David Leip |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ |title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections |website=Uselectionatlas.org |access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\n== Nominations ==\n=== Republican Party nomination ===\n{{Main|1920 Republican National Convention}}{{See also|Endorsements in the 1920 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Republican Disc.svg|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''1920 Republican Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[Warren G.

Roosevelt's health declined seriously in 1918, however, and he died on January 6, 1919. Attention then turned to the party's unsuccessful 1916 candidate, [[Charles Evans Hughes]], who had narrowly fallen short of defeating Wilson that year, but Hughes remained aloof as to the prospect of another run, and ultimately ruled himself out following the death of his daughter early in 1920.\n\nOn June 8, the [[1920 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] met in Chicago. The race was wide open, and soon the convention deadlocked between Major General [[Leonard Wood]] and Governor [[Frank Orren Lowden]] of Illinois.\n\nOther names placed in nomination included Senators [[Warren G. Harding]] from Ohio, [[Hiram Johnson]] from California, and [[Miles Poindexter]] from Washington, Governor [[Calvin Coolidge]] of Massachusetts, philanthropist [[Herbert Hoover]], and [[Columbia University]] President [[Nicholas Murray Butler|Nicholas M. Butler]]. Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert M. La Follette]] from Wisconsin was not formally placed in nomination, but received the votes of his state delegation nonetheless. Harding was nominated for president on the tenth ballot, after some delegates shifted their allegiances. The results of the ten ballots were as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\"  | Presidential Balloting, Republican National Convention 1920\n|-\n!

Daugherty]], Harding's political manager, who became [[United States Attorney General]] after his election. Before the convention, Daugherty was quoted as saying, \"I don't expect Senator Harding to be nominated on the first, second, or third ballots, but I think we can afford to take chances that about 11 minutes after two, Friday morning of the convention, when 15 or 12 weary men are sitting around a table, someone will say: 'Who will we nominate?' At that decisive time, the friends of Harding will suggest him and we can well afford to abide by the result.\" Daugherty's prediction described essentially what occurred, but historians Richard C. Bain and Judith H. Parris argue that Daugherty's prediction has been given too much weight in narratives of the convention.\n\nOnce the presidential nomination was finally settled, the party bosses and Sen. Harding recommended Wisconsin Sen. [[Irvine Lenroot]] to the delegates for the second spot, but the delegates revolted and nominated Coolidge, who was very popular over his handling of the [[Boston Police Strike]] from the year before.

While Vice-president [[Thomas R. Marshall]] had long held a desire to succeed Wilson, his indecisive handling of the situation around Wilson's illness and incapacity destroyed any credibility he had as a candidate, and in the end he did not formally put himself forward for the nomination.\n\nAlthough [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] (Wilson's son-in-law and former Treasury Secretary) was the strongest candidate, Wilson blocked his nomination in hopes a deadlocked convention would demand that he run for a third term, even though he was seriously ill, physically immobile, and in seclusion at the time. The Democrats, meeting in [[San Francisco]] between June 28 and July 6 (the first time a major party held its [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]] in an urban center on the Pacific coast), nominated another newspaper editor from Ohio, Governor [[James M. Cox]], as their presidential candidate, and 38-year-old Assistant Secretary of the Navy [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a fifth cousin of the late president Theodore Roosevelt, for vice-president.\n\nEarly favorites for the nomination had included McAdoo and Attorney General [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer]].

Debs]] was incarcerated at the Atlanta federal penitentiary at the time for advocating non-compliance with the draft during World War I. He received the largest number of popular votes ever received by a Socialist Party candidate in the United States, although not the largest percentage of the popular vote. Debs received double this percentage in the election of [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.presidentelect.org/e1912.html |title=1912 |publisher=President Elect |access-date=2016-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230191250/http://presidentelect.org/e1912.html |archive-date=December 30, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The 1920 election was Debs's fifth and last attempt to become president.<ref name=\"socialist\" />\n\nIn 1919, members of the Socialist Party who had come from Russian language federation of the party and other more radical groups within the party started to create their own papers and membership dues and cards. These members supported a platform that was similar to the [[Communist International]] and elected twelve of their members to the fifteen-member National Executive Committee. However, there was accusations of election irregularities and an Emergency Convention held on August 30, 1919, suspended seven of the party's twelve language federations and expelled the party affiliates in Michigan, Massachusetts, and Ohio. The more radical members of the party held a convention in New York City in June 1919, which was attended by 94 delegates from twenty states. A vote to create a new party was defeated by a vote of 55 to 38 causing 31 delegates to withdraw from the convention. These 31 delegates held their own convention in Chicago on September 1, where they founded the [[Communist Party USA]].<ref name=\"communist\">{{Cite book |last=Haynes |first=Fred |date=1924 |title=Social Politics in the United States |publisher=[[Riverside Insights|The Riverside Press Cambridge]]}}</ref> The [[Communist Party USA]] attempted to give its presidential nomination to Debs, but he declined the nomination.<ref name=\"socialist\" />\n\nThe Socialist Party held its 1919 convention in Chicago with 140 delegates in attendance. Twenty-six delegates, who were members of the party's left-wing, left the convention. These delegates attempted to unite with the Communist Party USA, but formed the [[Communist Labor Party of America]] on September 2, after those attempts failed.<ref name=\"communist\" />\n\nThe Socialist Party had 100,000 members before the splits, but it fell to 55,000 members while the Communist Party had 35,000 members and the Communist Labor Party had 10,000 members. The Communist Party claimed to have 60,000 members while the Communist Labor Party claimed to have 30,000 members. The United Communist Party was formed in May 1920 between the Communist Labor Party and some members of the Communist Party. The United Communist Party and the Communist Party united in December 1921 to form the [[Workers Party of America]].<ref name=\"communist\" />\n\nEdward Henry, who was a friend of Debs, [[Lena Morrow Lewis]], and [[Oscar Ameringer]] nominated Debs for the party's nomination on May 13, 1920, and the 134 delegates to the national convention voted unanimously to give him the nomination. [[Kate Richards O'Hare]], who was also in prison, was considered for the vice-presidential nomination, but [[Seymour Stedman]] was selected by a vote of 106 to 26, which was later made unanimous, in order to have one of the candidates campaign. [[James H. Maurer]] was also considered for the vice-presidential nomination, but he declined due to his duties as head of the Pennsylvania Federation of Labor. Debs accepted the presidential nomination in an Atlanta prison on May 29, after being notified by Seymour, [[James Oneal]], and [[Julius Gerber]].<ref name=\"socialist\">{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=H.

The wife of [[Charles Edward Russell]] claimed that the ghost of [[Susan B. Anthony]] told her to vote for Debs. Over 60,000 people donated to the Socialist Party's campaign fund. Gerber predicted that Debs would receive three million votes and that five Socialists would be elected to Congress. Debs received 913,693 votes with his largest amount of support coming from [[1920 United States presidential election in New York|New York]]. His vote total was over 50% more than what [[Allan L. Benson]] had received in the 1916 election. Debs later chose to not run for president in the 1924 election and instead supported [[Robert M.

Additionally, the international responsibilities engendered by the Allied victory in [[World War I]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] proved deeply unpopular, causing a reaction against Wilson, who had pushed especially hard for the latter.\n\n=== Ethnic issues ===\n{{Main|Irish Race Conventions|Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial}}\n[[File:Cox Roosevelt poster 1920.jpg|left|thumb|Poster for the 1920 Democratic presidential ticket]]\n[[Irish American]]s were powerful in the Democratic party, and groups such as [[Clan na Gael#New Departure 1879|Clan na Gael]] opposed going to war alongside their enemy Britain, especially after the violent suppression of the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916. Wilson won them over in 1917 by promising to ask Britain to give Ireland its independence. Wilson had won the presidential election of 1916 with strong support from German-Americans and Irish-Americans, largely because of his slogan \"He kept us out of war\" and the longstanding American policy of [[United States non-interventionism|isolationism]]. At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, however, he reneged on his commitments to the Irish-American community, who vehemently denounced him. His dilemma was that Britain was his war ally. Events such as the anti-British [[Black Tom explosion|Black Tom]] and [[Kingsland Explosion]]s in 1916 on American soil (in part the result of wartime Irish and German co-ordination) and the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|Irish anti-conscription crisis]] of 1918 were all embarrassing to recall in 1920.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/enemywithininsid00landrich |title=The enemy within; the inside story of German sabotage in America : Landau, Henry, b. 1892 : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |website=Archive.org |access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/ASEN/ConferencePapers/Plowman%20ASEN%20Paper%202009.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/ASEN/ConferencePapers/Plowman%20ASEN%20Paper%202009.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|title=Essay by M.

However the [[Easter Rising|1916 Easter Rising]] in Dublin had led to increased support for the more radical [[Sinn Féin]] who in 1919 formed the [[First Dáil]], effectively declaring Ireland independent, sparking the [[Irish War of Independence]]. Britain was to pass the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Government of Ireland Act]] in late 1920, by which Ireland would have 2 home-ruled states within the British empire. This satisfied Wilson. The provisions of these were inadequate to the supporters of the [[Irish Republic]], however, which claimed full [[sovereignty]]. This position was also supported by many Irish Americans. The [[American Committee for Relief in Ireland]] was set up in 1920 to assist victims of the [[Irish War of Independence]] of 1919–21. Some Irish-American Senators joined the \"[[irreconcilables]]\" who blocked the ratification of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and United States membership in the [[League of Nations]].\n\nWilson blamed the Irish Americans and [[German American]]s for the lack of popular support for his unsuccessful campaign to have the United States join the [[League of Nations]], saying, \"There is an organized propaganda against the League of Nations and against the treaty proceeding from exactly the same sources that the organized propaganda proceeded from which threatened this country here and there with disloyalty, and I want to say—I cannot say too often—any man who carries a hyphen about with him [i.e., a [[hyphenated American]]] carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=American Rhetoric: Woodrow Wilson -- \"Final Address in Support of the League of Nations\"|url=https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/wilsonleagueofnations.htm|access-date=2022-11-16|website=www.americanrhetoric.com}}</ref>\n\nOf the $5,500,000 raised by supporters of the Irish Republic in the United States in 1919–20, the Dublin parliament ([[Dáil Éireann (Irish Republic)|Dáil Éireann]]) voted in June 1920 to spend $500,000 on the American presidential election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1920062900018 |title=Dáil Éireann – 29/Jun/1920 MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN U.S.A |website=Oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie |date=2015-02-24 |access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref> How this money was spent remains unclear. Ironically, the lawyer who had advised the fundraisers was Franklin D. Roosevelt{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}, the losing vice-presidential candidate. In any case, the Irish American city machines sat on their hands during the election, allowing the Republicans to roll up unprecedented landslides in every major city.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} Many German-American Democrats voted Republican or stayed home, giving the GOP landslides in the rural Midwest.\n\n=== Campaign ===\n[[File:FDR and James M Cox cph.3b03395.jpg|thumb|left|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] and Cox at a campaign appearance in Washington, D.C.]]\nWilson had hoped for a \"solemn referendum\" on the [[League of Nations]], but did not get one. Harding waffled on the League, thereby keeping [[Idaho]] Senator [[William Borah]] and other Republican \"irreconcilables\" in line. Cox also hedged. He went to the [[White House]] to seek Wilson's blessing and apparently endorsed the League, but—upon discovering its unpopularity among Democrats—revised his position to one that would accept the League only with reservations, particularly on Article Ten, which would require the United States to participate in any war declared by the League (thus taking the same standpoint as Republican Senate leader [[Henry Cabot Lodge]]). As reporter Brand Whitlock observed, the League was an issue important in government circles, but rather less so to the electorate. He also noted that the campaign was not waged on issues: \"The people, indeed, do not know what ideas Harding or Cox represents; neither do Harding or Cox. Great is democracy.\"<ref>Sinclair, p. 168</ref> False rumors circulated that Senator Harding had \"Negro blood,\" but this did not greatly hurt Harding's election campaign.\n\nGovernor Cox made a whirlwind campaign that took him to rallies, train station speeches, and formal addresses, reaching audiences totaling perhaps two million, whereas Senator Harding relied upon a \"[[Front Porch Campaign]]\" similar to that of [[William McKinley]] in [[1896 United States presidential election|1896]]. It brought thousands of voters to [[Marion, Ohio]], where Harding spoke from his home. GOP campaign manager Will Hays spent some $8.1 million, nearly four times the money Cox's campaign spent. Hays used national advertising in a major way (with advice from adman [[Albert Lasker]]). The theme was Harding's own slogan \"America First\". Thus the Republican advertisement in ''Collier's Magazine'' for October 30, 1920, demanded, \"Let's be done with wiggle and wobble.\" The image presented in the ads was nationalistic, using catch phrases like \"absolute control of the United States by the United States,\" \"Independence means independence, now as in 1776,\" \"This country will remain American. Its next President will remain in our own country,\" and \"We decided long ago that we objected to foreign government of our people.\"<ref>Sinclair, p. 162</ref>\n\nOn election night, November 2, 1920, commercial radio broadcast coverage of election returns for the first time. Announcers at [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA-AM]] in [[Pittsburgh]] read telegraph ticker results over the air as they came in. This single station could be heard over most of the Eastern United States by the small percentage of the population that had radio receivers.\n\nHarding's landslide came from all directions except the South. Irish- and German-American voters who had backed Wilson and peace in [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]] now voted against Wilson and Versailles. \"A vote for Harding\", said the German-language press, \"is a vote against the persecutions suffered by German-Americans during the war\". Not one major German-language newspaper supported Governor Cox.<ref>Sinclair, p. 163</ref> Many [[Irish American]]s, bitterly angry at Wilson's refusal to help Ireland at Versailles, simply abstained from voting in the presidential election. This allowed the Republicans to mobilize the ethnic vote, and Harding swept the big cities.\n\n[[File:EugeneDebs.gif|thumb|[[Clifford Berryman]]'s cartoon depiction of [[Eugene V. Debs]]' campaign from prison.]]\nThis was the first election in which women from every state were allowed to vote, following the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] to the Constitution in August 1920 (just in time for the general election).\n\nTennessee's vote for Warren G. Harding marked the first time since the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] that even one of the eleven states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] had voted for a Republican presidential candidate. Tennessee had last been carried by a Republican when [[Ulysses S. Grant]] claimed it in [[1868 United States presidential election|1868]].\n\nEven though Cox lost badly, his running mate Franklin D. Roosevelt became a well-known political figure because of his active and energetic campaign. In 1928, he was elected [[Governor of New York]], and in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]] he was elected president. He remained in power until his death in 1945 as the longest-serving American president in history.\n\n=== Results ===\n\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1920Colorbrewer.gif|right|thumb|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for the winning candidate.

Robinson, p. 19</ref> Harding won in all twelve cities with populations above 500,000. Harding won a net vote total of 1,540,000 from the twelve largest cities which was the highest amount for any Republican and fifth highest for any candidate from 1920 to 1948.<ref name=\"book\">{{Cite book |last=Murphy |first=Paul |date=1974 |title=Political Parties In American History, Volume 3, 1890-present |publisher=[[G. P. Putnam's Sons]]}}</ref> The Democratic vote was almost exactly the vote from 1916, but the Republican vote nearly doubled, as did the \"other\" vote. As pointed out earlier, the great increase in the total number of votes is mainly attributable to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gave women the right to vote.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the counties (1,949) were carried by the Republicans. The Democrats carried only 1,101 counties, a smaller number than [[Alton B. Parker|Alton Parker]] had carried in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]] and consequently the smallest number during the [[Fourth Party System]] until that point ([[Al Smith]] would carry even fewer in [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]]). Not a single county was carried by the Democrats in the Pacific section, where they had carried 76 in 1916. In the [[Mountain States|Mountain section]] Cox carried only thirteen counties, seven of them located in New Mexico bordering Texas, whereas Wilson carried all but twenty-one Mountain Section counties in 1916. At least one county was lost in every section in the Union and in every state except [[South Carolina]] and [[Mississippi]]. Eleven counties in [[Texas]] recorded a plurality for Ferguson.<ref name=\"Polls\" />\n\nWilson had won the support of Americans of German, Italian, Irish, or Jewish descent in the 1916 election, but Cox lost in all of those demographics and received less support from Jewish voters than Debs. Harding received support from over 90% of black voters.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nThe distribution of the county vote accurately represents the overwhelming character of the majority vote. Harding received 60.35 percent of the total vote, the largest percentage in the Fourth Party System, exceeding [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]]. Although the Democratic share was 34.13 percent, in no section did its voting share sink below 24 percent, and in three sections, the Democrats topped the poll. The Democratic Party was still a significant opposition on national terms, even though Cox won only eleven states and had fewer votes in the electoral college than Parker had won in 1904. More than two-thirds of the Cox vote was in states carried by Harding. The distribution of the vote by counties, and the study of percentages in sections, states, and counties, seem to show that it was Wilson and foreign policies that received the brunt of attack, not the Democratic Party and the domestic proposals of the period 1896–1914.<ref>The Presidential Vote, 1896–1932, Edgar E. Robinson, pg. 21</ref>\n\nThis was also the third presidential election in which both major party candidates were registered in the same home state; the others have been in [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]], [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]], [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]], [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. \n\n[[File:United States Electoral College 1920.svg]]\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box| pv_footnote=| ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Warren G.

Dewey]] on the sixth presidential ballot of the [[1940 Republican National Convention]].\n\nRoosevelt, acutely aware of strong [[Isolationism|isolationist]] and [[United States non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] sentiment, promised there would be no involvement in foreign wars if he were re-elected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historycentral.com/FDR/FDR_1940Election.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125203751/http://www.historycentral.com/FDR/FDR_1940Election.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-25|title=FDR Campaigns For Re-election}}\"Roosevelt repeatedly promised that American boys would not have to fight overseas.

He criticized perceived incompetence and waste in the [[New Deal]], warned of the dangers of breaking the two-term tradition, and accused Roosevelt of secretly planning to take the country into World War II. However, Willkie's association with [[big business]] damaged his cause, as many [[Working class in the United States|working class]] voters blamed corporations and business leaders for the Great Depression.  Roosevelt led in all pre-election polls and won a comfortable victory; his margins, though still significant, were less decisive than they had been in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]] and [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]].\n\n==Nominations==\n===Democratic Party ===\n{{Main|1940 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1940 Democratic National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Democratic Disc.svg|65px|center|link=Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party (United States)]]<big>'''1940 Democratic Party ticket '''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#3333FF; width:200px;\"| [[Franklin D.

Walsh]]\n| 0.5\n|}\n\nThroughout the winter, spring, and summer of 1940, there was much speculation as to whether Roosevelt would break with longstanding tradition and run for an unprecedented third term. The two-term tradition, although not yet [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|enshrined in the Constitution]], had been established by [[George Washington]] when he refused to run for a third term in [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]]; other former presidents, such as [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]] had made serious attempts to run for a third term, but the former failed to be nominated, while the latter, forced to run on a third-party ticket, lost to [[Woodrow Wilson]] due to the split in the Republican vote. President Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement as to his willingness to be a candidate again, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as [[James Farley]], that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the Democratic nomination. However, as [[Nazi Germany]] swept through [[Western Europe]] and menaced the [[United Kingdom]] in the summer of 1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat. He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat the popular Willkie.<ref>James MacGregor Burns ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1956) pp 408-30.</ref>\n\nAt the July 1940 Democratic Convention in Chicago, Roosevelt easily swept aside challenges from Farley and [[John Nance Garner]], his vice-president. Garner was a Texas conservative who had turned against Roosevelt in his second term because of his liberal economic and social policies. As a result, Roosevelt decided to pick a new running mate, [[Henry A. Wallace]] from Iowa, his Secretary of Agriculture and an outspoken liberal. That choice was strenuously opposed by many of the party's conservatives, who felt Wallace was too radical and \"eccentric\" in his private life to be an effective running mate (he practiced [[New Age]] spiritual beliefs, and often consulted with the controversial Russian spiritual guru [[Nicholas Roerich]]). But Roosevelt insisted that without Wallace on the ticket he would decline re-nomination, and when [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] came to Chicago to vouch for Wallace, he won the vice-presidential nomination with 626 votes to 329 for House Speaker [[William B. Bankhead]] of Alabama.<ref>Richard Moe, ''Roosevelt's Second Act: The Election of 1940 and the Politics of War'' (2013).</ref>\n\n===Republican Party===\n{{Main|1940 Republican Party presidential primaries|1940 Republican National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Republican Disc.svg|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''1940 Republican Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[Wendell Willkie|{{color|white|Wendell Willkie}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"| [[Charles L.

James]]\n|1\n|\n|\n|}\n\nIn the months leading up to the opening of the 1940 [[Republican National Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, the Republican Party was deeply divided between the party's [[United States non-interventionism|isolationists]], who wanted to stay out of [[World War II]] at all costs, and the party's interventionists, who felt that the [[United Kingdom]] needed to be given all aid short of war to prevent [[Nazi Germany]] from conquering all of Europe. The three leading candidates for the Republican nomination - Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] from Ohio, Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]] from Michigan, and [[District Attorney]] [[Thomas E. Dewey]] from New York - were all isolationists to varying degrees.<ref>Michael D. Bowen, ''The Roots of Modern Conservatism: Dewey, Taft, and the Battle for the Soul of the Republican Party'' (2011).</ref>\n\nTaft was the leader of the conservative, isolationist wing of the Republican Party, and his main strength was in his native [[Midwestern United States]] and parts of the [[Southern United States]]. Dewey, the District Attorney for [[Manhattan]], had risen to national fame as the \"Gangbuster\" prosecutor who had sent numerous infamous [[American Mafia|Mafia]] figures to prison, most notably [[Lucky Luciano]], the organized-crime boss of [[New York City]]. Dewey had won most of the presidential primaries in the spring of 1940, and he came into the Republican Convention in June with the largest number of delegate votes, although he was still well below the number needed to win. Vandenberg, the senior Republican in the Senate, was the \"favorite son\" candidate of the Michigan delegation and was considered a possible compromise candidate if Taft or Dewey faltered. Former President [[Herbert Hoover]] was also spoken of as a compromise candidate.\n\nHowever, each of these candidates had weaknesses that could be exploited. Taft's outspoken isolationism and opposition to any American involvement in the [[European theatre of World War II|European war]] convinced many Republican leaders that he could not win a general election, particularly as [[Battle of France|France fell]] to the Nazis in June 1940 and Germany threatened the United Kingdom. Dewey's relative youth—he was only 38 in 1940—and lack of any foreign-policy experience caused his candidacy to weaken as the [[Wehrmacht]] emerged as a fearsome threat. In 1940, Vandenberg was also an isolationist (he would change his foreign-policy stance during World War II) and his lackadaisical, lethargic campaign never caught the voters' attention. Hoover still bore the stigma of having presided over the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the subsequent [[Great Depression]]. This left an opening for a [[dark horse]] candidate to emerge.<ref>Susan Dunn,  ''1940: FDR, Willkie, Lindbergh, Hitler-the Election Amid the Storm'' (Yale UP, 2013).</ref>\n\n[[File:Willkie For President button.svg|thumb|right|Wendell Willkie for President campaign button.]]\n\nA [[Wall Street]]-based industrialist named [[Wendell Willkie]], who had never before run for public office, emerged as the unlikely nominee. Willkie, a native of Indiana and a former Democrat who had supported Franklin Roosevelt in the [[1932 United States presidential election]], was considered an improbable choice. Willkie had first come to public attention as an articulate critic of Roosevelt's attempt to break up electrical power [[Monopoly|monopolies]].\n\nWillkie was the CEO of the [[Commonwealth & Southern Corporation]], which provided electrical power to customers in eleven states. In 1933, President Roosevelt had created the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA), which promised to provide [[flood control]] and cheap electricity to the impoverished people of the [[Tennessee Valley]]. However, the government-run TVA would compete with Willkie's Commonwealth & Southern, and this led Willkie to criticize and oppose the TVA's attempt to compete with private power companies. Willkie argued that the government had unfair advantages over private corporations, and should thus avoid competing directly against them.<ref>Steve Neal, ''Dark Horse: A Biography of Wendell Willkie'' (1989)</ref>\n\nHowever, Willkie did not dismiss all of Roosevelt's [[Social programs in the United States|social welfare programs]], indeed supporting those he believed could not be managed any better by the free enterprise system. Furthermore, unlike the leading Republican candidates, Willkie was a forceful and outspoken advocate of aid to the [[Allies of World War II]], especially the United Kingdom. His support of giving all aid to the British \"short of declaring war\" won him the support of many Republicans on the [[East Coast of the United States]], who disagreed with their party's isolationist leaders in Congress.\n\nWillkie's persuasive arguments impressed these Republicans, who believed that he would be an attractive presidential candidate. Many of the leading [[Media proprietor|press barons]] of the era, such as Ogden Reid of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', Roy Howard of the [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps-Howard]] newspaper chain and [[John Cowles Sr.|John]] and [[Gardner Cowles Jr.]] publishers of the ''[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star]]'' and the ''[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Tribune]]'', as well as ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'' and ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine, supported Willkie in their newspapers and magazines. Even so, Willkie remained a long-shot candidate; the May 8 [[The Gallup Organization#Gallup Poll|Gallup Poll]] showed Dewey at 67% support among Republicans, followed by Vandenberg and Taft, with Willkie at only 3%.\n\nThe [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]'s rapid [[Blitzkrieg]] campaign into France in May 1940 shook American public opinion, even as Taft was telling a Kansas audience that America needed to concentrate on domestic issues to prevent Roosevelt from using the war crisis to extend [[socialism]] at home. Both Dewey and Vandenberg also continued to oppose any aid to the United Kingdom that might lead to war with Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, sympathy for the embattled British was mounting daily, and this aided Willkie's candidacy. By mid-June, little over one week before the Republican Convention opened, the Gallup poll reported that Willkie had moved into second place with 17%, and that Dewey was slipping. Fueled by his favorable media attention, Willkie's pro-British statements won over many of the delegates. As the delegates were arriving in Philadelphia, Gallup reported that Willkie had surged to 29%, Dewey had slipped five more points to 47%, and Taft, Vandenberg and Hoover trailed at 8%, 8%, and 6% respectively.\n\nHundreds of thousands, perhaps as many as one million, telegrams urging support for Willkie poured in, many from \"Willkie Clubs\" that had sprung up across the country. Millions more signed petitions circulating everywhere. At the [[1940 Republican National Convention]] itself, keynote speaker [[Harold Stassen]], the Governor of Minnesota, announced his support for Willkie and became his official floor manager.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Hundreds of vocal Willkie supporters packed the upper galleries of the convention hall. Willkie's amateur status and fresh face appealed to delegates as well as voters. Most of the delegations were selected not by primaries, but by party leaders in each state, and they had a keen sense of the fast-changing pulse of public opinion. Gallup found the same thing in polling data not reported until after the convention: Willkie had moved ahead among Republican voters by 44% to only 29% for the collapsing Dewey. As the pro-Willkie galleries chanted \"We Want Willkie!\" the delegates on the convention floor began their vote. Dewey led on the first ballot, but steadily lost strength thereafter. Both Taft and Willkie gained in strength on each ballot, and by the fourth ballot it was obvious that either Willkie or Taft would be the nominee. The key moments came when the delegations of large states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York left Dewey and Vandenberg and switched to Willkie, giving him the victory on the sixth ballot.<ref>Henry Z.

Magazine Articles |work=Coronet|date=January 1941 |access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref> However, the American Institute of Public Opinion, responsible for the Gallup Poll, avoided predicting the outcome, citing a four percent margin of error.<ref>[[Daniel Katz (psychologist)|Katz, Daniel]] (March 1941). \"The Public Opinion Polls and the 1940 Election\". ''The Public Opinion Quarterly''. Vol. 5, No. 1, pp. 52–78</ref> The Gallup Poll also found that, if there was [[European theatre of World War II|no war in Europe]], voters preferred Willkie over Roosevelt.<ref name=\"gallup1941\"/>\n\n===Fall campaign===\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1940Colorbrewer.gif|thumb|right|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for the winning candidate. Shades of blue are for Roosevelt (Democratic) and shades of red are for Willkie (Republican).]]\nWillkie crusaded against Roosevelt's attempt to break the two-term presidential tradition, arguing that \"if one man is indispensable, then none of us is free.\" Even some Democrats who had supported Roosevelt in the past disapproved of his attempt to win a third term, and Willkie hoped to win their votes. Willkie also criticized what he claimed was the incompetence and waste in Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] welfare programs. He stated that as president he would keep most of Roosevelt's government programs, but would make them more efficient.<ref>John W. Jeffries,  ''A Third Term for FDR: The Election of 1940'' (2017)</ref>\n\nHowever, many Americans still blamed business leaders for the Great Depression, and the fact that Willkie symbolized \"[[Big business|Big Business]]\" hurt him with many [[Working class in the United States|working-class voters]]. Willkie was a fearless campaigner; he often visited industrial areas where Republicans were still blamed for causing the Great Depression and where Roosevelt was highly popular. In these areas, Willkie frequently had rotten fruit and vegetables thrown at him and was heckled by crowds; still, he was unfazed.<ref>* Evjen, Henry O. \"The Willkie Campaign; An Unfortunate Chapter in Republican Leadership\", ''Journal of Politics'' (1952) 14#2 pp. 241–56 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2126521 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nWillkie also accused Roosevelt of leaving the nation unprepared for war, but Roosevelt's military buildup and transformation of the nation into the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\" removed the \"unpreparedness\" charge as a major issue. Willkie then reversed his approach and charged Roosevelt with secretly planning to take the nation into World War II. This accusation did cut into Roosevelt's support. In response, Roosevelt, in a pledge that he would later regret, promised that he would \"not send American boys into any foreign wars.\"  The United Kingdom actively intervened throughout the election against isolationism.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Usdin|first1=Steve|title=When a Foreign Government Interfered in a U.S. Election — to Reelect FDR|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/when-a-foreign-government-interfered-in-a-us-electionto-reelect-fdr-214634|access-date=18 January 2017|work=[[Politico]]|date=16 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Results===\nRoosevelt [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections#United States presidential election, 1940|led in all pre-election opinion polls]] by various margins. On Election Day—November 5, 1940, he received 27.3 million votes to Willkie's 22.3 million, and in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], he defeated Willkie by a margin of 449 to 82. Willkie did get over six million more votes than the Republican nominee in 1936, [[Alf Landon]], and he ran strong in [[rural]] areas in the American [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], taking over 57% of the farm vote. Many counties in the Midwest have not voted for a Democrat since. Roosevelt, meanwhile, carried every American city with a population of more than 400,000 except [[Cincinnati]], Ohio. Of the 106 cities with more than 100,000 population, he won 61% of the votes cast; in the [[Southern United States]] as a whole, he won 73% of the total vote. In the remainder of the country (the rural and small-town [[Northern United States]]), Willkie had a majority of 53%. In the cities, there was a class differential, with the white-collar and middle-class voters supporting the Republican candidate, and working class, blue-collar voters going for FDR. In the North, Roosevelt won 87% of the Jewish vote, 73% of the Catholics, and 61% of the nonmembers, while all the major Protestant denominations showed majorities for Willkie.<ref>Richard Jensen,  \"The Cities Reelect Roosevelt\" p 189-90</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's net vote totals in the twelve largest cities decreased from 3,479,000 votes in the 1936 election to 2,112,000 votes, but it was still higher than his result from the 1932 election when he won by 1,791,000 votes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Paul |date=1974 |title=Political Parties In American History, Volume 3, 1890-present |publisher=[[G. P. Putnam's Sons]]}}</ref> Of the 3,094 counties/independent cities, Roosevelt won in 1,947 (62.93%) while Willkie carried 1,147 (37.07%).\n\n===Records===\nRoosevelt was the third of just four presidents in United States history to win re-election with a lower percentage of the electoral vote than in their prior elections, the other three were [[James Madison]] in [[1812 United States presidential election|1812]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] in [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]] and [[Barack Obama]] in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]]. Additionally, Roosevelt was the fourth of only five presidents to win re-election with a smaller percentage of the popular vote than in prior elections, the other four are [[James Madison]] in [[1812 United States presidential election|1812]], [[Andrew Jackson]] in [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], [[Grover Cleveland]] in [[1892 United States presidential election|1892]], and Obama in 2012. This marked the first time since 1892, that the Democrats won the popular vote in three consecutive elections, and the first since 1840, where they won three consecutive elections. Although at a rate lower than 1936, Roosevelt maintained his strong majorities from labor unions, big city [[political machine]]s, ethnic minority voters, and the traditionally Democratic [[Solid South]]. Roosevelt's third consecutive victory inspired the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], limiting the number of terms a person may be president.\n\nAs of 2023, Roosevelt was the sixth of seven presidential nominees to win a significant number of electoral votes in at least three elections, the others being Thomas Jefferson, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, Grover Cleveland, William Jennings Bryan, and Richard Nixon. Of these, Jackson, Cleveland, and Roosevelt also won the popular vote in at least three elections. Jefferson, Cleveland, and Roosevelt were also their respective party's nominees for three consecutive elections.\n\nThis was the first time that North Dakota voted for a losing candidate and the first time since 1892 that a Democrat won without Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska. This was also the first time anyone won without Colorado and Nebraska since 1908, and Kansas since 1900.  It was also the fourth presidential election in which both major party candidates were registered in the same home state; the others have been in [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]], [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]], [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. \n\nWillkie and McNary both died in 1944 (October 8, and February 25, respectively); the first, and to date only time both members of a major-party presidential ticket died during the term for which they sought election. Had they been elected, Willkie's death would have resulted in the Secretary of State becoming [[Acting president of the United States|acting president]] for the remainder of the term ending on January 20, 1945, in accordance with the [[Presidential Succession Act#Presidential Succession Act of 1886|Presidential Succession Act of 1886]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brewer|first=F.|date=1945|title=Succession to the presidency|work=Editorial research reports 1945 (Vol. II)|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre1945092000|url-access=registration|access-date=July 12, 2018|quote=If the Republican ticket had been elected in 1940, the plan of succession adopted in 1886 would probably have come into operation for the first time in 1944.

It was held on Tuesday, November 8, 1960. In a closely contested election, [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]  Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] defeated the incumbent Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee. This was the first election in which 50 states participated, marking the first participation of Alaska and Hawaii, and the last in which the District of Columbia did not. This made it the only presidential election where the threshold for victory was 269 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. It was also the first election in which an incumbent president –in this case, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]– was ineligible to run for a third term because of the term limits established by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]].\n\n[[File:Dwight D. Eisenhower, White House photo portrait, February 1959.jpg|thumb|189x189px|The [[incumbent]] in 1960, Dwight D. Eisenhower. His second term expired at noon on January 20, 1961.]]\n\nThis was the most recent election in which three of the four major party nominees for president and vice president were eventually elected president. Kennedy won the election, but [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|was assassinated in 1963]] and succeeded by Johnson, who won the election in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Then, Nixon won the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]]. Of the four candidates, only Republican vice-presidential nominee [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] failed to succeed to the presidency. As such, this was also the most recent election in which the defeated presidential nominee would later win the presidency.\n\nThe election saw the first time that a candidate won the presidency while carrying fewer states than the other candidate, something that would not occur again until [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]]. When Kennedy was elected, he became the youngest president elected to the presidency at 43 years, while [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was still the youngest President at 42 years and 10 months when he became [[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt|president]] in [[First inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt|September 1901]] following the death of president [[William McKinley]]. No matter which candidate won, America would elect its first President born in the 20th century (Kennedy was born in 1917, Nixon in 1913). Nixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Kennedy, a junior senator from [[Massachusetts]], established himself as the Democratic front-runner with his strong performance in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1960|1960 Democratic primaries]], including key victories in Wisconsin and West Virginia over Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]]. He defeated Senate Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on the first presidential ballot of the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], and asked Johnson to serve as his running mate. The issue of the [[Cold War]] dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nKennedy won a 303-to-219 [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] victory, and he won the reported national popular vote by 112,827, a margin of 0.17 percent. Fourteen [[unpledged elector]]s from Mississippi and Alabama cast their vote for Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]], as did a [[faithless elector]] from Oklahoma. The 1960 presidential election was the closest election since [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]], and this closeness can be explained by a number of factors.<ref>Rorabaugh (2009)</ref> Kennedy benefited from the [[Recession of 1958|economic recession of 1957–1958]], which hurt the standing of the incumbent Republican Party, and he had the advantage of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ann Mari |last=May |title=President Eisenhower, Economic Policy, and the 1960 Presidential Election |journal=[[Journal of Economic History]] |volume=50 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=417–427 |jstor=2123282 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700036536|s2cid=45404782 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&context=cbafacpub }}</ref> Furthermore, the new votes that Kennedy, the first [[Roman Catholic]] president, gained among Catholics almost neutralized the new votes Nixon gained among [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestants]].<ref>Casey (2009)</ref> Nixon's advantages came from Eisenhower's popularity, as well as the economic prosperity of the past eight years. Kennedy's campaigning skills decisively outmatched Nixon's, who exhausted time and resources campaigning in all fifty states, while Kennedy focused on campaigning in populous [[swing states]]. Kennedy emphasized his youth, while Nixon focused heavily on his experience. Kennedy relied on Johnson to hold the South, and used television effectively. Despite this, Kennedy's popular vote margin was the second narrowest in presidential history, only surpassed by the 0.11% margin of the [[1880 United States presidential election|election of 1880]] and the smallest ever for a Democrat (notwithstanding the presidential elections where [[List of United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|the winners lost the popular vote]]).\n\n==Nominations==\n===Democratic Party===\n{{main|1960 Democratic Party presidential primaries}}\n{{John F.

Johnson]] from Texas, former nominee [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], Senator [[Wayne Morse]] from Oregon, and Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] from Minnesota. Several other candidates sought support in their home state or region as \"[[favorite son]]\" candidates, without any realistic chance of winning the nomination. Symington, Stevenson, and Johnson all declined to campaign in the presidential primaries. While this reduced their potential delegate count going into the Democratic National Convention, each of these three candidates hoped that the other leading contenders would stumble in the primaries, thus causing the convention's delegates to choose him as a \"compromise\" candidate acceptable to all factions of the party.\n\nKennedy was initially dogged by suggestions from some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] elders (such as former United States President [[Harry S. Truman]], who was supporting Symington) that he was too youthful and inexperienced to be president; these critics suggested that he should agree to be the [[running mate]] for another Democrat. Realizing that this was a strategy touted by his opponents to keep the public from taking him seriously, Kennedy stated frankly, \"I'm not running for vice president; I'm running for president.\"<ref>[[Jeff Zeleny|Zeleny, Jeff]]; Bosman, Julie (March 11, 2008).

Kennedy's [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religion was an issue. Kennedy first challenged Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey in the Wisconsin primary, and defeated him. Kennedy's sisters, brothers, and wife Jacqueline combed the state, looking for votes, leading Humphrey to complain that he \"felt like an independent merchant competing against a chain store.\"<ref>Humphrey, Hubert H.

The first televised debate of 1960 was held in West Virginia. Kennedy outperformed Humphrey and, in the days following, Kennedy made substantial gains over Humphrey in the polls.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reston |first=James |date=May 5, 1960 |title=Sen.

It was assumed Humphrey's campaign had sent them, and it may have helped tilt voters in the Badger State away from him (it later came out that [[Robert F. Kennedy]] had deployed an assistant to mail the pamphlets). In the end, Kennedy defeated Humphrey with over 60% of the vote, and Humphrey ended his presidential campaign. West Virginia showed that Kennedy, a Catholic, could win in a heavily Protestant state.

Even though Stevenson had twice been the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, and retained a loyal following of liberals, his two landslide defeats to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] United States President [[Dwight Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower]] led most party leaders and delegates to search for a \"fresh face\" who could win a national election. Following the primaries, Kennedy traveled around the nation, speaking to state delegations and their leaders. As the Democratic Convention opened, Kennedy was far in the lead, but was still seen as being just short of the delegate total he needed to win.\n\n====Democratic convention====\nThe [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] was held in Los Angeles, California. In the week before the convention opened, Kennedy received two new challengers, when Lyndon B. Johnson, the powerful Senate Majority Leader, and Adlai Stevenson, the party's nominee in 1952 and 1956, officially announced their candidacies. However, neither Johnson nor Stevenson was a match for the talented and highly efficient Kennedy campaign team led by Robert Kennedy. Johnson challenged Kennedy to a televised debate before a joint meeting of the Texas and Massachusetts delegations, which Kennedy accepted. Most observers believed that Kennedy won the debate, and Johnson was unable to expand his delegate support beyond the South. Stevenson's failure to launch his candidacy publicly until the week of the convention meant that many liberal delegates who might have supported him were already pledged to Kennedy, and Stevenson – despite the energetic support of former First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] – could not break their allegiance. Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot.\n\nThen, in a move that surprised many, Kennedy asked Johnson to be his running mate. He realized that he could not be elected without the support of traditional [[Southern Democrats]], most of whom had backed Johnson. He offered Johnson the vice presidential nomination at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel]] at 10:15&nbsp;a.m. on July 14, 1960, the morning after being nominated for president.<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121–135.

Schlesinger Jr.]], ''Robert Kennedy and His Times'' (1978), pp. 206–211.</ref>\n\nBiographers [[Robert Caro]] and [[W. Marvin Watson]] offer a different perspective: they write that the Kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close race against Nixon and Lodge. Johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry votes from Texas and the Southern United States. Caro's research showed that on July 14, Kennedy started the process, while Johnson was still asleep. At 6:30&nbsp;a.m., Kennedy asked his brother to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes, \"including Texas\".<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121–135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> Robert Kennedy called [[Pierre Salinger]] and [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] to assist him. Realizing the ramifications of counting Texas votes as their own, Salinger asked him whether he was considering a Kennedy–Johnson ticket, and Robert replied, \"Yes\".<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121–135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> Between 9 and 10&nbsp;am, John Kennedy called Pennsylvania governor [[David L. Lawrence]], a Johnson backer, to request that Lawrence nominate Johnson for vice president if Johnson were to accept the role, and then went to Johnson's suite to discuss a mutual ticket at 10:15&nbsp;am. John Kennedy then returned to his suite to announce the Kennedy–Johnson ticket to his closest supporters and Northern political bosses. He accepted the congratulations of Ohio Governor [[Michael DiSalle]], Connecticut Governor [[Abraham A. Ribicoff]], New York City mayor [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.]], and Chicago mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]. Lawrence said that \"Johnson has the strength where you need it most\"; he then left to begin writing the nomination speech.<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121–135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> O'Donnell remembers being angry at what he considered a betrayal by John Kennedy, who had previously cast Johnson as anti-labor and anti-liberal. Afterward, Robert Kennedy visited with labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of Johnson, and, after seeing the depth of labor opposition to Johnson, he ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and Johnson, apparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without John Kennedy's authorization and to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman, rather than vice president. Johnson refused to accept a change in plans, unless it came directly from John Kennedy. Despite his brother's interference, John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate, and met with staffers such as [[Larry O'Brien]], his national campaign manager, to say Johnson was to be vice president. O'Brien recalled later that John Kennedy's words were wholly unexpected, but that, after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation, he thought \"it was a stroke of genius\".<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121–135.

Eisenhower could not run for the office of president again; he had been elected in 1952 and 1956.\n\nIn 1959, it looked as if Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] might face a serious challenge for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination from New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the leader of the Republican moderate-to-liberal wing. However, Rockefeller announced that he would not be a candidate for president, after a national tour revealed that the great majority of Republicans favored Nixon.<ref>(White, pp. 91–92)</ref>\n\nAfter Rockefeller's withdrawal, Nixon faced no significant opposition for the Republican nomination. At the [[1960 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], Nixon was the overwhelming choice of the delegates, with conservative Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] from Arizona receiving 10 votes from conservative delegates. In earning the nomination, Nixon became the first sitting vice president to run for president since [[John C. Breckinridge]] exactly a century prior. Nixon then chose former Massachusetts Senator and United Nations Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], as his vice presidential running mate. Nixon chose Lodge because his foreign-policy credentials fit into Nixon's strategy to campaign more on foreign policy than domestic policy, which he believed favored the Democrats. Nixon had previously sought Rockefeller as his running mate, but the governor had no ambitions to be vice president. However, he later served as [[Gerald Ford]]'s vice president from 1974 to 1977.<ref>(White, pp. 242–243)</ref>\n\n==General election==\n\n===Campaign promises===\n[[File:Dwight David Eisenhower, photo portrait by Bachrach, 1952.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the incumbent president in 1960, whose term expired on January 20, 1961]]\nDuring the campaign, Kennedy charged that under Eisenhower and the Republicans, the nation had fallen behind the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]], both militarily and economically, and that, as president, he would \"get America moving again\". The Eisenhower administration had established NASA in 1958, but Kennedy believed that the Republican Party had ignored the need to catch up to the Soviet Union in the [[Space Race]]. He promised that the new Democratic administration would fully appreciate the importance of space accomplishments for the national security and international prestige of the United States. Nixon responded that, if elected, he would continue the \"peace and prosperity\" that Eisenhower had brought the nation in the 1950s. Nixon also argued that, with the nation engaged in the Cold War with the Soviets, Kennedy was too young and inexperienced to be trusted with the presidency. Had Nixon been elected, at 48 years, 11 days, he would have been [[List of presidents of the United States by age|the fourth-youngest]] president at the date of inauguration. Kennedy, by contrast, was 43 years, 236 days, on the date of his inauguration; the second-youngest man to begin a Presidency. (At 42 [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who [[First inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt|assumed the Presidency]] upon the [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination of United States President William McKinley]] 60 years previously, was (and remains) the youngest.)\n\nDuring Kennedy's campaign, he relied on his youth and promised to bring about change. Kennedy had a slogan emphasizing his youth, reading, \"who's seasoned through and through/but not so dog-gone seasoned that he won't try something new.\" He was also endorsed by celebrities such as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Henry Fonda]], and [[Harry Belafonte]]. Nixon asserted that his experience in politics made him more qualified to hold the office of president. He wanted voters to know that he had the abilities to take on communist threats.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Byung Joon|date=September 2016|title=Attacking the Airwaves: How Television Changed the American Presidential Campaign|journal=The New England Journal of History|volume=73|pages=1–27}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign events===\n[[File:John F.

However, Nixon was plagued by bad luck throughout the fall campaign. In August, President Eisenhower, who had long been ambivalent about Nixon, held a televised press conference in which a reporter, [[Charles Mohr (journalist)|Charles Mohr]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', mentioned Nixon's claims that he had been a valuable administration insider and adviser. Mohr asked Eisenhower if he could give an example of a major idea of Nixon's that he had heeded. Eisenhower responded with the flip comment, \"If you give me a week, I might think of one.\"<ref>Ambrose, Stephen E. (1991). ''Eisenhower: Soldier and President'', p. 525. Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-74758-4}}.</ref> Although both Eisenhower and Nixon later claimed that he was merely joking with the reporter, the remark hurt Nixon, as it undercut his claims of having greater decision-making experience than Kennedy. The remark proved so damaging to Nixon that the Democrats turned Eisenhower's statement into a television commercial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nixon's Experience? (Kennedy, 1960)|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1960/nixons-experience|website=The Living Room Candidate|publisher=[[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]]|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAt the Republican National Convention, Nixon had pledged to campaign in all fifty states. This pledge backfired when, in August, Nixon injured his knee on a car door, while campaigning in North Carolina. The knee became infected, and Nixon had to cease campaigning for two weeks, while the infection was treated with [[Antibacterial|antibiotics]]. When he left [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]], Nixon refused to abandon his pledge to visit every state; he thus wound up wasting valuable time visiting states that he had no chance of winning, that had few electoral votes and would be of little help at the election, or states that he would almost certainly win regardless. In his effort to visit all 50 states, Nixon spent the vital weekend before the election campaigning in Alaska, which had only three electoral votes, while Kennedy campaigned in more populous states such as New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Nixon's unfriendly relations with the media, which dated back to the [[Checkers speech|\"Fund\" scandal]] eight years earlier, were a persistent liability to him. The Washington D.C. press corps, around 100 members, were largely liberal Democrats and by nature inclined to favor Kennedy, but Nixon often made things worse with his mutually antagonistic attitude towards them. Many of Nixon's stump speeches were filled with folksy homilies that resonated with rural and small town Americans, but were distasteful to the elitist D.C. reporters. [[Mary McGrory]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said he was \"just so icky, so yucky, humorless, self-righteous and smarmy.\" However, more important than that was the adulation the press had for Kennedy; as the campaign drew to its terminal phase, this love of the Massachusetts Senator took on an almost messianic fervor. Kennedy was expert at using this to his advantage and flattered reporters instead of arguing with them.\n\nNixon visited [[Atlanta]], Georgia, on August 26, and acquired a very large turnout to his event. He rode through a parade in Atlanta, and was greeted by 150,000 people.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Nixon-Kennedy Campaigns In Georgia|last=Fleming|first=K|date=November 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal and Constitution}}</ref> Nixon mentioned in his speech in Atlanta, \"In the last quarter of a century, there hasn't been a Democratic candidate for President that has bothered to campaign in the State of Georgia.\"<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25759|title=John F.

Kennedy would change that statistic, and visit some surprising states, including Georgia. He visited the cities of [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], [[Warm Springs, Georgia|Warm Springs]], and [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]] on his campaign trail in Georgia. In his visit to Warm Springs, state troopers tried to keep Kennedy from an immense crowd; however, Kennedy reached out to shake hands of those who were sick with [[polio]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cheering Throng Engulfs Kennedy|last=Galphin|first=B|date=October 11, 1960|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution}}</ref> He also visited small towns across Georgia and saw a total of about 100,000 people in the state. Kennedy also spoke at a rehabilitation facility in Warm Springs. Warm Springs was near and dear to Kennedy's heart, due to the effects the facility had on [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt spent time at the rehabilitation facility, and died there in 1945.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\"/>\n\nIn Warm Springs, Kennedy spoke to supporters at the facility, and mentioned Roosevelt in his speech. He admired Roosevelt, and commended him for sticking up for the farmers, workers, small towns, big cities, those in poverty, and those who were sick.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\" /> He said Roosevelt had a \"spirit of strength and progress, to get America moving\".<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\"/> Kennedy discussed his six-point plan for health care. He wanted a medical program set up for retirement, and federal funding for the construction of medical schools and hospitals. He also planned for the government to loan students money to attend medical school, and provide grants to renovate old hospitals. He called for more money to be spent on medical research and, finally, expand effort for rehabilitation and come up with new ways to assist those in need.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\"/> Many Republicans disapproved of Kennedy's plans and described them as an \"appeal to socialism\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Kennedy's Plans Altered: Crowd of 50,000 Is Seen|last=Gaines|first=Marion|date=October 6, 1960|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution}}</ref> Nevertheless, many residents of Warm Springs were supportive of Kennedy, with women wearing hats reading \"Kennedy and Johnson\" and<ref>{{Cite news|title=Women Dressed in Support of John F. Kennedy's Presidential Campaign, Little White House, Warm Springs, Georgia|last=Johnson|first=Marion|date=October 10, 1960|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution}}</ref> signs around the town saying \"Douglas County For Kennedy, Except 17 Republicans 6 Old Grouches\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=A Sign of Votes at Warm Springs|last=Stovall|first=Hugh|date=October 11, 1960|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution}}</ref> Joe O. Butts, the mayor of Warm Springs during Kennedy's visit, said: \"He must've shaken hands with everybody within two miles of him, and he was smiling all the time.\"<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nEisenhower remained out of the fray until the general election in the fall, when it was agreed that he should take to the campaign trail in support of Nixon. The president was very much a party man, and although he had some antipathies towards his vice president, he badly wanted the White House to remain in Republican control and also feared that Kennedy was too young and inexperienced for the job. Eisenhower came out in a \"cyclonic\" campaign, making a series of fiery speeches in the swing states of New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania in support of Nixon and denouncing Democrat charges that he had neglected military preparedness. As the poll numbers with Kennedy narrowed to a close, Eisenhower's \"fall offensive\" was cut short by his own wife. [[Mamie Eisenhower]] was horrified to hear of this and became convinced that he would kill himself due to his bad heart. She phoned Nixon and told him he'd better tell the president to stop this right now, before something happened. Nixon had a luncheon with Eisenhower on October 3, but he was unable to explain exactly why his help in this campaign wasn't needed, instead clumsily beating around the bush. Eisenhower was surprised and slightly annoyed, but agreed to stop campaigning.\n\nDespite the reservations [[Robert F. Kennedy]] had about Johnson's nomination, choosing Johnson as Kennedy's running mate proved to be a master stroke. Johnson vigorously campaigned for Kennedy, and was instrumental in helping the Democrats to carry several Southern states skeptical of him, especially Johnson's home state of Texas. Johnson made a \"last-minute change of plans, and scheduled two 12-minute whistlestop speeches in Georgia\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Johnson Due in State Tonight|date=October 11, 1960|work=The Atlanta Constitution}}</ref> One of these visits included stopping in Atlanta to speak from the rear of a train at [[Terminal Station (Atlanta)|Terminal Station]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|title=New President Johnson An Old Friend to Georgia|date=November 23, 1963|work=The Atlanta Constitution}}</ref> On the other hand, Ambassador Lodge, Nixon's running mate, ran a lethargic campaign and made several mistakes that hurt Nixon. Among them was a pledge, made without approval, that Nixon would name at least one African American to a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] post. Nixon was furious at Lodge and accused him of spending too much time campaigning with minority groups instead of the white majority.<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=Theodore H. |title=The Making of the President, 1960 |date=2009 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=Pymble, NSW |isbn=978-0-061-98601-7 |page=297}}</ref>\n\nNixon's inability to carry the African-American vote was another of many missteps in his campaign. Eisenhower had scored 40% of black votes four years earlier, and Nixon assumed he would perform as well with his strong support of civil rights. However, several missteps including the Lodge \"pledge\" and Nixon's refusal to comment on Martin Luther King Jr.'s arrest in Atlanta harmed his support with black voters. Attempts by the Nixon campaign to counter this were not very successful as they were out-spent three to one. Ultimately, Nixon won just 30% of the black vote (compared to Eisenhower's 40%) on Election Day and strong black turnout for Kennedy in several important states including Illinois and South Carolina may have contributed to his defeat.\n\n===Debates===\n{{Main|1960 United States presidential debates}}\nThere were [[1960 United States presidential debates|four presidential debates]] and no vice presidential debates during the 1960 general election.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.debates.org/index.php?page=1960-debates|title=CPD: 1960 Debates|website=www.debates.org|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Debates among candidates for the 1960 U.S. presidential election'''\n!No.\n!Date\n!Host\n!Location\n!Panelists\n!Moderator\n!Participants\n!Viewership<br/>(millions)\n|-\n|P1\n|Monday, September 26, 1960\n|[[WBBM-TV]]\n|[[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]\n|[[Sander Vanocur]]<br>Charles Warren<br>[[Stuart Novins]]\n|[[Howard K.

Moreover, since 87% of American households had a television in 1960 [and that the] fraction of Americans lacking access to television in 1960 was concentrated in rural areas, and particularly in southern and western states, places that were unlikely to hold significant proportions of Catholic voters.<ref name=schlinder>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.las.illinois.edu/salthaus/Publications/media%20and%20politics%20encyclopedia_kennedy-nixon%20debates.pdf|author=Scott L.

The Kennedy-Johnson ticket was the first successful all Senator ticket, which would only be replicated in 2008. \n\nThis election marked the beginning of a decisive realignment in the Democratic presidential coalition; whereas Democrats had until this point relied on dominating in Southern states to win the electoral college, Kennedy managed to win without carrying a number of these states. As such, this marked the first election in history in which a Republican candidate carried any of Oklahoma, Tennessee, Kentucky, Florida, Virginia, or Idaho without winning the presidency, and the first time since statehood that Arizona backed any losing candidate in a presidential election.

Kennedy's defenders, such as his speechwriter and special assistant [[Arthur M.

More to the point, Illinois was the site of the most extensive challenge process, which fell short, despite repeated efforts spearheaded by Cook County state's attorney Benjamin Adamowski, a Republican, who also lost his re-election bid. Despite demonstrating net errors favoring both Nixon and Adamowski (some precincts, 40% in Nixon's case, showed errors favoring them, a factor suggesting error, rather than fraud), the totals found fell short of reversing the results for the candidates. While a Daley-connected circuit judge, Thomas Kluczynski (later appointed a federal judge by Kennedy, at Daley's recommendation), threw out a federal lawsuit \"filed to contend\" the voting totals,<ref name=\"wash post\"/> the Republican-dominated State Board of Elections unanimously rejected the challenge to the results. Furthermore, there were signs of possible irregularities in downstate areas controlled by Republicans, which Democrats never seriously pressed, since the Republican challenges went nowhere.<ref>''Slate'', October 16, 2000, [http://www.slate.com/id/91350/ \"Was Nixon Robbed?

It found that while there was a pattern of miscounting votes to the advantage of Democratic candidates, Nixon suffered less from this than Republicans in other races, and, furthermore, the extrapolated error would only have reduced his Illinois margin from 8,858 votes (the final official total) to just under 8,000. It concluded there was insufficient evidence that he had been cheated out of winning Illinois.\n\nA special prosecutor assigned to the case brought charges against 650 people, but charges were later dropped.<ref name=\"wash post\"/> Three Chicago election workers were convicted of voter fraud in 1962, and served short terms in jail.<ref name=\"wash post\"/> Mazo later said that he \"found names of the dead who had voted in Chicago, along with 56 people from one house\".<ref name=\"wash post\"/> He also found cases of Republican voter fraud in southern Illinois, but said that the totals \"did not match the Chicago fraud he found.\"<ref name=\"wash post\"/> After Mazo had published four parts of an intended 12-part voter fraud series documenting his findings, which was re-published nationally, he said: \"Nixon requested his publisher stop the rest of the series so as to prevent a [[constitutional crisis]].\"<ref name=\"wash post\"/> Nevertheless, the ''Chicago Tribune'' (which routinely endorsed GOP presidential candidates, including Nixon in 1960, 1968, and 1972) wrote that \"the election of November 8 was characterized by such gross and palpable fraud as to justify the conclusion that [Nixon] was deprived of victory\".<ref name=\"wash post\"/>\n\nNixon's personal decision not to challenge the electoral results came despite pressure from Eisenhower, his wife [[Pat Nixon|Pat]], and others. He explained in his memoirs that he did not do it for a number of reasons, one of them being that every state had different electoral laws, and some had no provisions for a vote recount. Consequently, a recount of the votes, if it was even possible, would take months, during which time the nation would be left without a president. Furthermore, Nixon feared that it would set a bad precedent for other countries, especially the Latin American states (\"every pipsqueak politician down there would start claiming fraud when he lost an election\"). \"I had no doubt that had the results been the other way around, Kennedy wouldn't have hesitated to challenge the election.\"\n\n=== Popular votes ===\n\n==== Alabama ====\n{{See also|1960 United States presidential election in Alabama|United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote#1960 Alabama results ambiguity}}\n\nThe situation in Alabama was controversial, as the number of popular votes that Kennedy received in Alabama is difficult to determine because of the unusual situation there. Instead of having the voters use one vote to choose from a slate of electors, the Alabama ballot had voters choose the [[US Presidential Electors|electors]] individually with up to 11 votes. In such a situation, a given candidate is traditionally assigned the popular vote of the elector who received the most votes. For instance, all 11 Republican candidates in Alabama were pledged to Nixon, and the 11 Republican electors received anywhere from as low as 230,951 votes (for George Witcher) to as high as 237,981 votes (for Cecil Durham); Nixon is therefore assigned 237,981 popular votes from Alabama.\n\nThe situation was more complicated on the Democratic side. The Alabama statewide Democratic primary had chosen 11 candidates for the Electoral College, five of whom were pledged to vote for Kennedy, but the other six of whom were unpledged and could therefore vote for anyone that they chose to be president. All 11 of these Democratic candidates won in the general election in Alabama, from as low as 316,394 votes for Karl Harrison, to as high as 324,050 votes for [[Frank M. Dixon]]. All six of the unpledged Democratic electors ended up voting against Kennedy, and instead voted for the Dixiecrat segregationist [[Harry F. Byrd]]. The number of popular votes that Kennedy received is therefore difficult to calculate. There are typically three methods that can be used. The first method, which is mostly used and the method used on the results table on this page below, is to assign Kennedy 318,303 votes in Alabama (the votes won by the most popular Kennedy elector, C.G. Allen), and to assign 324,050 votes in Alabama (the votes won by the most popular unpledged Democratic elector, Frank M. Dixon) to unpledged electors. However, using this method gives a combined voting total that is much higher than the actual number of votes cast for the Democrats in Alabama. The second method that can be used is to give Kennedy 318,303 votes in Alabama, and count the remaining 5,747 Democratic votes as unpledged electors. \n\nThe third method would give a completely different outlook in terms of the popular vote in both Alabama and in the USA overall. The third method is to allocate the Democratic votes in Alabama between Kennedy electors and unpledged electors on a percentage basis, giving 5/11s of the 324,050 Democratic votes to Kennedy (which comes to 147,295 votes for Kennedy) and 6/11s of the 324,050 Democratic votes to unpledged electors (which comes to 176,755 votes for unpledged electors). Bearing in mind that the highest Republican/Nixon elector in Alabama got 237,981 votes, this third method of calculating the Alabama vote means that Nixon wins the popular vote in Alabama, and wins the popular vote in the USA overall, as it would give Kennedy 34,049,976 votes nationally, and Nixon 34,108,157 votes nationally.<ref name=\"trende\">{{cite news| title = Did JFK Lose the Popular Vote?| publisher = RealClearPolitics| date = October 22, 2012| url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/10/19/did_jfk_lose_the_popular_vote_115833.html| access-date = October 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==== Georgia ====\n{{see also|1960 United States presidential election in Georgia}}\nThe number of popular votes Kennedy and Nixon received in Georgia is also difficult to determine because voters voted for 12 separate electors.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Novotny|first1=Patrick|title=John F.

The average vote totals for the 12 electors were 455,629 for the Democratic electors, and 273,110 for the Republican electors.

The Democrats in Alabama put up a mixed slate of five electors loyal to Kennedy and six unpledged electors. The Democrats in Mississippi put up two distinct slates – one of Kennedy loyalists, and one of unpledged electors. Louisiana also put up two distinct slates, although the unpledged slate did not receive the \"Democratic\" label. Georgia freed its Democratic electors from pledges to vote for Kennedy, although all 12 Democratic electors in Georgia did end up voting for Kennedy. Governor [[Ernest Vandiver]] wanted the Democratic electors to vote against Kennedy. Former governor Ellis Arnall supported Kennedy getting the electoral votes, with Arnall calling Vandiver's stand \"utterly disgraceful\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Novotny|first=Patrick|date=Fall 2004|title=John F.

Because electors pledged to Kennedy had won a clear majority of the Electoral College, the unpledged electors could not influence the results. Nonetheless, they refused to vote for Kennedy. Instead, they voted for Byrd, even though he was not an announced candidate and did not seek their votes. In addition, Byrd received one electoral vote from a faithless Republican elector in Oklahoma, for a total of 15 electoral votes. The faithless Republican elector in Oklahoma voted for [[Barry Goldwater]] as vice president; whereas the 14 unpledged Democratic electors from Mississippi and Alabama voted for [[Strom Thurmond]] as vice president.\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name= [[John F.

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ticket of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] defeated incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|president]] [[Jimmy Carter]] and incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] [[Walter Mondale]] in a [[landslide victory]].\n\nCarter's unpopularity and poor relations with Democratic leaders encouraged an unsuccessful [[1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries|intra-party]] challenge by United States senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. Meanwhile, [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|the Republican primaries]] were contested between former California governor Reagan, former Central Intelligence Agency director [[George H. W. Bush]], U.S. Representative [[John B. Anderson]], and several other candidates. All of Reagan's opponents had dropped out by the end of the primaries, and the Republicans nominated a ticket consisting of Reagan and Bush. Anderson entered the general election as [[Independent (politician)|an independent]] candidate, with former Wisconsin governor [[Patrick Lucey]] as his running mate.\n\nReagan campaigned for increased defense spending, [[supply-side economic]] policies, and a balanced budget. His campaign was aided by Democratic dissatisfaction with Carter, the [[Iran hostage crisis]], and a worsening economy marked by [[stagflation]]. Carter attacked Reagan as a dangerous right-wing extremist, and warned that Reagan would cut [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].\n\nReagan won the election by a landslide, taking 489 votes in [[Electoral College (United States)|the Electoral College]] and 50.7% of the popular vote to Carter's 41.0%. Carter carried just six states and Washington, D.C. Anderson won 6.6% of the popular vote. Due to the rise of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] following Reagan's victory, historians have considered the election a [[political realignment]] that began with [[Barry Goldwater]]'s presidential campaign [[1964 United States presidential election|in 1964]]. As of 2023, this remains the most recent election in which an incumbent Democratic president was not reelected.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Perlstein|first=Richard|title=Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus|publisher=Nation Books|year=2001|isbn=978-1-56858-412-6|location=New York|pages=x}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Foreign policy of the Jimmy Carter administration}}\nThroughout the 1970s, the United States underwent a wrenching period of [[stagflation|low economic growth, high inflation and interest rates]], and [[1970s energy crisis|intermittent energy crises]].<ref name=\"'70s 292\">{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last=Frum|first=David|author-link=David Frum|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-465-04195-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/292 292]|url=https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/292}}</ref> By October 1978, [[Pahlavi Iran|Iran]]—a major oil supplier to the United States at the time—was experiencing a [[Iranian revolution|major uprising]] that severely damaged its oil infrastructure and greatly weakened its capability to produce oil.<ref name=uppafb>{{cite magazine |title=Oil Squeeze |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946222,00.html |magazine=Time |date=1979-02-05 |access-date=December 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307085655/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946222,00.html |archive-date=7 March 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In January 1979, shortly after Iran's leader [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] fled the country, Iranian opposition figure [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] ended his 14-year exile in France and returned to Iran to establish an [[Iran|Islamic Republic]], largely hostile to American interests and influence in the country.<ref name=uppafb /> In the spring and summer of 1979, inflation was on the rise and various parts of the United States were experiencing energy shortages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/money/retirement-planning/inflation-proofing-6-07/overview/0607_inflation_proofing_ov.htm |title=Inflation-proofing |publisher=ConsumerReports.org |date=2010-02-11 |access-date=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nCarter was widely blamed for the return of the long gas lines in the summer of 1979 that were last seen just after the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]].

Carter left for the presidential retreat of [[Camp David]]. \"For more than a week, a veil of secrecy enveloped the proceedings.

Carter's calm approach towards the handling of this crisis resulted in his approval ratings jump in the 60-percent range in some polls, due to a \"rally round the flag\" effect.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=174181|title=Foreign Policy and Presidential Popularity: Creating Windows of Opportunity in the Perpetual Election|first1=Robin F.|last1=Marra|first2=Charles W.|last2=Ostrom|first3=Dennis M.|last3=Simon|date=1 January 1990|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=34|issue=4|pages=588–623|doi=10.1177/0022002790034004002|s2cid=154620443}}</ref>\n\nBy the beginning of the election campaign, the prolonged [[Iran hostage crisis]] had sharpened public perceptions of a national crisis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/19/iran/main265499.shtml |title=CBS News &#124; Reagan's Lucky Day &#124; January 21, 2001 14:03:21 |website=www.cbsnews.com |access-date=17 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021016003953/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/19/iran/main265499.shtml |archive-date=16 October 2002 |url-status=dead}}</ref> On April 25, 1980, Carter's ability to use the hostage crisis to regain public acceptance eroded when his high risk [[Operation Eagle Claw|attempt to rescue the hostages]] ended in disaster when eight servicemen were killed.

Carter's critics saw him as an inept leader who had failed to solve the worsening economic problems at home.

Furthermore, Carter began secret support of the opposition forces in Afghanistan that successfully tied down the Soviet army for a decade.

Brown withdrew on April 2. Carter and Kennedy faced off in 34 primaries. Not counting the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]] in which [[Lyndon Johnson]] withdrew his candidacy, this was the most tumultuous [[Primary election#In the United States|primary race]] that an elected incumbent president had encountered since [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]], during the highly contentious [[1912 United States presidential election|election of 1912]].\n\nDuring the summer of 1980, there was a short-lived \"Draft Muskie\" movement; Secretary of State [[Edmund Muskie]] was seen as a favorable alternative to a deadlocked convention. One poll showed that Muskie would be a more popular alternative to Carter than Kennedy, implying that the attraction was not so much to Kennedy as to the fact that he was not Carter.

Carter steadfastly refused to participate in a debate if Anderson was included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. A League-sponsored debate was held on September 21, 1980, in the [[Baltimore Convention Center]]. Of Carter's refusal to debate, Reagan said: \"He [Carter] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by [[Jody Powell]]\".<ref name=\"Reagan on Carter in Baltimore 478\">{{cite book |title=Rendezvous with Destiny: Ronald Reagan and the Campaign That Changed America|last=Shirley|first=Craig|author-link=Craig Shirley|year=2009|publisher=ISI Books|location=Wilmington, Delaware|isbn=978-1-933859-55-2|page=478}}</ref> Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch Reagan, managed only a narrow win, according to many in the media at that time, with Reagan putting up a much stronger performance than expected. Despite the narrow win in the debate, Anderson, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and at the time of the debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan enough on their social issue differences and on Reagan's advocation of supply-side economics. Instead, Anderson started off by criticizing Carter: \"Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend,\" to which Reagan added: \"It's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement.\"<ref name=\"Reagan Anderson Debate 479\">{{cite book |title=Rendezvous with Destiny: Ronald Reagan and the Campaign That Changed America|last=Shirley|first=Craig|author-link=Craig Shirley|year=2009|publisher=ISI Books|location=Wilmington, Delaware |isbn=978-1-933859-55-2 |page=479}}</ref> In one moment in the debate, Reagan commented on a rumor that Anderson had invited Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] to be his running mate by asking the candidate directly, \"John, would you really prefer Teddy Kennedy to me?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/fred-barnes/ |title=Fred Barnes on Conversations with Bill Kristol |website=Conversationswithbillkristol.org |access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n\nAs September turned into October, the situation remained essentially the same. Reagan insisted Anderson be allowed to participate in a three-way debate, while Carter remained steadfastly opposed to this. As the standoff continued, the second debate was canceled, as was the vice presidential debate.\n\n[[File:Carter Reagan Debate 10-28-80.png|thumb|President Carter ''(left)'' and former Governor Reagan ''(right)'' at the presidential debate on October 28, 1980]]\nWith two weeks to go to the election, the Reagan campaign decided at that point that the best thing to do was to accede to all of President Carter's demands. The final debate, featuring only Carter and Reagan, was rescheduled for October 28 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. The showdown ranked among the highest ratings of any [[television]] program in the previous decade. Debate topics included the Iranian hostage crisis and nuclear arms.

This did not occur again for either party until 2020.\n\nReagan won 53% of the vote in reliably Democratic [[South Boston]], one example of the so-called [[Reagan Democrat]].<ref name=\"'70s 283\"/> Although he won an even larger Electoral College majority in 1984, the 1980 election nonetheless stands as the last time some now very strongly Democratic counties gave a Republican a majority or plurality. Notable examples are [[Jefferson County, Washington|Jefferson County]] in Washington State, [[Lane County, Oregon]], [[Marin County, California|Marin]] and [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz Counties]] in California, [[McKinley County, New Mexico]], and [[Rock Island County, Illinois]].<ref>Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century 'How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century']; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref> Survey research and post-election polling indicated that the landslide result had been more a repudiation of Carter than an embrace of Reagan. But the public was aware that Reagan would move the nation in a more conservative direction, and was apparently willing to give it a chance to avoid four more years of Carter.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brauer |first1=Carl M. |title=Presidential Transitions: Eisenhower Through Reagan |date=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0195040511 |page=220}}</ref>\n\nAt age 69, Reagan was the oldest non-incumbent to win a presidential election.

For a typical phone call, the audio sound is digitized at an 8 [[kHz]] sample rate, or 8000 samples per second, using 8-bit [[pulse-code modulation]] for each of the samples.  This results in a data rate of 64 [[kbit/s]].\n\nBecause of its fundamental role in carrying a single phone call, the DS0 rate forms the basis for the digital multiplex [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] hierarchy in telecommunications systems used in North America.  To limit the number of wires required between two involved in exchanging voice calls, a system was built in which multiple DS0s are [[multiplexed]] together on higher capacity circuits.  In this system, twenty-four (24) DS0s are multiplexed into a  [[Digital Signal 1|DS1]] signal.  Twenty-eight (28) DS1s are multiplexed into a [[Digital Signal 3|DS3]].  When carried over copper wire, this is the well-known [[T-carrier]] system, with [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] and [[Digital Signal 3|T3]] corresponding to DS1 and DS3, respectively.     \n\nBesides its use for voice communications, the DS0 rate may support twenty 2.4 kbit/s channels, ten 4.8 kbit/s channels, five 9.67 kbit/s channels, one 56 kbit/s channel, or one 64 kbit/s clear channel.\n\nE0 (standardized as [[G.703|ITU G.703]]) is the European equivalent of the North American DS0 for carrying  a single voice call.  However, there are some subtle differences in implementation.  Voice signals are encoded for carriage over E0 according to [[G.711|ITU G.711]].  Note that when a T-carrier system is used as in North America, [[robbed bit signaling]] can mean that a DS0 channel carried over that system is not an error-free bit-stream. The [[out-of-band signaling]] used in the European E-carrier system avoids this.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[DS0A]]\n*[[Digital Signal 1]]\n*[[Digital Signal 3]]\n\n{{FS1037C}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications standards]]","_bytes":2957,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2021-01-20T21:49:29Z"},"title":"Digital Signal 0","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}
