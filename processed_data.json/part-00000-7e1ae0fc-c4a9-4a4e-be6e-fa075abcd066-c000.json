Public entities must comply with Title II regulations by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. These regulations cover access to all programs and services offered by the entity. Access includes physical access described in the ADA Standards for Accessible Design and programmatic access that might be obstructed by discriminatory policies or procedures of the entity.\n\nTitle II applies to public transportation provided by public entities through regulations by the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]]. It includes the [[Amtrak|National Railroad Passenger Corporation]] (Amtrak), along with all other commuter authorities. This section requires the provision of paratransit services by public entities that provide fixed-route services. ADA also sets minimum requirements for space layout in order to facilitate wheelchair securement on public transport.<ref>'Wheelchair Securement in Public Transport', http://thequantumleap.com/faq/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302015706/http://thequantumleap.com/faq/ |date=March 2, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nTitle II also applies to all state and local public housing, housing assistance, and housing referrals. The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] is charged with enforcing this provision.\n\n{{anchor|Title III}}\n\n===Title III—public accommodations (and commercial facilities)===\n{{Hatnote|See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12181|12189}}.}}\n[[File: Drano Lake accessible fishing platform signage.jpg|thumb|The ADA sets standards for construction of accessible public facilities. Shown is a sign indicating an accessible fishing platform at [[Drano Lake]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].]]\n\nUnder Title III, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal [[enjoyment]] of the goods, services, facilities, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation. Public accommodations include most places of lodging (such as inns and hotels), recreation, transportation, education, and dining, along with stores, care providers, and places of public displays.\n\nUnder Title III of the ADA, all new construction (construction, modification or alterations) after the effective date of the ADA (approximately July 1992) must be fully compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG)<ref name=ada90/> found in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] at 28&nbsp;C.F.R., Part 36, Appendix ''A''.\n\nTitle III also has applications to existing facilities. One of the definitions of \"discrimination\" under Title III of the ADA is a \"failure to remove\" architectural barriers in existing facilities. See {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|42|12182|b|2|A|iv}}. This means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the ADA was passed still have obligations. The standard is whether \"removing barriers\" (typically defined as bringing a condition into compliance with the ADAAG) is \"readily achievable\", defined as \"...easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense\".\n\nThe statutory definition of \"readily achievable\" calls for a [[balancing test]] between the cost of the proposed \"fix\" and the wherewithal of the business and/or owners of the business. Thus, what might be \"readily achievable\" for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business.\n\nThere are exceptions to this title; many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by Title III. With regard to historic properties (those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]], or properties designated as historic under state or local law), those facilities must still comply with the provisions of Title III of the ADA to the \"maximum extent feasible\" but if following the usual standards would \"threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building\" then alternative standards may be used.\n\nUnder 2010 revisions of Department of Justice regulations, newly constructed or altered swimming pools, wading pools, and spas must have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for disabled people. However, the requirement is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is \"readily achievable\". Other requirements exist, based on pool size, include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit, which are outlined in Section 242 of the standards. However, businesses are free to consider the differences in the application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered, or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule. Full compliance may not be required for existing facilities; Section 242 and 1009 of the 2010 Standards outline such exceptions.<ref>{{cite web |title=2013 ADA Pool Lift Compliance Deadline: Has Your Business Complied? |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/2013-ada-pool-lift-compliance-deadline-has-your-business-complied |work=The National Law Review |publisher=Lowndes, Drosdick, Doster, Kantor & Reed, P.A. |date=January 29, 2013 |access-date=February 19, 2013 |archive-date=December 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217070851/http://www.natlawreview.com/article/2013-ada-pool-lift-compliance-deadline-has-your-business-complied |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==== Service animals ====\nThe ADA provides explicit coverage for [[service animal]]s.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm | title=ADA 2010 Revised Requirements: Service Animals | date=July 12, 2011 | publisher=US Department of Justice | access-date=July 2, 2019 | archive-date=July 11, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711125702/http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html|title=Americans with Disabilities Act Questions and Answers: Service Animals|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=May 10, 2016|archive-date=May 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510094055/http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Guidelines have been developed not only to protect persons with disabilities but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, but they are not allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They cannot ask what the person's disabilities are. A person with a disability cannot be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner cannot get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animals would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety, so it would not be a valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premises. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals, nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal to relieve itself. Lastly, people that require service dogs cannot be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly, for example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities cannot be treated as \"less than\" other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for their service animal's damages to the property.\n\n{{anchor|Auxiliary aid}}\n\n==== Auxiliary aids ====\n{{redirect|Auxiliary aid|the concept of auxiliary aid in United Kingdom law|United Kingdom employment equality law#Disability claims}}\nThe ADA provides explicit coverage for auxiliary aids.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ada.gov/reachingout/t3regl2.html | title=Sec. 36.303 Auxiliary aids and services. | date=June 13, 2020 | publisher=US Department of Justice | access-date=June 13, 2020 | archive-date=June 9, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609225746/https://www.ada.gov/reachingout/t3regl2.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAuxiliary aids and services are items, equipment or services that assist in effective communication between a person who has a hearing, vision or speech disability and a person who does not.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What are auxiliary aids and services? {{!}} www.adalive.org|url=https://www.adalive.org/faq_episode4_q4|access-date=June 13, 2020|website=www.adalive.org|archive-date=June 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609225823/https://www.adalive.org/faq_episode4_q4|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nADA says that a public accommodation shall take those steps that may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services, unless the public accommodation can demonstrate that taking those steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being offered or would result in an undue burden, i.e., significant difficulty or expense. The term \"auxiliary aids and services\" includes:\n\n# Qualified interpreters on-site or through [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI) services; notetakers; real-time computer-aided transcription services; written materials; exchange of written notes; telephone handset amplifiers; assistive listening devices; assistive listening systems; telephones compatible with hearing aids; [[Closed captioning|closed caption]] decoders; open and closed captioning, including real-time captioning; voice, text, and video-based telecommunications products and systems, including text telephones (TTYs), videophones, and captioned telephones, or equally effective telecommunications devices; videotext displays; accessible electronic and information technology; or other effective methods of making aurally delivered information available to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing;\n# Qualified readers; taped texts; audio recordings; Brailled materials and displays; screen reader software; magnification software; optical readers; secondary auditory programs (SAP); large print materials; accessible electronic and information technology; or other effective methods of making visually delivered materials available to individuals who are blind or have low vision;\n# Acquisition or modification of equipment or devices; and\n# Other similar services and actions.\n\nCaptions are considered one type of auxiliary aid. Since the passage of the ADA, the use of captioning has expanded. Entertainment, educational, informational, and training materials are captioned for deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences at the time they are produced and distributed. The '''Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990''' requires that all televisions larger than 13 inches sold in the United States after July 1993 have a special built-in decoder that enables viewers to watch closed-captioned programming. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to adopt rules requiring closed captioning of most television programming. The FCC's rules on closed captioning became effective January 1, 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 18, 2015|title=Captions For Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Viewers|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/captions-deaf-and-hard-hearing-viewers|access-date=June 13, 2020|website=NIDCD|language=en|archive-date=June 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613183901/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/captions-deaf-and-hard-hearing-viewers|url-status=live}} {{include-USGov|agency=NIDCD}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Title IV}}\n\n===Title IV—telecommunications===\nTitle IV of the ADA amended the landmark [[Communications Act of 1934]] primarily by adding section {{UnitedStatesCode|47|225}}. This section requires that all telecommunications companies in the U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments. When Title IV took effect in the early 1990s, it led to the installation of public [[teletypewriter]] (TTY) machines and other TDD ([[Telecommunications Device for the Deaf|telecommunications devices for the deaf]]). Title IV also led to the creation, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, of what was then called dual-party relay services and now are known as [[Telecommunications Relay Services]] (TRS), such as [[STS relay]]. Today, many TRS-mediated calls are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are [[Video Relay Service]] (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. In either variation, communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.\n\n{{anchor|Title V}}\n\n===Title V—miscellaneous provisions===\n{{Hatnote|See {{UnitedStatesCode|42|12201|12213}}.}}\n\nTitle V includes technical provisions.

Among the disincentives to independence the Council identified was the existence of large remaining gaps in civil rights coverage for people with disabilities in the United States.

The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) was charged with interpreting the 1990 law with regard to discrimination in employment. The EEOC developed regulations limiting an individual's impairment to one that \"severely or significantly restricts\" a major life activity. The ADAAA directed the EEOC to amend its regulations and replace \"severely or significantly\" with \"substantially limits\", a more lenient standard.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet on the EEOC's Final Regulations Implementing the ADAAA |url=http://www1.eeoc.gov//laws/regulations/adaaa_fact_sheet.cfm?renderforprint=1 |website=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |access-date=September 4, 2015 |archive-date=September 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906192239/http://www1.eeoc.gov//laws/regulations/adaaa_fact_sheet.cfm?renderforprint=1 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn September 25, 2008, President [[George W.

It also overturned the court restriction that an impairment that substantially limits one major life activity must also limit others to be considered a disability.<ref name=BLR />\nIn 2008, the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor]] stated that the amendment \"makes it absolutely clear that the ADA is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=United States of America Congressional Record Proceedings and Debates of the 110th Congress Second Session Volume 154-Part 10 |date=2008 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.

The two plaintiffs, [[Lois Curtis]] and E.W., were institutionalized in Georgia for diagnosed \"mental retardation\" and schizophrenia.

The plaintiffs sued the state of Georgia and the institution for being inappropriately treated and housed in the institutional setting rather than being treated in one of the state's community-based treatment facilities.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided under Title II of the ADA that mental illness is a form of disability and therefore covered under the ADA, and that unjustified institutional isolation of a person with a disability is a form of discrimination because it \"...perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.\" The court added, \"Confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.\"\n\nTherefore, under Title II no person with a disability can be unjustly excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs or activities of any public entity.<ref name=Olmstead/>\n\n===''Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America v.

Williams]]'',<ref name=Toyota>{{ussc|name=Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams|link=|volume=534|page=184|pin=|year=2002}}.</ref> was a case in which the Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the phrase \"substantially impairs\" as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act. It reversed a Sixth Court of Appeals decision to grant a partial [[summary judgment]] in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams, that qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. The Court held that the \"major life activity\" definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living. The issue is not whether Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks, which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that Williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores, such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found that Williams was disabled.<ref name=Toyota/><ref name=\"workerrights\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGRFPMUFUSkC&q=TOYOTA+of+KY+v+Ella+WILLIAMS&pg=PA70 |title=Workers' Rights |access-date=October 7, 2009 |last=Worth |first=Richard |isbn=978-0-7614-2574-8 |date=November 15, 2007 |archive-date=October 20, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211020101951/https://books.google.com/books?id=GGRFPMUFUSkC&q=TOYOTA+of+KY+v+Ella+WILLIAMS&pg=PA70 |url-status=live }}</ref> This ruling has since been invalidated by the ADAAA.
