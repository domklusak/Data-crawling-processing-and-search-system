The P-40 design was a modification of the previous [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk]] which reduced development time and enabled a rapid entry into production and operational service. The Warhawk was used by most [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] during World War II, and remained in frontline service until the end of the war. It was the third most-produced American fighter of World War II, after the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]] and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]]; by November 1944, when production of the P-40 ceased, 13,738 had been built,<ref name=Murphy>Murphy and McNiece 2009, p. 83.</ref> all at [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation]]'s main production facilities in [[Buffalo, New York]].\n\nP-40 Warhawk was the name the [[United States Army Air Corps]] gave the plane, and after June 1941, the [[USAAF]]\nadopted the name for all models, making it the official name in the U.S. for all P-40s. The [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] air forces used the name '''Tomahawk''' for models equivalent to the original P-40, P-40B, and P-40C, and the name '''Kittyhawk''' for models equivalent to the P-40D and all later variants. P-40s first saw combat with the British Commonwealth squadrons of the [[Desert Air Force]] in the Middle East and North African campaigns, during June 1941.<ref name = \"nijbrw\">Alexander 2006, p. 25.</ref><ref name = \"lmnsbs\">Brown 1983, p. 20.</ref> [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|No. 112 Squadron]] [[Royal Air Force]], was among the first to operate Tomahawks in North Africa and the unit was the first [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] military aviation unit to feature the \"shark mouth\" logo,<ref name=Crawford>Crawford 1977, p. 14.</ref><ref>Vader 1970, p. 95.</ref> copying [[ZG 76|similar markings]] on some Luftwaffe [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] twin-engine fighters.<ref name=Crawford/> {{refn|Inspired by 112 Squadron's usage of them in North Africa, and by the Luftwaffe's earlier use of it, both via Allied wartime newspaper and magazine article images, [[Nose art|the \"shark mouth\" logo]] on the sides of the P-40's nose was most famously used on those of the [[Flying Tigers]] in China. The Bf 110s were from ''II Gruppe/[[Zerstörergeschwader 76]]''. Shilling, an AVG pilot indicated, \"I was looking through a British magazine one day and saw a photo of a Messerschmitt-110 with a shark face on it.\"<ref>[http://www.warbirdforum.com/erikrip.htm Erik Shilling–; ''Off on his Last Flight''.] Retrieved: 28 February 2008.</ref>|group=N}}\n \nThe P-40's liquid-cooled, supercharged [[Allison V-1710]] [[V12 engine|V-12]] engine's lack of a [[supercharger|two-speed supercharger]] made it inferior to [[Luftwaffe]] fighters such as the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] or the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] in high-altitude combat and it was rarely used in operations in [[Western Front (World War II)|Northwest Europe]]. However, between 1941 and 1944, the P-40 played a critical role with Allied air forces in three major theaters: [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]], and [[Second Sino-Japanese War|China]]. It also had a significant role in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre|Middle East]], [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|Southeast Asia]], [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Europe]], [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Alaska]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. The P-40's performance at high altitudes was not as important in those theaters, where it served as an [[air superiority fighter]], bomber escort and [[fighter-bomber]].\n\nAlthough it gained a postwar reputation as a mediocre design, suitable only for [[close air support]], more recent research including scrutiny of the records of Allied squadrons indicates that this was not the case; the P-40 performed surprisingly well as an air superiority fighter, at times suffering severe losses, but also inflicting a very heavy toll on enemy aircraft.<ref name=\"P40Zero\">Masell, Patrick.

The first Tomahawks delivered came without armor, bulletproof windscreens or [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s, which were installed in subsequent shipments. Pilots used to British fighters sometimes found it difficult to adapt to the P-40's rear-folding landing gear, which was more prone to collapse than the lateral-folding landing gear of the Hurricane or [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. In contrast to the \"three-point landing\" commonly employed with British types, P-40 pilots were obliged to use a \"wheels landing\": a longer, low angle approach that touched down on the main wheels first.\n\nTesting showed the aircraft did not have the performance needed for use in [[North-West Europe|Northwest Europe]] at high-altitude, due to the service ceiling limitation. Spitfires used in the theater operated at heights around {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, while the P-40's Allison engine, with its single-stage, low altitude rated supercharger, worked best at {{convert|15000|ft|m|abbr=on}} or lower.

Chennault considered the liquid-cooled engine vulnerable in combat because a single bullet through the coolant system would cause the engine to overheat in minutes. The Tomahawks also had no radios, so the AVG improvised by installing a fragile radio transceiver, the RCA-7-H, which had been built for a Piper Cub. Because the plane had a single-stage low-altitude supercharger,<ref>02-5AD-1 V-1710-35 Operating and Flight Instructions dated 1941-10-25</ref> its effective ceiling was about {{convert|25000|ft|m}}. The most critical problem was the lack of spare parts; the only source was from damaged aircraft. The planes were viewed as cast-offs that no one else wanted, dangerous and difficult to fly. But the pilots did appreciate some of the planes' features. There were two heavy sheets of steel behind the pilot's head and back that offered solid protection, and overall the planes were ruggedly constructed.<ref>Schultz, Duane. 1987. ''The Maverick War, Chennault and the Flying Tigers''. St. Martin's Press, 335 pp.</ref>\n\nCompared to opposing Japanese fighters, the P-40B's strengths were that it was sturdy, well armed, faster in a dive and possessed an excellent rate of roll. While the P-40s could not match the maneuverability of the Japanese Army air arm's [[Nakajima Ki-27]]s and [[Nakajima Ki-43|Ki-43s]], nor the much more famous [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zero naval fighter]] in slow, turning dogfights, at higher speeds the P-40s were more than a match.

The AVG was highly successful, and its feats were widely publicized by an active cadre of international journalists to boost sagging public morale at home. According to its official records, in just {{frac|6|1|2}} months, the Flying Tigers destroyed 297 enemy aircraft for the loss of just four of its own in air-to-air combat.\n\nIn the spring of 1942, the AVG received a small number of Model E's. Each came equipped with a radio, six .50-caliber machine guns, and auxiliary bomb racks that could hold 35-lb fragmentation bombs. Chennault's armorer added bomb racks for 570-lb Russian bombs, which the Chinese had in abundance. These planes were used in the battle of the [[Salween River]] Gorge in late May 1942, which kept the Japanese from entering China from Burma and threatening Kunming. Spare parts, however, remained in short supply. \"Scores of new planes...were now in India, and there they stayed—in case the Japanese decided to invade... the AVG was lucky to get a few tires and spark plugs with which to carry on its daily war.\"<ref>Schultz, Duane. 1987.</ref>\n\n====4th Air Group====\nChina received 27 P-40E models in early 1943.

Robert DeHaven describes how this tactic was used in the 49th Fighter group:\n:[Y]ou could fight a Jap on even terms, but you had to make him fight your way. He could outturn you at slow speed. You could outturn him at high speed. When you got into a turning fight with him, you dropped your nose down so you kept your airspeed up, you could outturn him. At low speed he could outroll you because of those big ailerons ... on the Zero. If your speed was up over 275, you could outroll [a Zero]. His big ailerons didn't have the strength to make high speed rolls... You could push things, too. Because ... [i]f you decided to go home, you could go home. He couldn't because you could outrun him.

The P-40 remained in use in the [[China Burma India Theater]] (CBI) until 1944 and was reportedly preferred over the P-51 Mustang by some US pilots flying in China.

Spitfire production was being absorbed by the war in Europe; P-38s were trialled, but were difficult to obtain; Mustangs had not yet reached squadrons anywhere, and Australia's tiny and inexperienced aircraft industry was geared towards larger aircraft. USAAF P-40s and their pilots originally intended for the [[United States Far East Air Force|U.S. Far East Air Force]] in the Philippines, but diverted to Australia as a result of Japanese naval activity were the first suitable fighter aircraft to arrive in substantial numbers. By mid-1942, the RAAF was able to obtain some USAAF replacement shipments.\n\nRAAF Kittyhawks played a crucial role in the [[South West Pacific theater of World War II|South West Pacific theater]]. They fought on the front line as fighters during the critical early years of the Pacific War, and the durability and bomb-carrying abilities (1,000&nbsp;lb/454&nbsp;kg) of the P-40 also made it ideal for the ground attack role.

However, Kittyhawks were in use with the RAAF until the end of the war, in Borneo. In all, the RAAF acquired 841 Kittyhawks (not counting the British-ordered examples used in North Africa), including 163 P-40E, 42 P-40K, 90 P-40 M and 553 P-40N models.<ref>[http://www.defence.gov.au/RAAF/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A29.htm RAAF Museum, 2007, \"A29 Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk\".] ''defence.gov.au''.

While the Spitfire was considered to have performed better, it was not available for use in Canada and the P-40 was ordered to meet home air defense requirements. In all, eight Home War Establishment Squadrons were equipped with the Kittyhawk: 72 Kittyhawk I, 12 Kittyhawk Ia, 15 Kittyhawk III and 35 Kittyhawk IV aircraft, for a total of 134 aircraft. These aircraft were mostly diverted from RAF Lend-Lease orders for service in Canada. The P-40 Kittyhawks were obtained in lieu of 144 P-39 Airacobras originally allocated to Canada but reassigned to the RAF.\n\nHowever, before any home units received the P-40, three RCAF [[Article XV squadron]]s operated Tomahawk aircraft from bases in the United Kingdom. No. 403 Squadron RCAF, a fighter unit, used the Tomahawk Mk II briefly before converting to Spitfires. Two [[Close air support|Army Co-operation]] (close air support) squadrons: 400 and 414 Sqns trained with Tomahawks, before converting to Mustang Mk. I aircraft and a fighter/reconnaissance role. Of these, only No. 400 Squadron used Tomahawks operationally, conducting a number of armed sweeps over France in the late 1941. RCAF pilots also flew Tomahawks or Kittyhawks with other British Commonwealth units based in North Africa, the Mediterranean, South East Asia and (in at least one case) the South West Pacific.{{refn|After being evacuated from Singapore to Australia in 1942, F/L Thomas W.

RCAF home defense P-40 squadrons saw combat over the Aleutians, assisting the USAAF. The RCAF initially sent 111 Squadron, flying the Kittyhawk I, to the US base on [[Adak Airport|Adak]] island. During the drawn-out campaign, 12 Canadian Kittyhawks operated on a rotational basis from a new, more advanced base on [[Amchitka]],{{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Kiska]]. 14 and 111 Sqns took \"turn-about\" at the base. During a major attack on Japanese positions at Kiska on 25 September 1942, Squadron Leader [[Ken Boomer]] shot down a [[Nakajima A6M2-N]] (\"Rufe\") seaplane. The RCAF also purchased 12 P-40Ks directly from the USAAF while in the Aleutians. After the Japanese threat diminished, these two RCAF squadrons returned to Canada and eventually transferred to England without their Kittyhawks.\n\nIn January 1943, a further Article XV unit, 430 Squadron was formed at [[RAF Hartford Bridge]], England and trained on obsolete Tomahawk IIA.<ref>[http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/1w-1e/sqns-escs/page-eng.asp?id=394 Canadian Forces, \"430 Squadron – History\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807191815/http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/1w-1e/sqns-escs/page-eng.asp?id=394 |date=7 August 2011 }} ''airforce.forces.gc''.

The reports of pilots about the circumstances of the engagements confirm this fact. On 18 January 1942, Lieutenants S. V. Levin and I. P. Levsha (in pair) fought an engagement with seven Bf 109s and shot down two of them without loss. On 22 January, a flight of three aircraft led by Lieutenant E. E.

Altogether, in January, two Tomahawks were lost; one downed by German anti-aircraft artillery and one lost to Messerschmitts.<ref name=\"Romanenko\"/>\n\nThe Soviets stripped down their P-40s significantly for combat, in many cases removing the wing guns altogether in P-40B/C types, for example. Soviet Air Force reports state that they liked the range and fuel capacity of the P-40, which were superior to most of the Soviet fighters, though they still preferred the P-39. Soviet pilot Nikolai G. Golodnikov recalled: \"The cockpit was vast and high. At first it felt unpleasant to sit waist-high in glass, as the edge of the fuselage was almost at waist level. But the bullet-proof glass and armored seat were strong and visibility was good. The radio was also good. It was powerful, reliable, but only on HF (high frequency).

During the winter of 1941, the 126th Fighter Aviation Regiment suffered from cracked radiators on 38 occasions. Often, entire regiments were reduced to a single flyable aircraft because no replacement parts were available.<ref>Mellinger 2006, pp. 24–25</ref> They also had difficulty with the more demanding requirements for fuel and oil quality of the Allison engines.

It flew for the first time in October 1938.\nThis new liquid-cooled engine fighter had a radiator mounted under the rear fuselage\nbut the prototype XP-40 was later modified and the radiator was moved forward under the engine.\n;P-40\n:The P-40 (Curtiss Model 81A-1) was the first production variant, 199 built.\n;P-40A\n:One P-40 was modified with a camera installation in the rear fuselage and re-designated P-40A.\n*Revised versions of the P-40 soon followed: the '''P-40B''' or '''Tomahawk IIA''' had extra .30&nbsp;in (7.62&nbsp;mm) U.S., or [[.303 British|.303 in]] (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns in the wings and a partially protected fuel system; the '''P-40C''' or '''Tomahawk IIB''' added underbelly drop tank and bomb shackles, self-sealing fuel tanks and other minor revisions, but the extra weight did have a negative impact on aircraft performance. (All versions of the P-40 had a relatively low [[power-to-weight ratio]] compared to contemporary fighters.)\n*Only a small number of '''P-40D''' or '''Kittyhawk Mk I'''s were made, fewer than 50. With a new, larger Allison engine, slightly narrower fuselage, redesigned canopy, and improved cockpit, the P-40D eliminated the nose-mounted .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns and instead had a pair of .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns in each wing. The distinctive chin airscoop grew larger so they could adequately cool the large Allison engine.\n*Retrospective designation for a single prototype. The '''P-40A''' was a single camera-carrying aircraft.\n*The '''P-40E''' or '''P-40E-1''' was similar in most respects to the P-40D, except for a slightly more powerful engine and an extra .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) gun in each wing, bringing the total to six. Some aircraft also had small underwing bomb shackles. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IA'''. The P-40E was the variant that bore the brunt of air-to-air combat by the type in the key period of early to mid 1942, for example with the first US squadrons to replace the AVG in China (the AVG was already transitioning to this type from the P-40B/C), the type used by the Australians at Milne Bay, by the New Zealand squadrons during most of their air-to-air combat, and by the RAF/Commonwealth in North Africa as the Kittyhawk IA.\n\n[[File:P40F Merlin.JPG|thumb|The Fighter Collection's P-40F G-CGZP, showing Merlin 500 engine]]\n[[File:Curtiss P-40Fs near Moore AAF 1943.jpg|thumb|In the vicinity of [[Moore Field]], Texas. The lead ship in a formation of P-40s is peeling off for the \"attack\" in a practice flight at the US Army Air Forces advanced flying school. Selected aviation cadets were given transition training in these fighters before receiving their pilot's wings, 1943.]]\n\n*'''P-40F''' and '''P-40L''', which both featured [[Packard V-1650|Packard V-1650 Merlin]] engine in place of the normal Allison, and thus did not have the [[carburetor]] scoop on top of the nose. Performance for these models at higher altitudes was better than their Allison-engined cousins. The L in some cases also featured a fillet in front of the [[vertical stabilizer]], or a stretched fuselage to compensate for the higher torque. The P-40L was sometimes nicknamed \"[[Gypsy Rose Lee]]\", after a famous stripper of the era, due to its stripped-down condition. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces under the designation '''Kittyhawk Mk II''', a total of 330 Mk IIs were supplied to the RAF under Lend-Lease. The first 230 aircraft are sometimes known as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IIA'''. The P-40F/L was extensively used by U.S. fighter groups operating in the Mediterranean Theater.\n*'''P-40G''' : 43 P-40 aircraft fitted with the wings of the Tomahawk Mk IIA. A total of 16 aircraft were supplied to the Soviet Union, and the rest to the US Army Air Forces. It was later redesignated '''RP-40G'''.\n*'''P-40K''', an Allison-engined P-40L, with the nose-top scoop retained and the Allison-configured nose radiators scoop, cowl flaps and vertical-stabilizer-to-fuselage fillet. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk III''', it was widely used by US units in the CBI.\n*'''P-40M''', version generally similar to the P-40K, with a stretched fuselage like the P-40L and powered by an Allison V-1710-81 engine giving better performance at altitude (compared to previous Allison versions). It had some detail improvements and it was characterized by two small air scoops just before the exhaust pipes. Most of them were supplied to Allied countries (mainly UK and USSR), while some others remained in the US for advanced training. It was also supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk. III'''.\n*'''P-40N''' (manufactured 1943–44), the final production model. The P-40N featured a stretched rear fuselage to counter the torque of the more powerful, late-war Allison engine, and the rear deck of the cockpit behind the pilot was cut down at a moderate slant to improve rearward visibility. A great deal of work was also done to try and eliminate excess weight to improve the Warhawk's climb rate. Early N production blocks dropped a .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) gun from each wing, bringing the total back to four; later production blocks reintroduced it after complaints from units in the field. Supplied to Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IV'''. A total of 553 P-40Ns were acquired by the Royal Australian Air Force, making it the variant most commonly used by the RAAF. Subvariants of the P-40N ranged widely in specialization from stripped down four-gun \"hot rods\" that could reach the highest top speeds of any production variant of the P-40 (up to 380&nbsp;mph), to overweight types with all the extras intended for fighter-bombing or even training missions. The 15,000th P-40 was an N model decorated with the markings of 28 nations that had employed any of Curtiss-Wright's various aircraft products, not just P-40s. \"These spectacular markings gave rise to the erroneous belief that the P-40 series had been used by all 28 countries.\"<ref>McDowell 1968, p. 68.</ref> Since the P-40N was by 1944 used mainly as a ground attack aircraft in Europe, it was nicknamed '''B-40''' by pilots.<ref>Vader 1970, p. 137.</ref> Survivors redesignated as ZF-40N in June 1948.\n[[File:Curtiss P-40N.jpg|thumb|Curtiss P-40N Warhawk \"Little Jeanne\" in flight]]\n*'''P-40P''' : The designation of 1,500 aircraft ordered with V-1650-1 engines, but actually built as the P-40N with V-1710-81 engines.\n*'''XP-40Q''' : Three P-40N modified with a 4-bladed prop, cut-down rear fuselage and [[bubble canopy]], four guns, squared-off wingtips and tail surfaces, and improved engine with two-speed supercharger. Even with these changes, its performance was not enough of an improvement to merit production when compared to the contemporary late model '''P-47D'''s and '''P-51D'''s pouring off production lines. The XP-40Q was, however, the fastest of the P-40 series with a top speed of {{convert|422|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} as a result of the introduction of a high-altitude supercharger gear.

Capable of using unprepared [[runway]]s for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, [[Medical evacuation|medevac]], and [[Cargo aircraft|cargo transport aircraft]]. The versatile [[airframe]] has found uses in other roles, including as a [[gunship]] ([[AC-130]]), for [[airborne infantry|airborne assault]], [[search and rescue]], scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, [[aerial refueling]], [[maritime patrol]], and [[aerial firefighting]]. It is now the main [[tactical airlift]]er for many military forces worldwide. More than 40 variants of the Hercules, including civilian versions marketed as the [[Lockheed L-100]], operate in more than 60 nations.\n\nThe C-130 entered service with the U.S. in 1956, followed by Australia and many other nations. During its years of service, the Hercules has participated in numerous military, civilian and [[humanitarian aid]] operations. In 2007, the transport became the fifth aircraft{{refn|After the [[English Electric Canberra]], [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Tupolev Tu-95]], and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135 Stratotanker]].|group= N}} to mark 50 years of continuous service with its original primary customer, which for the C-130 is the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF). The C-130 is the longest continuously produced military aircraft at more than 60 years, with the updated [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules]] being produced {{as of|2023|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stokes |first=Stephannie |date=29 December 2015 |title=C-130 aircraft designed in the 1950s still delivers |url=http://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/29/business/c-130-aircraft-designed-1950s-still-delivers |work=[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]] |access-date=2 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102185645/http://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/29/business/c-130-aircraft-designed-1950s-still-delivers |archive-date=2 January 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Background and requirements===\nThe [[Korean War]] showed that [[World War II]]-era [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engine]] transports—[[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s, [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s and [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s—were no longer adequate. On 2 February 1951, the [[United States Air Force]] issued a General Operating Requirement (GOR) for a new transport to [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[Chase Aircraft]], [[North American Aviation|North American]], [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], and Airlifts Inc.\n\nThe new transport would have a capacity of 92 passengers, 72 combat troops or 64 [[paratroopers]] in a cargo compartment that was approximately {{cvt|41|ft}} long, {{cvt|9|ft}} high, and {{cvt|10|ft}} wide. Unlike transports derived from passenger airliners, it was to be designed specifically as a combat transport with loading from a hinged loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage. A notable advance for large aircraft was the introduction of a [[turboprop]] powerplant, the [[Allison T56]] which was developed for the C-130. It gave the aircraft greater range than a [[turbojet]] engine as it used less fuel.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |title=Today in History – April 21, 1964 – Military version of the C-130 finally takes flight |url=https://supersabresociety.com/this_time_in_history/today-in-history-april-21-1964-military-version-of-the-c-130-finally-takes-flight/ |access-date=2022-11-03 |website=Super Sabre Society |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite journal |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050019274 |website= Nasa.gov |title= An Investigation in the Ames 40- by 80-Foot Wind Tunnel of a YT-56A Turboprop Engine Incorporating a Decoupler and a Controlled-Feathering Device |date= 9 September 1954 |last1= Rogallo |first1= Vernon L. |last2= Yaggy |first2= Paul F. |last3= McCloud |first3= John L.}}</ref> Turboprop engines also produced much more power for their weight than piston engines. However, the turboprop configuration chosen for the T56, with the propeller connected to the compressor, had the potential to cause structural failure of the aircraft if an engine failed. Safety devices had to be incorporated to reduce the excessive drag from a windmilling propeller.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Design phase===\nThe Hercules resembles a larger, four-engine version of the [[Fairchild C-123 Provider]] with a similar wing and cargo ramp layout. The C-123 had evolved from the [[Chase XCG-20]] Avitruc first flown in 1950.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} The [[Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter]] had rear ramps, which made it possible to drive vehicles onto the airplane (also possible with the forward ramp on a [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|C-124]]). The ramp on the Hercules was also used to airdrop cargo, which included a [[Low-altitude parachute-extraction system]] for [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan tanks]] and even dropping large improvised \"[[BLU-82|daisy cutter]]\" bombs. The new Lockheed cargo plane had a range of {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} and it could operate from short and unprepared strips.\n\nFairchild, North American, Martin, and Northrop declined to participate. The remaining five companies tendered a total of ten designs: Lockheed two, Boeing one, Chase three, Douglas three, and Airlifts Inc. one. The contest was a close affair between the lighter of the two Lockheed (preliminary project designation L-206) proposals and a four-turboprop Douglas design.\n\nThe Lockheed design team was led by [[Willis Hawkins]], starting with a 130-page proposal for the ''Lockheed L-206''.<ref name=\"rhodes\">{{cite magazine |surname=Rhodes |given=Jeff |title=Willis Hawkins and the genesis of the Hercules |magazine=Code One Magazine |volume=19 |issue=3 |date=Third Quarter 2004 |url=https://www.codeonemagazine.com/article.html?item_id=143 |pages=[https://issuu.com/aviationlive/docs/2004-3/18 16]–21}}</ref> [[Hall Hibbard]], Lockheed vice president and chief engineer, saw the proposal and directed it to [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], who did not care for the low-speed, unarmed aircraft, and remarked, \"If you sign that letter, you will destroy the Lockheed Company.\"<ref name=\"rhodes\"/> Both Hibbard and Johnson signed the proposal and the company won the contract for the now-designated Model 82 on 2 July 1951.<ref name=\"boyne\">Boyne, Walter J.

Deliveries began in December 1956, continuing until the introduction of the ''C-130B'' model in 1959. Some A-models were equipped with [[ski]]s and re-designated ''C-130D''. As the C-130A became operational with [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC), the C-130's lack of range became apparent and additional fuel capacity was added with wing pylon-mounted tanks outboard of the engines; this added {{convert|6,000|lb|kg}} of fuel capacity for a total capacity of {{convert|40,000|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/docs/c-130-bar.htm |website= Fas.org |title= C-130 Broad Area Review}}</ref>\n\n===Improved versions===\n[[File:C-130E Hercules dropping flares.jpg|thumb|A [[Michigan Air National Guard]] C-130E dispatches its flares during a low-level training mission]]\n[[File:One U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft taxis as another takes off from Yeo Ju airstrip during the joint U.S.-South Korean Exercise Team Spirit '84 DF-ST-84-11567.jpg|thumb|Two C-130 Hercules in South Korea, 1984]]\n[[File:A C-130 Hercules from the 36th Airlift Squadron conducts a night flight mission over Yokota Air Base (26385249024).jpg|thumb|A C-130 conducts a night flight mission over [[Yokota Air Base]]]]\n\nThe C-130B model was developed to complement the A-models that had previously been delivered, and incorporated new features, particularly increased fuel capacity in the form of auxiliary tanks built into the center wing section and an AC electrical system. Four-bladed [[Hamilton Standard]] propellers replaced the Aero Products' three-blade propellers that distinguished the earlier A-models. The C-130B had [[aileron]]s operated by hydraulic pressure that was increased from {{convert|2050|to|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}, as well as uprated engines and four-blade propellers that were standard until the J-model.\n\nThe B model was originally intended to have \"blown controls\", a system that blows high-pressure air over the control surfaces to improve their effectiveness during slow flight. It was tested on an NC-130B prototype aircraft with a pair of T-56 turbines providing high-pressure air through a duct system to the control surfaces and flaps during landing. This greatly reduced landing speed to just 63 knots and cut landing distance in half. The system never entered service because it did not improve takeoff performance by the same margin, making the landing performance pointless if the aircraft could not also take off from where it had landed.<ref>Memoirs of an aeronautical engineer: flight testing at Ames Research Center. Seth B. Anderson, United States. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. History Office, Ames Research Center. p. 29</ref>\n\nAn electronic reconnaissance variant of the C-130B was designated C-130B-II. A total of 13 aircraft were converted. The C-130B-II was distinguished by its false external wing fuel tanks, which were disguised signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver antennas. These pods were slightly larger than the standard wing tanks found on other C-130Bs. Most aircraft featured a swept blade antenna on the upper fuselage, as well as extra wire antennas between the vertical fin and upper fuselage not found on other C-130s. Radio call numbers on the tail of these aircraft were regularly changed to confuse observers and disguise their true mission.\n\nThe extended-range ''C-130E'' model entered service in 1962 after it was developed as an interim long-range transport for the Military Air Transport Service. Essentially a B-model, the new designation was the result of the installation of {{convert|1,360|USgal|L|abbr=off|lk=in}} ''Sargent Fletcher'' external fuel tanks under each wing's midsection and more powerful [[Allison Engine Company|Allison]] T56-A-7A turboprops. The hydraulic boost pressure to the [[aileron]]s was reduced back to {{convert|2050|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} as a consequence of the external tanks' weight in the middle of the wingspan. The E model also featured structural improvements, [[avionics]] upgrades, and a higher gross weight. Australia took delivery of 12 C130E Hercules during 1966–67 to supplement the 12 C-130A models already in service with the RAAF. Sweden and Spain fly the TP-84T version of the C-130E fitted for aerial refueling capability.\n\nThe ''KC-130'' [[Tanker (aircraft)|tankers]], originally ''C-130F'' procured for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC) in 1958 (under the designation ''GV-1'') are equipped with a removable {{convert|3,600|USgal|L}} [[stainless steel]] [[fuel tank]] carried inside the cargo compartment. The two wing-mounted hose and drogue aerial refueling pods each transfer up to {{convert|300|USgal/min|L/min}} to two aircraft simultaneously, allowing for rapid cycle times of multiple-receiver aircraft formations, (a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes). The [[United States Navy|US Navy]]'s ''C-130G'' has increased structural strength allowing higher gross weight operation.\n\n===Further developments===\n[[File:Lockheed C-130H-30 Hercules (L-382T), Cameroon - Air Force AN0193846.jpg|thumb|A [[Cameroon Air Force]] C-130H, 1989]]\n\nThe ''C-130H'' model has updated Allison T56-A-15 turboprops, a redesigned outer [[wing]], updated avionics, and other minor improvements. Later ''H'' models had a new, fatigue-life-improved, center wing that was retrofitted to many earlier H-models. For structural reasons, some models are required to land with reduced amounts of fuel when carrying heavy cargo, reducing usable range.<ref>Cassidy, J. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20160223035513/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA391744 C-130 Transportability of Army Vehicles]\" p. 3. ''[[Defense Technical Information Center]]'', 2001</ref>\n\nThe H model remains in widespread use with the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and many foreign air forces. Initial deliveries began in 1964 (to the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]]), remaining in production until 1996. An improved C-130H was introduced in 1974, with Australia purchasing 12 of the type in 1978 to replace the original 12 C-130A models, which had first entered [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) service in 1958. The U.S. Coast Guard employs the HC-130H for long-range search and rescue, drug interdiction, illegal migrant patrols, homeland security, and logistics.\n\nC-130H models produced from 1992 to 1996 were designated as C-130H3 by the USAF, with the \"3\" denoting the third variation in design for the H series. Improvements included [[ring laser gyro]]s for the [[Inertial guidance system|INU]]s, GPS receivers, a partial [[glass cockpit]] (ADI and HSI instruments), a more capable APN-241 color radar, [[night vision device]] compatible instrument lighting, and an integrated radar and missile warning system. The electrical system upgrade included Generator Control Units (GCU) and Bus Switching units (BSU) to provide stable power to the more sensitive upgraded components.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Petrescu |first1=Relly Victoria |last2=Petrescu |first2=Florian Ion |title=Lockheed Martin |date=2013 |publisher=Books on Demand GmBH, Norderstedt |location=Germany |isbn=978-3-8482-6053-9 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49QmlNcqlUAC&pg=PA11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:raf.hercules.c-130k.c3.arp.jpg|thumb|A [[Royal Air Force]] C-130K (C.3)]]\nThe equivalent model for export to the UK is the ''C-130K'', known by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) as the ''Hercules C.1''. The ''C-130H-30'' (''Hercules C.3'' in RAF service) is a stretched version of the original Hercules, achieved by inserting a {{convert|100|in|m|abbr=on}} plug aft of the cockpit and an {{convert|80|in|m|abbr=on}} plug at the rear of the fuselage. A single C-130K was purchased by the [[Met Office]] for use by its Meteorological Research Flight, where it was classified as the ''Hercules W.2''. This aircraft was heavily modified, with its most prominent feature being the long red and white striped atmospheric probe on the nose and the move of the weather radar into a pod above the forward fuselage. This aircraft, named ''[[Snoopy]]'', was withdrawn in 2001 and was then modified by [[Marshall Aerospace|Marshall of Cambridge Aerospace]] as a flight testbed for the [[A400M]] turbine engine, the [[TP400]]. The C-130K is used by the [[RAF Falcons]] for parachute drops. Three C-130Ks (Hercules C Mk.1P) were upgraded and sold to the Austrian Air Force in 2002.<ref>[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/luftfahrzeuge/c130.htm \"C-130K in the Austrian Air Force.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605224813/http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/luftfahrzeuge/c130.htm |date=5 June 2008}} ''doppeladler.com''.

The [[EC-130 Commando Solo]] is another special missions variant within AFSOC, albeit operated solely by an AFSOC-gained wing in the [[Pennsylvania Air National Guard]], and is a psychological operations/information operations (PSYOP/IO) platform equipped as an aerial radio station and television stations able to transmit messaging over commercial frequencies. Other versions of the [[Lockheed EC-130|EC-130]], most notably the [[EC-130H Compass Call]], are also special variants, but are assigned to the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC). The [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunship]] was first developed during the [[Vietnam War]] to provide [[close air support]] and other [[ground-attack aircraft|ground-attack]] duties.\n\nThe ''[[Lockheed HC-130|HC-130]]'' is a family of long-range search and rescue variants used by the USAF and the U.S. Coast Guard. Equipped for the deep deployment of [[Air Force Pararescue|Pararescuemen]] (PJs), survival equipment, and (in the case of USAF versions) aerial refueling of combat rescue helicopters, HC-130s are usually the on-scene command aircraft for combat SAR missions (USAF only) and non-combat SAR (USAF and USCG). Early USAF versions were also equipped with the [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system]], designed to pull a person off the ground using a wire strung from a helium balloon. The John Wayne movie ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' features its use. The Fulton system was later removed when aerial refueling of helicopters proved safer and more versatile. The movie ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'' depicts a real-life SAR mission involving aerial refueling of a [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60 Pave Hawk|HH-60G]] by a New York Air National Guard HC-130P.\n\nThe ''C-130R'' and ''C-130T'' are U.S. Navy and USMC models, both equipped with underwing external fuel tanks. The USN C-130T is similar but has additional avionics improvements. In both models, aircraft are equipped with Allison T56-A-16 engines. The USMC versions are designated ''KC-130R'' or ''KC-130T'' when equipped with underwing refueling pods and pylons and are fully [[Night vision device|night vision]] system compatible.\n\nThe RC-130 is a [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance]] version. A single example is used by the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]], the aircraft having originally been sold to the former [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]].\n\nThe ''[[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|Lockheed L-100 (L-382)]]'' is a civilian variant, equivalent to a C-130E model without military equipment. The L-100 also has two stretched versions.\n\n===Next generation===\n{{main|Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules}}\n\nIn the 1970s, Lockheed proposed a C-130 variant with [[turbofan]] engines rather than turboprops, but the U.S. Air Force preferred the takeoff performance of the existing aircraft. In the 1980s, the C-130 was intended to be replaced by the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project. The project was canceled and the C-130 has remained in production.\n\nBuilding on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin modified a commercial variant of the C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB). This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/C130.html NASA and Lockheed Martin Partners In C-130 Technology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614010311/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/C130.html |date=14 June 2013}} Retrieved 21 May 2013.</ref> Modifications made to the HTTB included extended chord ailerons, a long chord rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and dorsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct mechanical linkages assisted by hydraulic boost, to fully powered controls, in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the hydraulic control valves of the appropriate boost unit.<ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/aero/documents/global-sustainment/product-support/Service-News/V12N3.pdf The High Technology Test Bed] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123150753/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/aero/documents/global-sustainment/product-support/Service-News/V12N3.pdf |date=23 January 2013}} Lockheed Service News Vol. 12 No. 3, September 1985.

After the failure of the [[Black Cat Squadron]] to plant operating sensor pods near the [[Lop Nur]] Nuclear Weapons Test Base using a U-2, the [[CIA]] developed a plan, named ''Heavy Tea'', to deploy two battery-powered sensor pallets near the base. To deploy the pallets, a Black Bat Squadron crew was trained in the U.S. to fly the C-130 Hercules. The crew of 12, led by Col Sun Pei Zhen, took off from [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base]] in an unmarked U.S. Air Force C-130E on 17 May 1969. Flying for six and a half hours at low altitude in the dark, they arrived over the target and the sensor pallets were dropped by parachute near Anxi in Gansu province. After another six and a half hours of low-altitude flight, they arrived back at Takhli. The sensors worked and uploaded data to a U.S. intelligence satellite for six months before their batteries failed. The Chinese conducted two nuclear tests, on 22 September 1969 and 29 September 1969, during the operating life of the sensor pallets.

It is a single-sided, 170 kB version of the [[Commodore 1571]], released as a stopgap measure when [[Commodore International]] was unable to provide sufficient quantities of 1571s due to a shortage of double-sided drive mechanisms (which were supplied by an outside manufacturer). Like the 1571, it can read and write both [[Group Coded Recording|GCR]] and [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] disk formats.\nThe 1570 utilizes a 1571 logic board in a cream-colored [[Commodore 1541|original-1541]]-like case with a drive mechanism similar to the 1541's except that it was equipped with track-zero detection. Like the 1571, its built-in DOS provides a data burst mode for transferring data to the C128 computer at a faster speed than a 1541 can. Its [[Read-only memory|ROM]] also contains some DOS bug fixes that didn't appear in the 1571 until much later. The 1570 can read and write all single-sided [[CP/M operating system|CP/M]]-format disks that the 1571 can access.\n\nAlthough the 1570 is compatible with the [[Commodore 64]], the C64 isn't capable of taking advantage of the drive's higher-speed operation, and when used with the C64 it's little more than a pricier 1541. Also, many early buyers of the C128 chose to temporarily make do with a 1541 drive, perhaps owned as part of a previous C64 setup, until the 1571 became more widely available.\n\nThe drive uses the CPU [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]], floppy controller [[Western Digital FD1771|WD1770]] or WD1772, I/O controllers 2x [[MOS Technology 6522]] and 1x [[MOS Technology 6526]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commodore disk drives}}\n\n[[Category:Commodore 64]]\n[[Category:CBM floppy disk drives]]","_bytes":3421,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2022-11-16T00:14:14Z"},"title":"Commodore 1570","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}

It was approved and promulgated under the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–1990)|military dictatorship]] headed by [[Augusto Pinochet]], being ratified by the Chilean citizenry through a [[1980 Chilean constitutional referendum|referendum]] on September 11, 1980, although being held under restrictions and without electoral registers.

It was amended for the first time in 1989 (through a [[1989 Chilean constitutional referendum|referendum]]), and afterward in 1991, 1994, 1997, each year from 1999 to 2001, 2003, each year from 2007 to 2015, and each year from 2017 to 2021, with the last three amendments concerning the constituent process of 2020–2022. In September 2005, under [[Ricardo Lagos]]'s presidency, a large amendment of the Constitution was approved by parliamentarians, removing from the text some of the less democratic dispositions coming from Pinochet's regime, such as [[Senator for life|senators-for-life]] and appointed senators, as well as the [[Military of Chile|armed forces]]' warranty of the [[Democracy|democratic]] regime.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Constitutional history of Chile |url=https://constitutionnet.org/country/constitutional-history-chile |access-date=2023-07-05 |website=ConstitutionNet |language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn November 15, 2019, following a [[2019–2021 Chilean protests|series of popular protests in October 2019]], a political agreement between parties with parliamentary representation called for a national referendum on the proposal of writing a new Constitution and on the mechanism to draft it.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cuffe |first1=Sandra |title=Chile agrees to hold referendum on constitution: 5 things to know |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/15/chile-agrees-to-hold-referendum-on-constitution-5-things-to-know |work=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}</ref> A [[2020 Chilean national plebiscite|plebiscite]] held on October 25, 2020, approved drafting a new fundamental charter, as well as choosing by popular vote delegates to a [[Constitutional Convention (Chile)|Constitutional Convention]] which was to fulfill this objective.

First, the constitutional commission was not representative of the [[political spectrum]] of Chile: its members had been handpicked by the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Pinochet dictatorship]], and opponents of the regime had been deliberately excluded. Secondly, the constitution's approval was achieved by the government in a controversial and tightly controlled referendum in 1980.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Cazor Aliste |first=Camel |date=2000 |title=Democracia y constitucion en Chile |url=http://mingaonline.uach.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-09502000000100003&script=sci_arttext |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518062933/http://mingaonline.uach.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-09502000000100003&script=sci_arttext |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-05-18 |journal=[[Revista de Derecho]] |publisher=[[Austral University of Chile]] |volume=IX |pages=25–34 |access-date=30 April 2015 }}</ref> Campaigning for the referendum was irregular, with the government calling people to vote positively on the reform, and also using radio and television commercial spots, while the opposition urging people to vote negatively were only able of doing small public demonstrations, without access to television time and limited radio access.
