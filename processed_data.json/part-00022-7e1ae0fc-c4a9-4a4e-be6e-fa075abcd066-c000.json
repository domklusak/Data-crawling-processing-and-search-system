The film is a loose [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the 1785 novel (first published in 1904) ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'' by [[Marquis de Sade]], updating the story's setting to the [[World War II]] era. It was Pasolini's final film, being released three weeks after [[Pier Paolo Pasolini#Murder|his murder]].\n\nThe film focuses on four wealthy, corrupt Italian [[libertine]]s in the time of the fascist [[Republic of Salò]] (1943–1945). The libertines kidnap 18 teenagers and subject them to four months of extreme violence, [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], and [[Sexual torture|sexual]]{{dn|date=June 2023}} and [[Psychological torture|psychological]] [[torture]]. The film explores themes of [[political corruption]], [[consumerism]], [[authoritarianism]], [[nihilism]], [[morality]], [[capitalism]], [[totalitarianism]], sadism, [[sexuality]], and [[fascism]]. The story is in four segments, inspired by [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'': the Anteinferno, the Circle of Manias, the Circle of Shit, and the Circle of Blood. The film also contains frequent references to and several discussions of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s 1887 book ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', [[Ezra Pound]]'s poem ''[[The Cantos]]'', and [[Marcel Proust]]'s [[novel sequence]] ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''.\n\nPremiering at the Paris Film Festival on 23 November 1975, the film had a brief theatrical run in Italy before being [[Film censorship|banned]] in January 1976, and was released in the United States the following year on 3 October 1977. Because it depicts youths subjected to graphic violence, torture, sexual abuse, and murder, the film was controversial upon its release and has remained banned in many countries.\n\nThe confluence of thematic content in the film—ranging from the political and socio-historical, to psychological and sexual—has led to much critical discussion. It has been both praised and decried by various film historians and critics and was named the 65th-scariest film ever made by the [[Chicago Film Critics Association]] in 2006.<ref name=\"Chicago Film Critics Association\">{{cite web|author=Chicago Film Critics Association|url=http://www.filmspotting.net/top100.htm|title=Top 100 Scariest Movies|date=October 2006|publisher=[[Filmspotting]]|access-date=21 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117102530/http://www.filmspotting.net/top100.htm |archive-date=17 January 2008}}</ref> It is also the subject of an entry in ''[[The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural]]'' (1986).<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Salò – The 120 Days of Sodom|author=Campbell, Ramsey|author-link=Ramsey Campbell|title=The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural|editor=Sullivan, Jack|editor-link=Jack Sullivan (literary scholar)|page=[https://archive.org/details/penguinencyclope00sull/page/368 368]|publisher=Penguin|year=1986|isbn=978-0-670-80902-8|title-link=The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma 1.jpg|thumb|Scene from the film]]\nThe film is separated into four segments with intertitles, inspired by [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'':<ref>{{cite book|title=Post-Politics in Context|author=Taskale, Ali Raza|page=59|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn= 978-1-317-28249-5}}</ref>\n\n===Anteinferno===\n\nIn 1944, in the Republic of Salò, the Fascist-occupied portion of Italy, four wealthy men of power – the Duke, the Bishop, the Magistrate, and the President – agree to marry each other's daughters as the first step in a debauched ritual. They rule that when they get to the mansion, their daughters must be completely naked at all times. They recruit four teenage boys to act as guards (dressed with uniforms of [[Decima Flottiglia MAS]]) and four young soldiers (called \"studs\", \"cockmongers\", or \"fuckers\"), who are chosen because of their large penises. The army and secret police is sent to round up many youths, of whom nine young men and nine young women are hand-picked and brought to a palace near [[Marzabotto]]. One of the boys tries to escape on the way, but is shot dead.\n\n===Circle of Manias / {{lang|it|Girone delle Manie}}===\n\nAccompanying the libertines at the palace are four middle-aged [[Prostitution|prostitutes]], also collaborators, whose job it is to orchestrate debauched interludes for the men, who sadistically exploit their victims. During the many days at the palace, the four men devise increasingly abhorrent tortures and humiliations for their own pleasure. During breakfast, the daughters enter the dining hall naked to serve food. One of the studs trips and rapes a daughter in front of the crowd, who laugh at her cries of pain. Intrigued, the President moons several slaves before prompting the stud to perform [[anal sex]] on him and the Duke sings \"{{lang|it|italic=no|Sul Ponte di perati}}\". Signora Vaccari uses a mannequin to demonstrate to the young men and women how to properly [[masturbate]] a penis and one of the girls tries to escape, only to have her throat cut. Signora Vaccari continues with her story. Two victims named Sergio and Renata are forced to get married. The ceremony is interrupted when the Duke fondles several victims and prostitutes. At the end, Sergio and Renata are forced to fondle each other and the men rape them to stop them from having sex with each other. During this, the Magistrate engages with the Duke in three-way intercourse.\n\nOn another day, the victims are forced to get naked and act like dogs. When one of the victims, Lamberto, refuses, the Magistrate [[Flagellation|whips]] him and tortures the President's daughter by tricking her into eating a slice of [[polenta]] containing nails.\n\n===Circle of Shit / {{lang|it|Girone della Merda}}===\n\nSignora Maggi relates her troubled childhood and her [[coprophilia]]. As she tells her story, the President notices that one of the studs has an erection and fondles him; another stud uses a female victim's hand to masturbate himself. She also explains how she killed her mother over a dispute about her prostitution and Renata cries, remembering the murder of her own mother. The Duke, sexually excited at the sound of her cries, begins verbally abusing her. The Duke orders the guards and studs to undress her. During this, she begs [[God]] for death and the Duke punishes her by defecating on the floor and forcing her to eat his feces with a spoon. The President leaves to masturbate. Later, at a mock wedding reception for the Magistrate and Sergio, the victims are presented with a meal of human feces. During a search for the victim with the most beautiful buttocks, Franco is picked and promised death in the future.\n\n===Circle of Blood / {{lang|it|Girone del Sangue}}===\n\nLater, there is a [[Black Mass]]-[[Same-sex marriage|like wedding between]] the studs and the men of power while the latter are dressed in drag. The men angrily order the children to laugh, but they are too grief-stricken to do so. The Pianist and Signora Vaccari tell dark jokes to make the victims laugh. The wedding ceremony ensues with each man of power exchanging rings with a stud. After the wedding, the Bishop consummates the marriage and receives intense anal sex from his stud. The Bishop then leaves to examine the captives in their rooms, where they start systematically betraying each other: Claudio reveals that Graziella is hiding a photograph, Graziella reveals that Eva and Antiniska are having a secret sexual affair. Victim Umberto is appointed to replace Ezio, who is shot to death for having sex with one of the staff and revealing himself to be a communist.\n\nToward the end, the remaining victims are called out to determine which of them will be punished. Graziella is spared due to her betrayal of Eva, and Rino is spared due to his submissive relationship with the Duke. Those who are called are given a blue ribbon and sentenced to a painful death, while those who have not been called, as long as they kept collaborating with the libertines, can hope to return home. The victims huddle together and cry and [[prayer|pray]] in the bathroom. They are then taken outside and raped, tortured and murdered through methods such as [[Human branding|branding]], [[hanging]], [[scalping]], burning and having their tongues and eyes cut out, as each libertine takes his turn to watch as a [[Voyeurism|voyeur]]. The soldiers shake hands and bid each other farewell. The Pianist, looking out an open window, suddenly realises with horror what atrocities are being committed and, climbing out, throws herself to her death.\n\nTwo young soldiers, who had witnessed and collaborated in all the atrocities, dance a simple [[waltz]] together; one asks the name of the other's girlfriend back at home.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n[[File:Bonacelli-Salò.jpg|thumb|[[Paolo Bonacelli]] as the Duke]] \n[[File:Salo6.jpg|thumb|[[Franco Merli]] in the film]]\n[[File:Salo5.jpg|thumb|Caterina Boratto as Signora Castelli]]\n{{Col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Masters'''\n*[[Paolo Bonacelli]] (dubbed by Giancarlo Vigorelli) as The [[Duke of Blangis|Duke]]; tall, strongly built, bearded, [[Chauvinism|chauvinistic]], very sadistic and a fanatic fascist; enjoys tormenting female victims with verbal abuse and degrading them, his favorite victims being Renata and Fatimah.

Pasolini established that the violent scenes in ''Salò'' were symbolic and reduced the romanticism of his previous films, although knowing that once the film was premiered would be considered as damned.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} As a continuation, Pasolini planned to make a biographical film about the life of child murderer [[Gilles de Rais]], but died.\n\n===Casting===\nInitially, [[Ninetto Davoli]] was chosen to play Claudio, a young collaborationist, but due to legal problems he had to decline, the role being replaced by Claudio Troccoli, a young man who had a similarity to Davoli in his first films. Pupi Avati, being the writer, is not officially accredited also due to legal problems. Most of the actors of the cast, although they were natural performers, were non-professionals with minimal or no prior on-camera acting experience. Many of them were models, cast for their willingness to appear naked on-screen.\n\n[[Franco Merli]] was considered like a prototype of the Pasolinian boy.

Commenting on the film's prevalent sexual themes, horror film scholar Stephen Barber writes: \"The core of ''Salò'' is the [[anus]], and its narrative drive pivots around the act of [[sodomy]]. No scene of a sex act has been confirmed in the film until one of the libertines has approached its participants and sodomized the figure committing the act. The filmic material of ''Salò'' is one that compacts celluloid and feces, in Pasolini's desire to burst the limits of cinema, via the anally resonant eye of the film lens.\"{{sfn|Barber|2010|p=100}} Barber also notes that Pasolini's film reduces the extent of the storytelling sequences present in de Sade's ''The 120 Days of Sodom'' so that they \"possess equal status\" with the sadistic acts committed by the libertines.{{sfn|Barber|2010|pages=99–102}}\n\nPasolini scholar Gian Annovi notes in the book ''Pier Paolo Pasolini: Performing Authorship'' (2007) that ''Salò'' is stylistically and thematically marked by a \"link between [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]]'s [[Dada]] aesthetics and the perverse dynamics of desire\", which, according to Annovi, became artistic points of interest for Pasolini in the early developments of ''Salò''.{{sfn|Annovi|2007|p=176}}\n\nDallas Marshall for [[Film Inquiry]] wrote in an article from 2021 that \"Salò is his [Pasolini's] strongest diatribe against consumerism\",<ref>https://www.filminquiry.com/salo-a-film-about-power/</ref> and other critics <ref>https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4908/salo-the-unseen-movie</ref> have brought up that the film is to be seen as symbolism; a metaphor for the modern society, capitalism, and especially consumerism, i.e how \"those in power can make people consume crap (ads, commercials, etc) and those of the people who resist die, and the majority passively obeys and goes along with the system, and a few will collaborate with the rulers\". The Film Inquiry article also mentions this metaphor: \n\"Much like the citizens of fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, the prisoners were eating up the bullshit of dictators. But it goes deeper than that because one of the aspects of modern society that Pasolini had a great disdain for was mass consumerism. The man viewed consumerism, especially that of processed foods, to be pesticide on the human soul and eating literal excrement. He yearned for the days of classical beauty and good food that nourished the body. He viewed the modern world as a perversion and was thoroughly disgusted with its trajectory.\"<ref>https://www.filminquiry.com/salo-a-film-about-power/</ref> The BBFC notes that the film \"is intended as a critique of both fascism and consumerism\".<ref>https://www.bbfc.co.uk/education/case-studies/salo-120-days-of-sodom</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Salò'' has earned a reputation among some film scholars for being the \"sickest film of all time\",{{sfn|Mathjis|Sexton|2011|p=106}}<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mathjis, Ernest|author2=Mendik, Xavier|title=100 Cult Films|page=177|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn= 978-1-844-57571-8}}</ref> with some citing it as an early progenitor of the [[extreme cinema]] subgenre, alongside the American film ''[[The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972).<ref>{{cite book|title=Transnational Horror Across Visual Media: Fragmented Bodies|chapter='You Had Me at \"I'm Dead{{\"'}}: Porn, Horror, and the Fragmented Body|author1=Hyland, Jenn|author2=Shorey, Eric|page=176|publisher=Routledge|editor1= Och, Dana|editor2=Strayer, Kirsten|year=2013|isbn= 978-1-136-74484-6}}</ref>\n\nFilm scholar Matthias Frey notes that the cross-section between the film's thematic content and graphic visuals has resulted in it being considered both a horror film as well as an [[art film]]:\n\n{{blockquote|[Films like ''Salò''], which are usually considered by critics as 'works' by the 'artists'&nbsp;... might be received in practice also by individuals who watch ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' or ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' or any 'popular' or cult horror film.<ref name=frey>{{cite book|author=Frey, Mattias|page=114|chapter=The Ethics of Extreme Cinema|title=Cine-Ethics: Ethical Dimensions of Film Theory, Practice, and Spectatorship|editor1=Choi, Jinhee|editor2=Frey, Mattias|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 978-1-136-74596-6}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1979, [[Akiyoshi Umekawa]] attempted to reenact scenes from the film during a combination bank robbery and mass murder.\n\nIn 2006, the [[Chicago Film Critics Association]] named it the 65th-scariest film ever made.<ref name=\"Chicago Film Critics Association\"/>\n\nIn 2010, the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] placed it at no. 47 on its list of \"The Essential 100 films\".<ref name=\"Toronto International Film Festival\">{{cite web|title=The Essential 100|url=http://tiff.net/essential/about/essential100|work=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|publisher=Toronto International Film Festival Inc.|access-date=22 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226144923/http://tiff.net/essential/about/essential100|archive-date=2010-12-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, British opera director [[David McVicar]] and Swiss conductor [[Philippe Jordan]] produced a performance of the [[Richard Strauss]] opera ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' (1905) based on the film, setting it in a debauched palace in Nazi Germany, for the [[Royal Opera House]] in London, with [[Nadja Michael]] as [[Salome]], [[Michaela Schuster]] as [[Herodias]], [[Thomas Moser]] as [[Herod Antipas|Herod]], [[Joseph Kaiser]] as Narraboth, and [[Michael Volle]] as [[John the Baptist|Jokanaan]].

The design distinguished between [[computer architecture|architecture]] and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the only partially compatible [[IBM System/360 Model 44|Model 44]] and the most expensive systems use [[microcode]] to implement the instruction set, featuring [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] byte addressing and binary, decimal and [[IBM hexadecimal floating-point|hexadecimal]] [[floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] calculations.\n\nThe System/360 family introduced IBM's [[Solid Logic Technology]] (SLT), which packed more transistors onto a circuit card, allowing more powerful but smaller computers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why won't you DIE?

Up to 8 megabytes of slower (8 microsecond) [[IBM 2361 Large Capacity Storage|Large Capacity Storage (LCS)]] was also available for some models.\n\nThe IBM 360 was extremely successful, allowing customers to purchase a smaller system knowing they could expand it, if their needs grew, without reprogramming application software or replacing peripheral devices. It influenced computer design for years to come; many consider it one of history's most successful computers.\n\nSystem/360's chief architect was [[Gene Amdahl]], and the project was managed by [[Fred Brooks]], responsible to Chairman [[Thomas J. Watson Jr.]]<ref name=\"PA\">\"System/360 Announcement\" (press release), IBM Data Processing Division, April 7, 1964, webpage: [http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PR360.html IBM-PR360]: states cycle time from \"...millionth-of-a-second to only 200 billionths-of-a-second,\" and \"...memory capacity ranges from 8,000 characters of information to more than 8,000,000.\"</ref> The commercial release was piloted by another of Watson's lieutenants, [[John R.

This feat allowed customers to use a cheaper model and then upgrade to larger systems as their needs increased without the time and expense of rewriting software. Before the introduction of System/360, business and scientific applications used different computers with different instruction sets and operating systems. Different-sized computers also had their own instruction sets. IBM was the first manufacturer to exploit [[microcode]] technology to implement a compatible range of computers of widely differing performance, although the largest, fastest models had hard-wired logic instead.\n\nThis flexibility greatly lowered barriers to entry. With most other vendors customers had to choose between machines they could outgrow and machines that were potentially too powerful and thus too costly. This meant that many companies simply did not buy computers.\n\n===Models===\nIBM initially announced a series of six computers and forty common peripherals. IBM eventually delivered fourteen models, including rare one-off models for [[NASA]]. The least expensive model was the [[IBM System/360 Model 20|Model 20]] with as little as 4096 bytes of [[magnetic-core memory|core memory]], eight 16-bit registers instead of the sixteen 32-bit registers of other System/360 models, and an [[instruction set]] that was a subset of that used by the rest of the range.\n\nThe initial announcement in 1964 included Models [[IBM System/360 Model 30|30]], [[IBM System/360 Model 40|40]], [[IBM System/360 Model 50|50]], 60, 62, and 70. The first three were low- to middle-range systems aimed at the [[IBM 1400 series]] market. All three first shipped in mid-1965. The last three, intended to replace the [[IBM 700/7000 series|7000 series]] machines, never shipped and were replaced with the [[IBM System/360 Model 65|65]] and [[IBM System/360 Model 75|75]], which were first delivered in November 1965, and January 1966, respectively.\n\nLater additions to the low-end included models [[IBM System/360 Model 20|20]] (1966, mentioned above), [[IBM System/360 Model 22|22]] (1971), and 25 (1968). The Model 20 had several sub-models; sub-model 5 was at the higher end of the model. The Model 22 was a recycled Model 30 with minor limitations: a smaller maximum memory configuration, and slower I/O channels, which limited it to slower and lower-capacity disk and tape devices than on the 30.\n\nThe [[IBM System/360 Model 44|Model 44]] (1966) was a specialized model, designed for scientific computing and for real-time computing and process control, featuring some additional instructions, and with all storage-to-storage instructions and five other complex instructions eliminated.\n[[File:360-91-panel.jpg|thumb|220px|[[IBM System/360 Model 91]] operator's [[system console|console]] at NASA, sometime in the late 1960s.]]\n[[File:IBM magnetic core.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Magnetic-core memory, probably from a 360]]\n\nA succession of high-end machines included the [[IBM System/360-67|Model 67]] (1966, mentioned below, briefly anticipated as the 64 and 66<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0694645|title=System/360 Time Sharing Computers|magazine=DIGITAL COMPUTER NEWSLETTER|volume=17|issue=3|publisher=Office of Naval Research, Mathematical Sciences Division|date=July 1965|pages=5–6}}</ref>), 85 (1969), [[IBM System/360 Model 91|91]] (1967, anticipated as the 92), 95 (1968), and 195 (1971). The 85 design was intermediate between the System/360 line and the follow-on [[IBM System/370|System/370]] and was the basis for the 370/165. There was a System/370 version of the 195, but it did not include Dynamic Address Translation.\n\nThe implementations differed substantially, using different native data path widths, presence or absence of microcode, yet were extremely compatible. Except where specifically documented, the models were architecturally compatible. The [[IBM System/360 Model 91|91]], for example, was designed for scientific computing and provided [[Out-of-order execution|out-of-order instruction execution]] (and could yield \"imprecise interrupts\" if a program trap occurred while several instructions were being read), but lacked the decimal instruction set used in commercial applications. New features could be added without violating architectural definitions: the 65 had a dual-processor version (M65MP) with extensions for inter-CPU signalling; the 85 introduced cache memory. Models 44, 75, 91, 95, and 195 were implemented with hardwired logic, rather than microcoded as all other models.\n\nThe [[IBM System/360 Model 67|Model 67]], announced in August 1965, was the first production IBM system to offer [[Virtual memory|dynamic address translation]] (virtual memory) hardware to support [[time-sharing]]. \"DAT\" is now more commonly referred to as an [[memory management unit|MMU]]. An experimental one-off unit was built based on a model 40. Before the 67, IBM had announced models 64 and 66, DAT versions of the 60 and 62, but they were almost immediately replaced with the 67 at the same time that the 60 and 62 were replaced with the 65. DAT hardware would reappear in the [[S/370]] series in 1972, though it was initially absent from the series. Like its close relative, the 65, the 67 also offered dual CPUs.\n\nIBM stopped marketing all System/360 models by the end of 1977.<ref>{{cite web\n | url       = http://www.vm.ibm.com/devpages/jelliott/pdfs/zhistory.pdf\n | title     = IBM Mainframes – 45+ Years of Evolution\n | last      = Elliott\n | first     = Jim\n | publisher = IBM Canada Ltd.\n | page      = 17\n | year      = 2010}} shows the announcement, ship and withdrawal dates for all S/360 models other than the transient models 64 and 66</ref>\n\n===Backward compatibility===\nIBM's existing customers had a large investment in software that ran on [[Transistor computer|second-generation machines]].

This capability was not included in System/370; bit 12 of the PSW was redefined to switch between System/360 (BC mode) and System/370 (EC mode) PSW format.</ref>\n* [[9-track tape|Nine-track magnetic tape]]\n\n===Architectural overview===\n{{Main|IBM System/360 architecture}}\n\nThe System/360 series has a [[Computer architecture|computer system architecture]] specification.<ref name=A22-6821/><ref name=A22-6821-8/><ref name=A22-6843/> This specification makes no assumptions on the implementation itself, but rather describes the interfaces and expected behavior of an implementation. The architecture describes mandatory interfaces that must be available on all implementations, and optional interfaces. Some aspects of this architecture are:\n* [[Big endian]] byte ordering\n* A processor with:\n** 16 [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] [[general-purpose register]]s (R0–R15)\n** A 64-bit [[program status word]] (PSW), which describes (among other things)\n*** [[Interrupt]] masks\n*** Privilege states\n*** A condition code\n*** A 24-bit [[program counter|instruction address]]\n** An interruption mechanism, [[interrupt|maskable]] and unmaskable interruption classes and subclasses\n** An [[instruction set]]. Each instruction is wholly described and also defines the conditions under which an exception is recognized in the form of program interruption.\n* A [[primary storage|memory (called storage) subsystem]] with:\n** 8 bits per byte\n** A special processor communication area starting at address 0\n** 24-bit addressing\n* Manual control operations that allow\n** A [[booting|bootstrap]] process (a process called Initial Program Load or IPL)\n** Operator-initiated interrupts\n** Resetting the system\n** Basic debugging facilities\n** Manual display and modifications of the system's state (memory and processor)\n* An Input/Output mechanism{{snd}} which does not describe the devices themselves\n\nSome of the optional features are:\n* [[Binary-coded decimal]] instructions\n* [[Floating-point arithmetic|Floating-point]] instructions\n* Timing facilities (interval timer)\n* [[Memory protection key|Key-controlled memory protection]]\n\nAll models of System/360, except for the Model 20 and Model 44, implemented that specification.\n\nBinary arithmetic and logical operations are performed as register-to-register and as memory-to-register/register-to-memory as a standard feature. If the Commercial Instruction Set option was installed, [[Binary-coded decimal|packed decimal]] arithmetic could be performed as memory-to-memory with some memory-to-register operations. The Scientific Instruction Set feature, if installed, provided access to four [[floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] registers that could be programmed for either [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] or [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] floating-point operations. The Models 85 and 195 could also operate on 128-bit extended-precision floating-point numbers stored in pairs of floating-point registers, and software provided emulation in other models. The System/360 used an 8-bit byte, 32-bit word, 64-bit double-word, and 4-bit [[nybble|nibble]]. Machine instructions had operators with operands, which could contain register numbers or memory addresses. This complex combination of instruction options resulted in a variety of instruction lengths and formats.\n\nMemory addressing was accomplished using a base-plus-displacement scheme, with registers 1 through F (15). A displacement was encoded in 12 bits, thus allowing a 4096-byte displacement (0–4095), as the offset from the address put in a base register.\n\nRegister 0 could not be used as a base register nor as an index register (nor as a branch address register), as \"0\" was reserved to indicate an address in the first 4&nbsp;KB of memory, that is, if register 0 was specified as described, the value 0x00000000 was implicitly input to the effective address calculation in place of whatever value might be contained within register 0 (or if specified as a branch address register, then no branch was taken, and the content of register 0 was ignored, but any side effect of the instruction was performed).\n\nThis specific behavior permitted initial execution of an interrupt routines, since base registers would not necessarily be set to 0 during the first few instruction cycles of an interrupt routine. It isn't needed for [[Initial Program Load|IPL]] (\"Initial Program Load\" or boot), as one can always clear a register without the need to save it.\n\nWith the exception of the Model 67,<ref name=GA27-2719/> all addresses were real memory addresses. Virtual memory was not available in most IBM mainframes until the [[System/370]] series. The Model 67 introduced a virtual memory architecture, which [[Michigan Terminal System|MTS]], [[CP-67]], and [[TSS/360]] used—but not IBM's mainline System/360 operating systems.\n\nThe System/360 machine-code instructions are 2 bytes long (no memory operands), 4 bytes long (one operand), or 6 bytes long (two operands). Instructions are always situated on 2-byte boundaries.\n\nOperations like MVC (Move-Characters) (Hex: D2) can only move at most 256 bytes of information. Moving more than 256 bytes of data required multiple MVC operations. (The [[System/370]] series introduced a family of more powerful instructions such as the MVCL \"Move-Characters-Long\" instruction, which supports moving up to 16&nbsp;MB as a single block.)\n\nAn operand is two bytes long, typically representing an address as a 4-bit [[nybble|nibble]] denoting a base register and a 12-bit displacement relative to the contents of that register, in the range {{mono|000–FFF}} (shown here as [[hexadecimal]] numbers). The address corresponding to that operand is the contents of the specified general-purpose register plus the displacement. For example, an MVC instruction that moves 256 bytes (with length code 255 in hexadecimal as {{mono|FF}}) from base register 7, plus displacement {{mono|000}}, to base register 8, plus displacement {{mono|001}}, would be coded as the 6-byte instruction \"{{mono|D2FF 8001 7000}}\" (operator/length/address1/address2).\n\nThe System/360 was designed to separate the ''system state'' from the ''problem state''. This provided a basic level of security and recoverability from programming errors. Problem (user) programs could not modify data or program storage associated with the system state. Addressing, data, or operation exception errors made the machine enter the system state through a controlled routine so the operating system could try to correct or terminate the program in error. Similarly, it could recover certain processor hardware errors through the ''machine check'' routines.\n\n===Channels===\n{{See also|Channel I/O}}\n\nPeripherals interfaced to the system via ''channels''. A channel is a specialized processor with the instruction set optimized for transferring data between a peripheral and main memory. In modern terms, this could be compared to [[direct memory access]] (DMA). The S/360 connects channels to control units with [[Bus and Tag|bus and tag]] cables; IBM eventually replaced these with [[ESCON|Enterprise Systems Connection]] (ESCON) and [[FICON|Fibre Connection]] (FICON) channels, but well after the S/360 era.\n\n===={{anchor|ByteMuxChan|SelectChan}}Byte-multiplexor and selector channels====<!-- anchor added for intra-article linking -->\nThere were initially two types of channels; byte-multiplexer channels (known at the time simply as \"multiplexor channels\"), for connecting \"slow speed\" devices such as card readers and punches, [[line printer]]s, and communications controllers, and selector channels for connecting high speed devices, such as [[disk drive]]s, [[tape drive]]s, data cells and [[drum memory|drums]]. Every System/360 (except for the Model 20, which was not a standard 360) has a byte-multiplexer channel and 1 or more selector channels, though the model 25 has just one channel, which can be either a byte-multiplexor or selector channel. The smaller models (up to the model 50) have integrated channels, while for the larger models (model 65 and above) the channels are large separate units in separate cabinets: the IBM 2870 is the byte-multiplexor channel with up to four selector sub-channels, and the IBM 2860 is up to three selector channels.\n\nThe byte-multiplexer channel is able to handle I/O to/from several devices simultaneously at the device's highest rated speeds, hence the name, as it [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] I/O from those devices onto a single data path to main memory. Devices connected to a byte-multiplexer channel are configured to operate in 1-byte, 2-byte, 4-byte, or \"burst\" mode. The larger \"blocks\" of data are used to handle progressively faster devices. For example, a 2501 card reader operating at 600 cards per minute would be in 1-byte mode, while a 1403-N1 printer would be in burst mode. Also, the byte-multiplexer channels on larger models have an optional selector subchannel section that would accommodate tape drives. The byte-multiplexor's channel address was typically \"0\" and the selector subchannel addresses were from \"C0\" to \"FF.\" Thus, tape drives on System/360 were commonly addressed at 0C0–0C7. Other common byte-multiplexer addresses are: 00A: 2501 Card Reader, 00C/00D: 2540 Reader/Punch, 00E/00F: 1403-N1 Printers, 010–013: 3211 Printers, 020–0BF: [[270x|2701/2703]] Telecommunications Units. These addresses are still commonly used in z/VM virtual machines.\n\nSystem/360 models 40 and 50 have an integrated 1052-7 console that is usually addressed as 01F, however, this was not connected to the byte-multiplexer channel, but rather, had a direct internal connection to the mainframe. The model 30 attached a different model of 1052 through a 1051 control unit. The models 60 through 75 also use the 1052-7.\n\n[[File:IBM 360 Bus Tag Cables.png|thumb|300px|Cable used as Bus or Tag cable for IBM System/360]]\n[[Image:IBM 360 Bus Tag Terms.JPG|thumb|300px|Bus and tag terminators]]\n\nSelector channels enabled I/O to high speed devices. These storage devices were attached to a control unit and then to the channel. The control unit let clusters of devices be attached to the channels. On higher speed models, multiple selector channels, which could operate simultaneously or in parallel, improved overall performance.\n\nControl units are connected to the channels with \"bus and tag\" cable pairs. The bus cables carried the address and data information and the tag cables identified what data was on the bus. The general configuration of a channel is to connect the devices in a chain, like this: Mainframe—Control Unit X—Control Unit Y—Control Unit Z. Each control unit is assigned a \"capture range\" of addresses that it services. For example, control unit X might capture addresses 40–4F, control unit Y: C0–DF, and control unit Z: 80–9F. Capture ranges had to be a multiple of 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 devices and be aligned on appropriate boundaries. Each control unit in turn has one or more devices attached to it. For example, you could have control unit Y with 6 disks, that would be addressed as C0-C5.\n\nThere are three general types of bus-and-tag cables produced by IBM. The first is the standard gray bus-and-tag cable, followed by the blue bus-and-tag cable, and finally the tan bus-and-tag cable. Generally, newer cable revisions are capable of higher speeds or longer distances, and some peripherals specified minimum cable revisions both upstream and downstream.\n\nThe cable ordering of the control units on the channel is also significant. Each control unit is \"strapped\" as High or Low priority. When a device selection was sent out on a mainframe's channel, the selection was sent from X->Y->Z->Y->X. If the control unit was \"high\" then the selection was checked in the outbound direction, if \"low\" then the inbound direction. Thus, control unit X was either 1st or 5th, Y was either 2nd or 4th, and Z was 3rd in line. It is also possible to have multiple channels attached to a control unit from the same or multiple mainframes, thus providing a rich high-performance, multiple-access, and backup capability.\n\nTypically the total cable length of a channel is limited to 200 feet, less being preferred. Each control unit accounts for about 10 \"feet\" of the 200-foot limit.\n\n===={{anchor|BMuxChan}}Block multiplexer channel====\nIBM first introduced a new type of I/O channel on the Model 85 and Model 195, the [[IBM 2880|2880]] block multiplexer channel, and then made them standard on the [[System/370]]. This channel allowed a device to suspend a channel program, pending the completion of an I/O operation and thus to free the channel for use by another device. A block multiplexer channel can support either standard 1.5&nbsp;MB/second connections or, with the 2-byte interface feature, 3&nbsp;MB/second; the latter use one tag cable and two bus cables. On the [[IBM System/370|S/370]] there is an option for a 3.0 MB/s data streaming<ref name=OEMI>{{cite book\n | title     = IBM System/360 and System/370 I/O Interface Channel to Control Unit Original Equipment Manufacturers' Information \n | section   = Data-Streaming Feature\n | pages     = 3-4&ndash;3-7\n | edition   = Tenth\n | date      = February 1988\n | publisher = IBM\n | url       = http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/370/channel/GA22-6974-9_360_370_IO_Interface_Channel_to_Control_Unit_OEM_Information_Feb88.pdf\n | mode      = cs2}}</ref> channel with one bus cable and one tag cable.\n\nThe initial use for this was the 2305 fixed-head disk, which has 8 \"exposures\" (alias addresses) and rotational position sensing (RPS).\n\nBlock multiplexer channels can operate as a selector channel to allow compatible attachment of legacy subsystems.<ref>{{cite book\n | title       = System/370 Principles of Operation\n | id          = GA22-7000-4\n | url         = http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/370/princOps/GA22-7000-4_370_Principles_Of_Operation_Sep75.pdf\n | publisher   = IBM\n | date        = September 1975\n | page        = 189\n | access-date = December 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Basic hardware components===\n[[File:IBM SLT card 03773.agr.jpg|thumb|A single-width [[Solid Logic Technology|SLT card]]. Each square metal can contains a [[hybrid circuit]] with several transistors.]]\n[[File:IBM SLT chip, side view.jpg|thumb|upright|Six-transistor solid logic hybrid circuit with cap off]]\n[[File:SLT Card Frame.corestore.jpg|thumb|upright|Many SLT cards plugged into an SLT backplane]]\n\nBeing uncertain of the reliability and availability of the then new monolithic [[integrated circuit]]s, IBM chose instead to design and manufacture its own custom [[hybrid integrated circuit]]s. These were built on 11&nbsp;mm square [[ceramic]] substrates. [[Resistor]]s were [[screen-printing|silk screened]] on and discrete [[glass]] encapsulated [[transistor]]s and [[diode]]s were added. The substrate was then covered with a metal lid or encapsulated in plastic to create a \"[[Solid Logic Technology]]\" (SLT) module.\n\nA number of these [https://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/vintage/vintage_4506VV3081.html SLT modules] were then [[flip chip]] mounted onto a small multi-layer [[printed circuit board|printed circuit]] \"SLT card\". Each card had one or two sockets on one edge that plugged onto pins on one of the computer's \"SLT boards\" (also referred to as a backplane). This was the reverse of how most other company's cards were mounted, where the cards had pins or [[Edge connector|printed contact areas]] and plugged into sockets on the computer's boards.\n\nUp to twenty SLT boards could be assembled side-by-side (vertically and horizontally, max 4 high by 5 wide) to form a \"logic gate\". Several gates mounted together constituted a box-shaped \"logic frame\". The outer gates were generally hinged along one vertical edge so they could be swung open to provide access to the fixed inner gates. The larger machines could have more than one frame bolted together to produce the final unit, such as a multi-frame Central Processing Unit (CPU).\n\n===Operating system software===\n{{Main|History of IBM mainframe operating systems#System/360 operating systems|l1=System/360 operating systems}}\n\nThe smaller System/360 models used the Basic Operating System/360 ([[BOS/360]]), Tape Operating System (TOS/360), or Disk Operating System/360 ([[DOS/360]], which evolved into DOS/VS, DOS/VSE, VSE/AF, VSE/SP, VSE/ESA, and then [[VSE (operating system)|z/VSE]]).\n\nThe larger models used [[OS/360 and successors|Operating System/360]] (OS/360). IBM developed several levels of OS/360, with increasingly powerful features: Primary Control Program (PCP), [[MFT (operating system)|Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks]] (MFT), and [[Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks]] (MVT). MVT took a long time to develop into a usable system, and the less ambitious MFT was widely used. PCP was used on intermediate machines too small to run MFT well, and on larger machines before MFT was available; the final releases of OS/360 included only MFT and MVT.  For the [[System/370]] and later machines, MFT evolved into [[OS/VS1]], while MVT evolved into [[OS/VS2 (SVS)]] (Single Virtual Storage), then various versions of [[MVS]] (Multiple Virtual Storage) culminating in the current [[z/OS]].\n\nWhen it announced the [[IBM System/360 Model 67|Model 67]] in August 1965, IBM also announced [[TSS/360]] (Time-Sharing System) for delivery at the same time as the 67. TSS/360, a response to [[Multics]], was an ambitious project that included many advanced features. It had performance problems, was delayed, canceled, reinstated, and finally canceled<ref group=NB>However, it could still be ordered, and a TSS/370 [[Request price quotation|PRPQ]] was available on the S/370 and went through multiple releases.</ref> again in 1971. Customers migrated to [[CP-67]], MTS ([[Michigan Terminal System]]), TSO ([[Time Sharing Option]] for OS/360), or one of several other [[time-sharing]] systems.\n\nCP-67, the original [[virtual machine]] system, was also known as [[CP/CMS]]. CP/67 was developed outside the IBM mainstream at IBM's [[Cambridge Scientific Center]], in cooperation with [[MIT]] researchers. CP/CMS eventually won wide acceptance, and led to the development of [[VM/370]] (Virtual Machine) which had a primary interactive \"sub\" operating system known as [[VM/CMS]] (Conversational Monitoring System). This evolved into today's [[z/VM]].\n\nThe Model 20 offered a simplified and rarely used tape-based system called TPS (Tape Processing System), and DPS (Disk Processing System) that provided support for the 2311 disk drive. TPS could run on a machine with 8&nbsp;KB of memory; DPS required 12&nbsp;KB, which was pretty hefty for a Model 20. Many customers ran quite happily with 4&nbsp;KB and CPS (Card Processing System). With TPS and DPS, the card reader was used to read the [[Job Control Language]] cards that defined the stack of jobs to run and to read in transaction data such as customer payments. The operating system was held on tape or disk, and results could also be stored on the tapes or hard drives. Stacked job processing became an exciting possibility for the small but adventurous computer user.\n\nA little-known and little-used suite of 80-column punched-card utility programs known as [[IBM Basic Programming Support|Basic Programming Support]] (BPS) (jocularly: Barely Programming Support), a precursor of TOS, was available for smaller systems.\n\n==Component names==\nIBM created a new naming system for the new components created for System/360, although well-known old names, like [[IBM 1403]] and [[IBM 1050|IBM 1052]], were retained. In this new naming system, components were given four-digit numbers starting with 2. The second digit described the type of component, as follows:\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" scope=\"row\"\n| style=\"padding-left: 2em\" | 20xx: || Arithmetic processors, for example the [[IBM 2030]], which was the CPU for the [[IBM System/360 Model 30]].\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" scope=\"row\"\n| style=\"padding-left: 2em\" | 21xx: || Power supplies and other equipment intimately associated with processors, for example the [[IBM 2167 Configuration Unit]].\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" scope=\"row\"\n| style=\"padding-left: 2em\" | 22xx: || Visual output devices, for example the [[IBM 2250]] and [[IBM 2260]] CRT displays, and the [[IBM 2203]] line printer for the System/360 model 20.\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" scope=\"row\"\n| style=\"padding-left: 2em\" | 23xx: || Direct-access storage devices, for example the [[IBM 2311]] and [[IBM 2314]] disk drives, the [[IBM 2321 Data Cell]];<br />Main storage such as the [[IBM 2361 Large Capacity Storage]] (Core Storage, Large Core Storage or LCS) and the [[IBM 2365 Processor Storage]].\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" scope=\"row\"\n| style=\"padding-left: 2em\" | 24xx: || [[Magnetic tape drive]]s, for example the [[IBM 2401]], [[IBM 2405]] and [[IBM 2415]].\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" scope=\"row\"\n| style=\"padding-left: 2em\" | 25xx: || Punched card handling equipment, for example the [[IBM 2501]] ([[punched card|card reader]]), [[IBM 2520]] (card punch); [[IBM 2540]] (reader/punch) and [[IBM 2560]] (Multi-Function Card Machine or MFCM).\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" scope=\"row\"\n| style=\"padding-left: 2em\" | 26xx: || [[Paper tape]] handling equipment, for example the [[IBM 2671]] paper tape reader.\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" scope=\"row\"\n| style=\"padding-left: 2em\" | 27xx: || Communications equipment, for example the [[IBM 2701]], [[IBM 2705]], [[IBM 2741]] interactive terminal and the [[IBM 2780]] batch terminal.\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" scope=\"row\"\n| style=\"padding-left: 2em\" | 28xx: || Channels and controllers, for example the [[IBM 2821 Control Unit]], [[IBM 2841]] and [[IBM 2844]].\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" scope=\"row\"\n| style=\"padding-left: 2em\" | 29xx: || Miscellaneous devices, for example the [[IBM 2914 Data Channel Switch]] and the [[IBM 2944 Data Channel Repeater]].\n|}\n\n==Peripherals==\nIBM developed a new family of peripheral equipment for System/360, carrying over a few from its older 1400 series. Interfaces were standardized, allowing greater flexibility to mix and match processors, controllers and peripherals than in the earlier product lines.\n\nIn addition, System/360 computers could use certain peripherals that were originally developed for earlier computers. These earlier peripherals used a different numbering system, such as the [[IBM 1403]] chain printer. The 1403, an extremely reliable device that had already earned a reputation as a workhorse, was sold as the 1403-N1 when adapted for the System/360.\n\nAlso available were [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) readers IBM 1287 and IBM 1288 which could read Alpha Numeric (A/N) and Numeric Hand Printed (NHP/NHW) Characters from Cashier's rolls of tape to full legal size pages.

This device had up to eight usable disk drives with an integral control unit; there were nine drives, but one was reserved as a spare. Each drive used a removable [[IBM 2316|2316]] disk pack with a capacity of nearly 28&nbsp;MB. The disk packs for the 2311 and 2314 were ''physically'' large by today's standards — e.g., the [[IBM 1316|1316]] disk pack was about {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter and had six platters stacked on a central spindle. The top and bottom outside platters did not store data. Data were recorded on the inner sides of the top and bottom platters and both sides of the inner platters, providing 10 recording surfaces. The 10 read/write heads moved together across the surfaces of the platters, which were formatted with 203 concentric tracks. To reduce the amount of head movement (seeking), data was written in a virtual cylinder from inside top platter down to inside bottom platter. These disks were not usually formatted with fixed-sized sectors as are today's hard drives (though this ''was'' done with [[CP/CMS]]). Rather, most System/360 I/O software could customize the length of the data record (variable-length records), as was the case with magnetic tapes.\n\n[[File:IBM 2314 DiskDrives and IBM 2540 CardReader Punch.jpg|thumb|IBM 2314 disk drives and IBM 2540 card reader/punch at the University of Michigan]]\n\n{{Anchor|IBM2301}}Some of the most powerful early System/360s used high-speed head-per-track drum storage devices.

A typical use was overlay linkage (e.g. for OS and application subroutines) for program sections written to alternate in the same memory regions. Fixed head disks and drums were particularly effective as paging devices on the early virtual memory systems. The 2305, although often called a \"drum\" was actually a head-per-track disk device, with 12 recording surfaces and a data transfer rate up to 3&nbsp;MB per second.\n\nRarely seen was the [[IBM 2321 Data Cell]],<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/datacell.html The IBM 2321 Data Cell Drive], Columbia University Computing History</ref> a mechanically complex device that contained multiple magnetic strips to hold data; strips could be randomly accessed, placed upon a cylinder-shaped drum for read/write operations; then returned to an internal storage cartridge. The IBM Data Cell [noodle picker] was among several IBM trademarked \"speedy\" mass online direct-access storage peripherals (reincarnated in recent years as \"virtual tape\" and automated tape librarian peripherals). The 2321 file had a capacity of 400&nbsp;MB, at the time when the 2311 disk drive only had 7.2&nbsp;MB. The IBM Data Cell was proposed to fill cost/capacity/speed gap between magnetic tapes—which had high capacity with relatively low cost per stored byte—and disks, which had higher expense per byte. Some installations also found the electromechanical operation less dependable and opted for less mechanical forms of direct-access storage.\n\nThe Model 44 was unique in offering an integrated single-disk drive as a standard feature.

It was notorious for reliability problems (earning humorous acronyms often involving \"...Card Muncher\" or \"Mal-Function Card Machine\").\n* [[Line printer]]s were the [[IBM 1403]] and the slower [[IBM 1443]].\n* A paper tape reader, the IBM 2671, was introduced in 1964. It had a rated speed of 1,000 cps. There were also a paper tape reader and paper tape punch from an earlier era, available only as RPQs ([[Request price quotation|Request Price Quotation]]). The 1054 (reader) and 1055 (punch), which were carried forward (like the 1052 console typewriter) from the IBM 1050 Teleprocessing System. All these devices operated at a maximum of 15.5 characters per second. The paper tape punch from the IBM 1080 System was also available by RPQ, but at a prohibitively expensive price.\n* [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR) devices 1287 and later the 1288 were available on the 360's. The 1287 could read handwritten numerals, some OCR fonts, and cash register OCR paper tape reels. The 1288 'page reader' could handle up to legal size OCR font typewritten pages, as well as handwritten numerals. Both of these OCR devices employed a 'flying spot' scanning principle, with the raster scan provided by a large CRT, and the reflected light density changes were picked up by a high gain [[photomultiplier]] tube.\n* [[Magnetic ink character recognition]] (MICR) was provided by the IBM 1412 and 1419 cheque sorters, with magnetic ink printing (for cheque books) on 1445 printers (a modified 1443 that used an MICR ribbon). 1412/1419 and 1445 were mainly used by banking institutions.\n\n==Remaining machines==\nDespite having been sold or leased in very large numbers for a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] system of its era, only a few of System/360 computers remain—mainly as non-operating property of museums or collectors. Examples of existing systems include:\n* The [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]], has a non-working [[IBM System/360 Model 30|Model 30]] on display, as do the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, and the [[Vienna University of Technology]] in Austria.\n* The [[University of Western Australia]] Computer Club has a complete [[IBM System/360 Model 40|Model 40]] in storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucc.asn.au/machines/ben.ucc|title=University Computer Club}}</ref>\n* The KCG Computer Museum of Kyoto Computer Gakuin, Japan's first computer school in town,{{clarification needed|date=November 2022}} has an IBM System/360 Model 40 on display.<ref>[http://www.kcg.ac.jp/museum/computer/mainframe_computers/ibm.html Large and Midsized Computers at KCG Computer Museum] (in Japanese) and [http://www.kcg.ac.jp/museum/en/computer/index.html KCG Computer Museum]</ref>\n* Two [[IBM System/360 Model 20]] processors along with numerous peripherals (forming two complete systems) located in [[Nuremberg, Germany]], were purchased on [[eBay]] in April/May 2019 for €3,710 by two UK enthusiasts, Adam Bradley and Chris Blackburn, who, over the course of some months, moved the machine to [[Creslow Park]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], United Kingdom. The system was in a small, abandoned building left untouched for decades, and apparently had been used in that building since all peripherals were still fully wired and interconnected. The systems are now in a dedicated machine room, and are undergoing restoration in preparation for public display in the future.<ref name=\"ibms360\">{{cite web|url=https://ibms360.co.uk/?page_id=22|title=IBM 360 MODEL 20 RESCUE AND RESTORATION|access-date=2019-05-20|year=2019}}</ref>\n* The [[Living Computers: Museum + Labs]] has a 360 model 30.\nA running list of remaining System/360s that are more than just 'front panels' can be found at [http://www.ibmsystem3.nl/System360/ World Inventory of remaining System/360 CPUs].\n\n==Gallery==\nThis gallery shows the operator's [[System console|console]], with [[processor register|register value]] lamps, [[toggle switch]]es (middle of pictures), and \"[[Big Red Switch|emergency pull]]\" switch (upper right of pictures) of the various models.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:IBM System 360-30 front panel.agr.jpg|Model 30\nFile:Museum of Science, Boston, MA - IMG 3166.JPG|Model 40\nFile:IBM 360-44.5.jpg|Model 44\nFile:IBM system 360-50 console - MfK Bern.jpg|Model 50\nFile:Console, IBM System 360 Model 65.jpg|Model 65\nFile:IBM360-67AtUmichWithMikeAlexander.jpg|Model 67\nFile:Supercomputer NSA-IBM360 85.jpg|Model 85\nFile:IBM System 36091.sj.jpg|Model 91\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of IBM]]\n* [[List of IBM products]]\n* [[IBM System/4 Pi]]\n* [[Gerrit Blaauw]]\n* [[Bob O.
