It depicts the events leading up to the brutal murder of a New York City housewife (Dickinson) before following a prostitute (Allen) who witnesses the crime, and her attempts to solve it with the help of the victim's son ([[Keith Gordon]]). It contains several direct references to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.\n\nReleased in July 1980, ''Dressed to Kill'' was a box office success in the United States, grossing over $30 million. It received largely favorable reviews, and critic [[David Denby]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine proclaimed it \"the first great American movie of the '80s\".{{sfn|Knapp|2003|p=62}} Despite its critical acclaim, the film was met with disapproval by several feminist organizations in the United States, who criticized its representations of [[transgender]] people and [[violence against women]]. Dickinson won the [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for her performance. Allen received both a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for New Star of the Year,<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.goldenglobes.com/film/dressed-kill| title = Golden Globes}}</ref> as well as an inaugural first-year [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] for Worst Actress.\n\n==Plot==\nSexually frustrated housewife Kate Miller is attending therapy sessions with New York City psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott. During an appointment, Kate attempts to seduce him, but Elliott rejects her advances, stating his unwillingness to jeopardize his happy marriage. Kate has planned to spend the day with her teenaged son Peter, an inventor, but he has to cancel as he has reached a critical point in his research, for his entry to the city's science fair. Thus, Kate goes alone to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] where she unexpectedly flirts with a mysterious stranger. Kate and the stranger stalk each other through the museum until they finally wind up outside, where Kate joins him in a taxi. They go to his apartment and have sex.\n\nHours later, Kate awakens and decides to discreetly leave while the man, Warren Lockman, is asleep. Kate sits at his desk to leave him a note and finds a document indicating that Warren has contracted both syphilis and gonorrhea. Shocked, she leaves the apartment, but having hastily forgotten her wedding ring on the nightstand, she returns to retrieve it. The elevator doors open on the figure of a tall, blonde woman in dark sunglasses wielding a straight razor, who violently slashes Kate to death in the elevator. Upon discovering the body, Liz Blake, a high-priced call girl, notices the killer in the elevator's [[Curved mirror|convex mirror]], and subsequently becomes both the prime suspect and the killer's next target.\n\nDr. Elliott receives a bizarre message on his answering machine from \"Bobbi\", a transgender patient. Bobbi taunts the psychiatrist for ending their therapy sessions, apparently because Elliott refuses to sign the necessary papers for Bobbi to get [[sex reassignment surgery]]. Elliott tries to convince Dr. Levy, the patient's new doctor, that Bobbi is endangering herself and others.\n\nPolice Detective Marino doubts Liz's story, partly because of her profession, so Liz partners with a revenge-minded Peter to find the killer, using a series of his homemade listening devices and time-lapse cameras to track patients leaving Elliott's office. They catch Bobbi on camera, and soon a tall blonde in sunglasses starts stalking Liz, subsequently making several attempts on her life. Peter thwarts one of them in the New York City Subway by spraying Bobbi with homemade Mace.\n\nThe pair scheme to learn Bobbi's birth name by infiltrating Dr. Elliott's office. Liz baits the therapist by stripping to lingerie and flirting with him, distracting him long enough to briefly exit and look through his appointment book. Peter is watching through the window when a blonde pulls him away. When Liz returns, a razor-wielding blonde confronts her; the blonde outside shoots and wounds the blonde inside, knocking the wig off and revealing the razor-wielding blonde as Dr. Elliott/Bobbi. The blonde who shot Bobbi is actually a female police officer, revealing herself to be the blonde who has been trailing Liz.\n\nElliott is arrested and [[psychiatric hospital | committed to a mental institution]]. Dr. Levy explains later to Liz that Elliott wanted to be a woman, but his male side would not allow him to proceed with the operation. Whenever a woman sexually aroused Elliott, Bobbi, representing the unstable, female side of the doctor's personality, became threatened to the point that she finally became murderous. When Dr. Levy realized this through his last conversation with Elliott, he called the police, who went to work and eventually apprehended Elliott.\n\nIn a final sequence, Elliott escapes from the asylum after strangling a nurse, stalks Liz to Peter's house, and slashes her throat. She wakes up screaming and Peter rushes to her side, letting her realize it was just a nightmare.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Dr. Robert Elliott\n* [[Angie Dickinson]] as Kate Miller\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Liz Blake\n* [[Keith Gordon]] as Peter Miller\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Detective Marino\n* [[David Margulies]] as Dr. Levy\n* Susanna Clemm as Betty Luce\n* Ken Baker as Warren Lockman\n* [[Brandon Maggart]] as Cleveland Sam\n* [[Anneka Di Lorenzo]] as nurse\n* [[Bill Randolph]] as cabbie\n* [[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]] as voice of \"Bobbi\" (''uncredited'')\n* Susanna Clemm as on-screen \"Bobbi\" (''uncredited'')\n* [[Mark Margolis]] as mental patient (''uncredited'')\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Casting ===\nDe Palma originally wanted Norwegian actress [[Liv Ullmann]] to play Kate Miller, but she declined because of the violence. He also approached [[Jill Clayburgh]], who was unavailable, and the role then went to Angie Dickinson. [[Sean Connery]] was offered the role of Robert Elliott and was enthusiastic about it, but declined because of previous commitments.<ref name=\"Mell2005\">{{cite book|author=Eila Mell|title=Casting Might-Have-Beens: A Film by Film Directory of Actors Considered for Roles Given to Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SqXAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA76|date=6 January 2005|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0976-8|page=76}}</ref> Connery later worked with De Palma on the 1987 Oscar-winning adaptation of ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]''.\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:PhiladelphiaMuseumOfArt2017.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].]]\n''Dressed to Kill'' was shot primarily in [[New York City]], though the art gallery scene was filmed at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

The unrated version is around 30 seconds longer and shows more pubic hair in the shower scene, more blood in the elevator scene (including a close-up shot of the killer slitting Kate's throat), and more explicit dialogue from Liz during the scene in Elliott's office.
