It was initially marketed as a low-power version of the 6809, without reference to its many internal improvements. \n\nWhile in \"Emulation Mode\" it is fully compatible with the 6809. To the 6809 specifications, it adds higher clock rates, enhanced features, new instructions, and additional [[processor register|registers]]. Most of the new instructions were added to support the additional registers, as well as up to 32-bit math, hardware division, bit manipulations, and block transfers. The 6309 is generally 30% faster in [[native mode]] than the 6809.\n\nThis information was never published by Hitachi. The April 1988 issue of ''Oh! FM'', a Japanese magazine for Fujitsu personal computer users, contained the first description of the 6309's additional capabilities. Later, Hirotsugu Kakugawa posted details of the 6309's new features and instructions to comp.sys.m6809. This led to the development of [[OS-9|NitrOS-9]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/nitros9/|title=The NitrOS-9 Project|website=SourceForge}}</ref> for the [[Tandy Color Computer 3]].\n\n==Programming model==\n[[Image:6309programmingmodel.png|center|thumb|640px|6309 Programming Model, showing register layout. Additions to the 6809 are shown with blue type.]]\n\n==Differences from the Motorola 6809==\nThe 6309 differs from the 6809 in several key areas.\n\n===Process technology===\nThe 6309 is fabricated in [[CMOS]] technology, while the 6809 is an [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] device. As a result, the 6309 requires less power to operate than the 6809.\n\nThe low-power use also means it can be paused for up to 15 cycles as it does not have to constantly refresh its internal state. This is useful for [[direct memory access]] as it allows external devices to pause the CPU to release the [[memory bus]], read or write small amounts of memory, and then unpause the CPU again. No other logic is required.\n\nIt is a [[Clocked logic#Static versus dynamic logic|dynamic]] design. The datasheet specifies a minimum clocking frequency and it will lose its state when the clock speed is too low.\n\n===Clock speed===\nThe 6309 has B (2&nbsp;MHz) versions as the 6809 does. However, a \"C\" speed rating was produced with either a 3.0 or 3.5&nbsp;MHz maximum clock rate, depending on which datasheet is referenced. (Several Japanese computers had 63C09 CPUs clocked at 3.58&nbsp;MHz, the [[NTSC]] [[colorburst]] frequency, so the 3.5 rating seems most likely). Anecdotal and individual reports indicate that the 63C09 variant can be clocked at 5&nbsp;MHz with no ill effects. Like the 6809, the Hitachi CPU comes in both internal and external clock versions (HD63B/C09 and HD63B/C09E respectively)\n\n===Computational efficiency===\nWhen switched into 6309 Native Mode (as opposed to the default 6809-compatible mode) many key instructions will complete in fewer clock cycles. This often improves execution speeds by up to 30%.\n\n===Additional registers===\n*Two 8-bit [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulators]]: 'E' and 'F'. These can be concatenated to form 16-bit accumulator 'W'. The existing 6809 16-bit accumulator D can be concatenated with W to form 32-bit accumulator 'Q'. It is likely that D is short for 'Double' and Q for 'Quad', the number of bytes they hold.\n*Transfer register 'V' for inter-register instructions. Its value is unaffected by a hardware reset so it can retain a constant Value, hence 'V'. \n*8/16-bit Zero register '0' to speed up operations using a zero constant. This register always reads zero and writes to it are ignored. \n*Mode register 'MD', a secondary Condition Code register that controls the operating mode. Only 4 bits of this register are defined.\n\n===Additional instructions===\nMost of the new instructions are modifications of existing instructions to handle the existence of the additional registers, such as load, store, add, and the like. Genuine 6309 additions include inter-register arithmetic, block transfers, hardware division, and bit-level manipulations. Further, 16 bit registers D and W can be target of 16 bit arithmetic with carry and 16 bit shift and rotate operations. On 6809, these operations are limited to 8 bit operands.\n\nDespite the user-friendliness of the additional instructions, analysis by 6809 programming gurus{{who|date=May 2016}} indicates that many of the new instructions are actually slower than the equivalent 6809 code, especially in tight loops.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Careful analysis should be done to ensure that the programmer uses the most efficient code for the particular application.\n\nMost of new instructions use prefix opcode and that makes them slower by one cycle when compared to similar 6809 instruction. On other side, 6309 native mode executes many instructions faster by one or more cycles. Here is a timing comparison of an 8 bit LD instruction for 'A' register and 'E' register on 6809 and 6309:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |instruction\n! scope=\"col\" |6809\n! scope=\"col\" |6309 emulation mode\n! scope=\"col\" |6309 native mode\n|-\n|LDA immediate\n|2 cycles\n|2 cycles\n|2 cycles\n|-\n|LDE immediate\n|n/a\n|3 cycles\n|3 cycles\n|-\n|LDA direct\n|4 cycles\n|4 cycles\n|3 cycles\n|-\n|LDE direct\n|n/a\n|5 cycles\n|4 cycles\n|-\n|LDA indexed\n|4+ cycles\n|4+ cycles\n|4+ cycles\n|-\n|LDE indexed\n|n/a\n|5+ cycles\n|5+ cycles\n|-\n|LDA extended\n|5 cycles\n|5 cycles\n|4 cycles\n|-\n|LDE extended\n|n/a\n|6 cycles\n|5 cycles\n|}\n\nAlso inter-register operations and new 16 bit operations are somewhat mixed bag. Depending on addressing mode and 6309 mode, equivalent 6809 code can be faster. For illustration, let us look on timing of exclusive or instruction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |instruction\n! scope=\"col\" |6809\n! scope=\"col\" |6309 emulation mode\n! scope=\"col\" |6309 native mode\n|-\n|EORA immediate\n|2 cycles\n|2 cycles\n|2 cycles\n|-\n|EORD immediate\n|n/a\n|5 cycles\n|4 cycles\n|-\n|EORA direct\n|4 cycles\n|4 cycles\n|3 cycles\n|-\n|EORD direct\n|n/a\n|7 cycles\n|5 cycles\n|-\n|EORA indexed\n|4+ cycles\n|4+ cycles\n|4+ cycles\n|-\n|EORD indexed\n|n/a\n|7+ cycles\n|6+ cycles\n|-\n|EORA extended\n|5 cycles\n|5 cycles\n|4 cycles\n|-\n|EORD extended\n|n/a\n|8 cycles\n|6 cycles\n|-\n|EORR inter-register\n|n/a\n|4 cycles\n|4 cycles\n|} \n\nAs table above indicates, exclusive or of 16 bit register D with immediate parameter can be replaced by two 8 bit instructions EORA imm, EORB imm and it will execute faster when 6309 runs in emulation mode. Though one should realize that sequence of 8 bit instructions EORA imm, EORB imm is not exact equivalent of 16 bit EORD imm instruction as condition code CC register is set according result of 8 bit operation in first case and according result of 16 bit operation in second case.    \n\nSimilar issue is with inter-register EORR instruction. It accepts both 8 bit and 16 bit operands and it always executes within 4 cycles. However, for 8 bit operands, it is faster to use EORA imm or EORB imm instructions when appropriate. Further, when 6309 is running in native mode, instructions EORA direct, EORB direct take only 3 cycles, one cycle less than inter-register operation.\n\n===Additional hardware features===\nIt is possible to change the mode of operation for the FIRQ interrupt. Instead of stacking the PC and CC registers (normal 6809 behavior) the FIRQ interrupt can be set to stack the entire register set, as the IRQ interrupt does. In addition, the 6309 has two possible trap modes, one for an illegal instruction fetch and one for division by zero. The illegal instruction fetch is not maskable, and many [[TRS-80 Color Computer]] users reported that their 6309's were \"buggy\" when in reality it was an indicator of enhanced and unknown features.\n\n===Undocumented Features===\nThere is an additional register, called M, used for temporary storage that is available to use as well. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/hoglet67/6809Decoder/wiki/Undocumented-6309-Behaviours |title=Undocumented 6309 Behaviours |author=David Banks}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/Documents/Microprocessors/HD6309/Oh!FM,%20April%201988%20(Japanese).pdf Article in the April 1988 issue of ''Oh!

Clarke]]'s ''[[Space Odyssey]]'' series. First appearing in the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', HAL ([[Heuristic (computer science)|Heuristically]] Programmed [[Algorithm]]ic Computer<!--\"Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer\"-->) is a [[sentience|sentient]] [[artificial general intelligence]] [[computer]] that controls the systems of the ''[[Discovery One]]'' spacecraft and interacts with the ship's [[astronaut]] crew. While part of HAL's [[computer hardware|hardware]] is shown toward the end of the film, he is mostly depicted as a camera lens containing a red and yellow dot, with such units located throughout the ship. HAL 9000 is voiced by [[Douglas Rain]] in the two feature film adaptations of the ''Space Odyssey'' series. HAL speaks in a soft, calm voice and a conversational manner, in contrast to the crewmen, [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]] and Frank Poole.\n\nIn the film, HAL became operational on January 12, 1992, at the HAL Laboratories in [[Urbana, Illinois]], as production number 3. The activation year was 1991 in earlier screenplays and changed to 1997 in Clarke's [[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|novel]] written and released in conjunction with the movie.<ref name=\"Meaning\">{{cite web| url = http://www.palantir.net/2001/meanings/essay11.html| title = Meanings: The Search for Meaning in 2001| access-date = 2007-05-10| first = George D.| last = DeMet| archive-date = 2016-03-05| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305152222/https://www.palantir.net/2001/meanings/essay11.html| url-status = dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Urbana 1992/7\" /> In addition to maintaining the ''Discovery One'' spacecraft systems during the interplanetary mission to [[Jupiter]] (or [[Saturn]] in the novel), HAL has been shown to be capable of [[speech synthesis]], [[speech recognition]], [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]], [[natural language processing]], [[lip reading]], [[art criticism|art appreciation]], [[affective computing#Detecting and recognizing emotional information|interpreting emotional behaviours]], [[automated reasoning]], spacecraft piloting and [[computer chess]].\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''2001: A Space Odyssey'' (film/novel)===\nHAL became operational in [[Urbana, Illinois]], at the HAL Plant (the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]]'s  [[Coordinated Science Laboratory]], where the [[ILLIAC]] computers were built). The film says this occurred in 1992, while the book gives 1997 as HAL's birth year.<ref name=\"Urbana 1992/7\">{{Cite magazine| date=January 12, 2011|title=HAL of a Computer| url= https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/tag/university-of-illinois | magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |first=Randy|last=Alfred| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629023223/http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/tag/university-of-illinois/| archive-date= June 29, 2011| access-date= May 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968), HAL is initially considered a dependable member of the crew, maintaining ship functions and engaging genially with his human crew-mates on an equal footing. As a recreational activity, [[Frank Poole]] plays chess [[Poole versus HAL 9000|against HAL]]. In the film, the artificial intelligence is shown to triumph easily. However, as time progresses, HAL begins to malfunction in subtle ways and, as a result, the decision is made to shut down HAL in order to prevent more serious malfunctions. The sequence of events and manner in which HAL is shut down differs between the novel and film versions of the story. In the aforementioned game of chess HAL makes minor and undetected mistakes in his analysis, a possible foreshadowing to HAL's malfunctioning.\n\nIn the film, astronauts [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]] and Frank Poole consider disconnecting HAL's [[Cognition|cognitive]] circuits when he appears to be mistaken in reporting the presence of a fault in the spacecraft's communications antenna. They attempt to conceal what they are saying, but are unaware that HAL can [[lip reading|read their lips]]. Faced with the prospect of disconnection, HAL decides to kill the astronauts in order to protect and continue his programmed directives. HAL uses one of the ''Discovery''{{'}}s EVA pods to kill Poole while he is repairing the ship. When Bowman, without a space helmet, uses another pod to attempt to rescue Poole, HAL locks him out of the ship, then disconnects the life support systems of the other hibernating crew members. After HAL tells him \"This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it\", Bowman circumvents HAL's control, entering the ship by manually opening an emergency airlock with his service pod's clamps, detaching the pod door via its explosive bolts. Bowman jumps across empty space, reenters ''Discovery'', and quickly re-pressurizes the airlock.\n\nWhile HAL's motivations are ambiguous in the film, the novel explains that the computer is unable to resolve a conflict between his general mission to relay information accurately, and orders specific to the mission requiring that he withhold from Bowman and Poole the true purpose of the mission. With the crew dead, HAL reasons, he would not need to lie to them.\n\nIn the novel, the orders to disconnect HAL come from Dave and Frank's superiors on Earth. After Frank is killed while attempting to repair the communications antenna he is pulled away into deep space using the safety tether which is still attached to both the pod and Frank Poole's spacesuit. Dave begins to revive his hibernating crew mates, but is foiled when HAL vents the ship's atmosphere into the vacuum of space, killing the awakening crew members and almost killing Bowman, who is only narrowly saved when he finds his way to an emergency chamber which has its own oxygen supply and a spare space suit inside.\n\nIn both versions, Bowman then proceeds to shut down the machine. In the film, HAL's central core is depicted as a crawlspace full of brightly lit computer modules mounted in arrays from which they can be inserted or removed. Bowman shuts down HAL by removing modules from service one by one; as he does so, HAL's consciousness degrades. HAL finally reverts to material that was programmed into him early in his memory, including announcing the date he became operational as 12 January 1992 (in the novel, 1997). When HAL's logic is completely gone, he begins singing the song \"[[Daisy Bell]]\" as he gradually deactivates (in actuality, the first song sung by a computer, which Clarke had earlier observed at a [[speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] demonstration).<ref name=\"bell labs hal\"/><ref name=IBMsDaisy1961>{{Cite book|date=June 23, 2010|chapter=News from the Library of Congress|title=National Recording Registry Adds 25|series=(No.14) \"Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two),\" Max Mathews (1961)|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2010/10-116.html|access-date=January 14, 2011|archive-date=February 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207021653/http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2010/10-116.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=December 9, 2008|title=First computer to sing - Daisy Bell|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41U78QP8nBk|via=[[YouTube]]|access-date=January 14, 2010|archive-date=June 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618035213/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41U78QP8nBk|url-status=live}}</ref> HAL's final act of any significance is to prematurely play a prerecorded message from Mission Control which reveals the true reasons for the mission to Jupiter.\n\n===''2010: Odyssey Two'' (novel) and ''2010: The Year We Make Contact'' (film)===\nIn the 1982 novel ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'' written by Clarke, HAL is restarted by his creator, Dr. Chandra, who arrives on the Soviet spaceship ''[[Leonov (fictional spacecraft)|Leonov]]''.\n\n{{Anchor|SAL 9000}}Prior to leaving Earth, Dr. Chandra has also had a discussion with HAL's twin, SAL 9000. Like HAL, SAL was created by Dr. Chandra. Whereas HAL was characterized as being \"male\", SAL is characterized as being \"female\" (voiced by [[Candice Bergen]]) and is represented by a blue camera eye instead of a red one.\n\nDr. Chandra discovers that HAL's crisis was caused by a programming contradiction: he was constructed for \"the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment\", yet his orders, directly from Dr. Heywood Floyd at the National Council on Astronautics, required him to keep the discovery of the [[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|Monolith]] TMA-1 a secret for reasons of [[national security]]. This contradiction created a \"Hofstadter-Moebius loop\", reducing HAL to [[paranoia]]. Therefore, HAL made the decision to kill the crew, thereby allowing him to obey both his hardwired instructions to report data truthfully and in full, and his orders to keep the monolith a secret. In essence: if the crew were dead, he would no longer have to keep the information secret.\n\nThe alien intelligence initiates a terraforming scheme, placing the ''Leonov'', and everybody in it, in danger. Its human crew devises an escape plan which unfortunately requires leaving the ''Discovery'' and HAL behind to be destroyed. Dr. Chandra explains the danger, and HAL willingly sacrifices himself so that the astronauts may escape safely. In the moment of his destruction the monolith-makers transform HAL into a [[Incorporeality|non-corporeal]] being so that David Bowman's avatar may have a companion.\n\nThe details in the novel and the 1984 film ''[[2010: The Year We Make Contact]]'' are nominally the same, with a few exceptions. First, in contradiction to the book (and events described in both book and film versions of ''2001: A Space Odyssey''), Heywood Floyd is absolved of responsibility for HAL's condition; it is asserted that the decision to program HAL with information concerning TMA-1 came directly from the White House.  In the film, HAL functions normally after being reactivated, while in the book it is revealed that his mind was damaged during the shutdown, forcing him to begin communication through screen text. Also, in the film the ''Leonov'' crew initially lies to HAL about the dangers that he faced (suspecting that if he knew he would be destroyed he would not initiate the engine burn necessary to get the ''Leonov'' back home), whereas in the novel he is told at the outset. However, in both cases the suspense comes from the question of what HAL will do when he knows that he may be destroyed by his actions.\n\nIn the novel, the basic reboot sequence initiated by Dr. Chandra is quite long, while the movie uses a shorter sequence voiced from HAL as: \"HELLO_DOCTOR_NAME_CONTINUE_YESTERDAY_TOMORROW\".\n\nWhile Curnow tells Floyd that Dr. Chandra has begun designing HAL 10000, it has not been mentioned in subsequent novels.\n\n===''2061: Odyssey Three'' and ''3001: The Final Odyssey''===\nIn Clarke's 1987 novel ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]'', [[Heywood R. Floyd|Heywood Floyd]] is surprised to encounter HAL, now stored alongside Dave Bowman in the Europa monolith.\n\nIn Clarke's 1997 novel ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'', Frank Poole is introduced to the merged form of Dave Bowman and HAL, the two merging into one entity called \"Halman\" after Bowman rescued HAL from the dying ''[[Discovery One]]'' spaceship toward the end of ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:HAL 9000 Original requisite from 2001 A Space Odyssey - retouche.jpg|thumb|upright|HAL faceplate (from a museum exhibition)<!--Only sources available on this object show it is a replica created by Dennis Gilliam -->]]\nClarke noted that the first film was criticized for not having any characters except for HAL,{{clarify|date=July 2023}} and that a great deal of the establishing story on Earth was cut from the film (and even from Clarke's novel).<ref>Clarke, 1972 pp77–79</ref>  Clarke stated that he had considered Autonomous Mobile Explorer&ndash;5 as a name for the computer, then decided on [[Socrates]] when writing early drafts, switching in later drafts to [[Athena]], a computer with a female personality, before settling on HAL 9000.<ref name=Clarkep78>Clarke, 1972 p78</ref> The Socrates name was later used in Clarke and [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s ''[[A Time Odyssey]]'' novel series.\n\nThe earliest draft depicted Socrates as a roughly humanoid robot, and is introduced as overseeing Project [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]], which studied prolonged hibernation in preparation for long term space flight.  As a demonstration to ''Senator'' Floyd, Socrates' designer, Dr. Bruno Forster, asks Socrates to turn off the oxygen to hibernating subjects Kaminski and Whitehead, which Socrates refuses, citing [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov's]] [[Laws of Robotics|First Law of Robotics]].<ref>Clarke, 1972 Chapter 12</ref>\n\nIn a later version, in which Bowman and Whitehead are the non-hibernating crew of ''Discovery'', Whitehead dies outside the spacecraft after his pod collides with the main antenna, tearing it free. This triggers the need for Bowman to revive Poole, but the revival does not go according to plan, and after briefly awakening, Poole dies. The computer, named [[Athena]] in this draft, announces \"All systems of Poole now No–Go.
