Designed to simulate [[bass guitar]]s, it was a commercial failure and was discontinued in 1984. However, cheap second-hand units were adopted by electronic musicians, and its \"squelching\" or \"chirping\" sound became a foundation of [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[acid house]], [[Chicago house]] and [[techno]]. It has inspired numerous [[Synthesiser clone|clones]].\n\n==Design and features==\n\nThe TB-303 was manufactured by the Japanese company [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]. It was designed by [[Tadao Kikumoto]], who also designed the [[Roland TR-909]] drum machine.<ref name=\"emusician\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.emusician.com/gear/tadao-kikumoto|title=Electronic Musician: Tadao Kikumoto|last=Hsieh|first=Christine|date=|website=Emusician.com|access-date=2010-10-02}}</ref> It was marketed as a \"computerised bass machine\" to replace the [[bass guitar]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Reid |first=Gordon |date=December 2004 |title=The History Of Roland: Part 2 |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/history-roland-part-2 |access-date=2018-03-26 |website=[[Sound on Sound]] |language=en-gb}}</ref> However, according to ''[[Forbes]],'' it instead produces a \"squelchy tone more reminiscent of a psychedelic [[Jew's harp|mouth harp]] than a stringed instrument\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe TB-303 has a single [[Voltage-controlled oscillator|oscillator]], which produces either a \"buzzy\" [[sawtooth wave]] or a \"hollow-sounding\" [[square wave]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasperhamill/2014/03/25/one-synth-to-rule-them-all-roland-takes-on-clones-with-reissue-of-legendary-tb-303/#346a468359d5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329023727/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasperhamill/2014/03/25/one-synth-to-rule-them-all-roland-takes-on-clones-with-reissue-of-legendary-tb-303/#346a468359d5|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 March 2014|title=The world's most famous electronic instrument is back.

The album remained obscure until the early 21st century, and is now recognized as a precursor to [[acid house]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/10/charanjit-singh-acid-house-ten-ragas|title=Charanjit Singh on how he invented acid house ... by mistake|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Stuart Aitken|date=10 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Chicago group [[Phuture]] bought a cheap TB-303 and began experimenting. By manipulating the synthesizer as it played, they created a unique \"squelching, resonant and liquid sound\". This became the foundation of the single \"[[Phuture|Acid Tracks]]\", which was released in 1987 and created the acid genre. Acid, with the TB-303 as a staple sound, became popular worldwide, particularly as part of the UK's emerging [[Rave|rave culture]] known as the [[Second Summer of Love|second summer of love]].<ref
