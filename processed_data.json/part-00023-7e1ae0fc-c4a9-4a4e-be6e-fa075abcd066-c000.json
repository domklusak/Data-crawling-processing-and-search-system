It has no overall winner—although American cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] originally won the event, the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] announced in August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from [[1999 Tour de France|1999]] to [[2005 Tour de France|2005]]. The verdict was subsequently confirmed by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]].\n\nThe race included a {{convert|67|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} team time trial, two individual time trials and five consecutive mountain-top finishing stages, the second of which was the [[Chamrousse]] special-category climb time trial. Thus, all the high-mountain stages were grouped consecutively, following the climbing time trial, with one rest day in between.  France was ridden 'clockwise', so the [[Alps]] were visited before the [[Pyrenees]]. The Tour started in France but also visited Belgium in its first week. The ceremonial final stage finished at the [[Champs-Élysées]] in Paris, as is tradition. [[Erik Zabel]] won his record sixth consecutive [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] victory. This was a record for points classification victories and is still a record for most consecutive victories, however [[Peter Sagan]] now holds the record for most total [[Green Jersey|green jersey]] wins with seven.\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 2001 Tour de France}}\n\nThe organisers felt that the 2000 Tour de France had not included enough French teams and consequently changed the selection procedure.<ref name=\"teamsel\"/> {{UCI team code|USP|2001}} was selected because it included the winner of the previous edition, [[Lance Armstrong]]. {{UCI team code|TEL|2001}} was selected because it included the winner of the 2000 [[UCI Road World Cup]], [[Erik Zabel]]). {{UCI team code|MAP|2001}} was selected because it won the [[Team classification in the Giro d'Italia|team classification]] in the [[2000 Giro d'Italia]]. {{UCI team code|KEL|2001}} was selected because it won the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]]s in both the [[2000 Tour de France]] and [[2000 Vuelta a España]].

The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452–453}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], which awarded a green jersey. In this classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification and was identified with a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453–454}}\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either ''[[hors catégorie]]'', first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists to reach the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification and wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nThe fourth individual classification was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]], which was marked by the white jersey. This was decided in the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years of age were eligible.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454–455}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each [[Mass start|mass-start]] stage to the cyclist considered most combative, who wore a red number bib the next stage. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211–216}} Laurent Jalabert won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award.<ref name=\"letour-combativity-final\">{{cite web|title=Tour de France 2001 – Overall combativity standings|url=http://www.letour.com/2001/us/classements.oft?service=RaceServer&RaceType=TDF&RaceYear=2001&StageNumber=2000&Language=ANG&StandingType=ICG|work=Tour de France|publisher=[[Amaury Sport Organisation]]|access-date=4 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040503085737/http://www.letour.com/2001/us/classements.oft?service=RaceServer&RaceType=TDF&RaceYear=2001&StageNumber=2000&Language=ANG&StandingType=ICG|archive-date=3 May 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThere were also two special awards each with a prize of F 20,000,<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Jeff|title=Tour News for July 4|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/results/2001/tour01/news/jul04news.shtml|access-date=24 November 2019|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|date=4 July 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801025407/http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/results/2001/tour01/news/jul04news.shtml|archive-date=1 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> the [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]], given in honour of Tour founder and first race director [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col de la Madeleine]] on stage 10, and the [[Souvenir Jacques Goddet]], given for the first time in honour of the second director [[Jacques Goddet]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Tourmalet]] on stage 14.

Report\"/>{{rp|118}}\n\nFurther examination of the airplane structure, seats, and other interior components found no damage typically associated with a high-energy explosion of a bomb or missile warhead (\"severe pitting, cratering, petalling or hot-gas washing\").<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|258}} This included the pieces on which trace amounts of explosives were found.<ref name=\"Final

its use in a dog-training explosive-detection exercise about one month before the accident.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|258–259}} Testing conducted by the FAA's Technical Center indicated that residues of the type of explosives found on the wreckage would dissipate completely after two days of immersion in seawater (nearly all recovered wreckage was immersed longer than two days).<ref

of military personnel onto the wreckage during or after the recovery operation, and that the residue was not present when the aircraft crashed into the water.<ref name=\"Final

flight conditions showed the combination of liquid fuel and fuel-air vapor to be flammable.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}} A major reason for the flammability of the fuel-air vapor in the CWT of the 747 was the large amount of heat generated and transferred to the CWT by air-conditioning packs located directly below the tank;<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|298}} with the CWT temperature raised to a sufficient level, a single ignition source could cause an explosion.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|298}}\n\nComputer modeling<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|122–123}} and scale-model testing<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|123}} were used to predict and demonstrate how an explosion would progress in a 747 CWT. During this time, [[quenching]] was identified as an issue, a phenomenon in which the explosion would extinguish itself as it passed through the complex structure of the CWT.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|123}} Because the research data regarding quenching were limited, a complete understanding of quenching behavior was not possible, and the issue of quenching remained unresolved.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|137}}\n\nTo better determine whether a fuel-air vapor explosion in the CWT would generate sufficient pressure to break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of the airplane, tests were conducted in July and August 1997 using a retired [[Air France]] 747 at [[Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome|Bruntingthorpe Airfield]], England. These tests simulated a fuel-air explosion in the CWT by igniting a propane-air mixture, which failed the tank structure from overpressure.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}} While the NTSB acknowledged that the test conditions at Bruntingthorpe were not fully comparable to the conditions that existed on TWA 800,<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}} previous fuel explosions in the CWTs of commercial airliners such as those of [[Avianca Flight 203]] and [[Philippine Airlines Flight 143]] confirmed that a CWT explosion could break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of an airplane.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}}\n\nUltimately, based on \"the accident airplane's breakup sequence; wreckage damage characteristics; scientific tests and research on fuels, fuel tank explosions, and the conditions in the CWT at the time of the accident; and analysis of witness information,\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|271}} the NTSB concluded that \"the TWA flight 800

red area pieces (from the forward portion of the wing center section and a ring of fuselage directly in front) were the earliest pieces to separate from the airplane; (2) the forward fuselage section departed simultaneously with or shortly after the red area pieces, landing relatively intact in the yellow zone; (3) the green area pieces (wings and the aft portion of the fuselage) remained intact

the forward fuselage.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|109}} After about 34 seconds (based on information from witness documents), the outer portions of both the right and left wings failed.<ref

Air Force]] [[84th Radar Evaluation Squadron]], was capable of estimating the altitude of TWA 800 after it lost power due to the CWT explosion.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|87}} Because of accuracy limitations, these radar data could not be used to determine whether the aircraft climbed after the nose separated.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|87}} Instead, the NTSB conducted a series of computer simulations to examine the flightpath of the main portion of the fuselage.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|95–96}} Hundreds of simulations were run using various combinations of possible times the nose of TWA 800 separated (the exact time was unknown), different models of the behavior of the crippled aircraft (the aerodynamic properties of the aircraft without its nose could only be estimated), and longitudinal radar data (the recorded radar tracks of the east/west position of TWA 800 from various sites differed).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|96–97}} These simulations indicated that after the loss of the forward fuselage the remainder of the aircraft continued in crippled flight, then pitched up while rolling to the left (north),<ref name=\"Final

more fully address the accounts of witnesses.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|7}} From November 1996 through April 1997, this group reviewed summaries of witness accounts on loan from the FBI (with personal information redacted) and conducted interviews with crewmembers from a [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60]] helicopter and [[C-130]] airplane, as well as a U.S. Navy [[P-3 Orion|P-3]]

the documents.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|10}} Because of the time that had elapsed (about 21 months) before the NTSB received information about the identity of the witnesses, the witness group chose not to reinterview the witnesses, but instead to rely on the original summaries of witness statements written by FBI agents as the best available evidence of the observations initially reported by the witnesses.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|230}} Despite the two and a half years that had elapsed since the accident, the witness group did interview the captain of Eastwind Airlines Flight

suggested interview questions given to FBI agents such as \"Where was the sun in relation to the aircraft and the missile launch point?\" and \"How long did the missile fly?\" could have biased interviewees' responses in some cases.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|266}} The NTSB concluded that given the large number of witnesses in this case, they \"did not expect all of the documented witness observations to be consistent with one another\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|269}} and \"did not view these apparently anomalous witness reports as persuasive evidence that some witnesses might have observed a missile.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}}\n\nAfter missile visibility tests were conducted in April 2000, at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]],<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|254}} the NTSB determined that if witnesses had observed a missile attack, they would have seen:\n# a light from the burning missile motor ascending very rapidly and steeply for about 8 seconds\n# the light disappearing for up to 7 seconds\n# upon the missile striking the aircraft and igniting the CWT, another light, moving considerably more slowly and more laterally than the first, for about 30 seconds\n# this light descending while simultaneously developing into a fireball falling toward the ocean<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}} None of the witness documents described such a scenario.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}}\n[[File:Twa n93119 wing explosion.jpg|thumb|left|Another frame from the CIA's animation depicting how the left wing of TWA Flight 800 was shorn off and created a second fireball]]\nBecause of their unique vantage points or the level of precision and detail provided in their accounts, five witness accounts generated special interest:<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|242–243}} the pilot of Eastwind Airlines Flight 507, the crew members in the HH-60 helicopter, a streak-of-light witness aboard [[US Airways]] Flight 217, a land witness on the Beach Lane Bridge in [[Westhampton Beach, New York]] and a witness on a boat near Great Gun Beach.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|243–247}} Advocates of a missile-attack scenario asserted that some of these witnesses observed a missile;<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|264}} analysis demonstrated that the observations were not consistent with a missile attack on TWA&nbsp;800, but instead were consistent with these witnesses having observed part of the in-flight fire and breakup sequence after the CWT explosion.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|264}}\n\nThe NTSB concluded, \"the witness observations of a streak of light were not related to a missile and that the streak of light reported by most of these witnesses was burning fuel from the accident airplane in crippled flight during some portion of the postexplosion, preimpact breakup sequence\".<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}} The NTSB further concluded, \"the witnesses' observations of one or more fireballs were of the airplane's burning wreckage falling toward the ocean\".<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}}\n\n===Possible ignition sources of the center wing fuel tank===\nTo determine what ignited the flammable fuel-air vapor in the CWT and caused the explosion, the NTSB evaluated numerous potential ignition sources. All but one were considered very unlikely to have been the source of ignition.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|279}}\n\n====Missile fragment or small explosive charge====\nAlthough the NTSB had already concluded that a missile strike did not cause the structural failure of the airplane, the possibility that a missile could have exploded close enough to TWA&nbsp;800 for a missile fragment to have entered the CWT and ignited the fuel/air vapor, yet far enough away not to have left any damage characteristic of a missile strike, was considered.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|272}} Computer simulations using missile performance data simulated a missile detonating in a location such that a fragment from the warhead could penetrate the CWT.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273}} Based on these simulations, the NTSB concluded that it was \"very unlikely\" that a warhead could have detonated in such a location where a fragment could penetrate the CWT without other missile fragments impacting the surrounding airplane structure, leaving distinctive impact marks.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273}}\n\nSimilarly, the investigation considered the possibility that a small explosive charge placed on the CWT could have been the ignition source.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273}} Testing by the NTSB and the British [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] demonstrated that when the metal of the same type and thickness of the CWT was penetrated by a small charge, petalling of the surface occurred where the charge was placed, with pitting on the adjacent surfaces and visible hot-gas washing damage in the surrounding area.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273–274}} Since none of the recovered CWT wreckage exhibited these damage characteristics and none of the areas of missing wreckage was large enough to encompass all the expected damage, the investigation concluded that this scenario was \"very unlikely\".<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|274}}\n\n====Other potential sources====\nThe NTSB also investigated whether the fuel-air mixture in the CWT could have been ignited by [[lightning strike]], [[meteor strike]], [[auto ignition]] or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from another fuel tank via the vent system, an uncontained engine failure, a turbine burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT scavenger pump, or [[static electricity]].<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|272–279}} After analysis, the investigation determined that these potential sources were \"very unlikely\" to have been the source of ignition.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|279}}\n\n====Fuel quantity indication system====\nBecause a combustible fuel-air mixture will always exist in fuel tanks, Boeing designers attempted to eliminate all possible sources of ignition in the 747's tanks. To do so, all devices are protected from vapor intrusion, and voltages and currents used by the fuel quantity indication system (FQIS) are kept very low. In the case of the 747-100 series, the only wiring located inside the CWT is that associated with the FQIS.{{cn|date=July 2020}}\n\nFor the FQIS to have been Flight 800's ignition source, a transfer of higher-than-normal voltage to the FQIS would have needed to occur, as well as some mechanism whereby the excess energy was released by the FQIS wiring into the CWT. The NTSB concluded, \"the ignition energy for the CWT explosion most likely entered the CWT through the FQIS wiring.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\" />{{rp|294}}<ref>{{cite book|title=In-flight breakup over the Atlantic Ocean, Trans World Airlines Flight 800 Boeing 747-131, N93119, near East Moriches, New York, July 17, 1996|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd9rSiFtSwIC&pg=PA294|publisher=Diane Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-6207-1|pages=294–|access-date=March 10, 2021|archive-date=July 23, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210723174657/https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd9rSiFtSwIC&pg=PA294|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThough the FQIS itself was designed to prevent danger by minimizing voltages and currents, the innermost tube of Flight 800's FQIS compensator showed damage similar to that of the compensator tube identified as the ignition source for the [[Imperial Iranian Air Force Flight 48|surge tank fire that destroyed a 747 near Madrid in 1976]].<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|293–294}} This was not considered proof of a source of ignition. Evidence of arcing was found in a wire bundle that included FQIS wiring connecting to the center wing tank.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|288}} Arcing signs were also seen on two wires sharing a cable raceway with FQIS wiring at station 955.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|288}}\n\nThe captain's CVR channel showed two \"dropouts\" of background power harmonics in the second before the recording ended (with the separation of the nose).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|289}} This might well be the signature of an arc on cockpit wiring adjacent to the FQIS wiring. The captain commented on the \"crazy\" readings of the number 4 engine fuel flow gauge about 2&thinsp;1/2 minutes before the CVR recording ended.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|290}} Finally, the CWT fuel quantity gauge was recovered and indicated 640&nbsp;pounds instead of the 300&nbsp;pounds that had been loaded into that tank.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|290}} Experiments showed that applying power to a wire leading to the fuel quantity gauge can cause the digital display to change by several hundred pounds before the circuit breaker trips. Thus, the gauge anomaly could have been caused by a short to the FQIS wiring.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|290}} The NTSB concluded that the most likely source of sufficient voltage to cause ignition was a short from damaged wiring, or within electrical components of the FQIS. As not all components and wiring were recovered, pinpointing the source of the necessary voltage was not possible.\n\n==Report conclusions==\nThe NTSB investigation ended with the adoption of the board's final report on August 23, 2000. The board determined that the probable cause of the TWA 800 accident was:<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|308}}\n{{quote|[An] explosion of the center wing fuel tank (CWT), resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty, but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the CWT that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.}}\n\nIn addition to the probable cause, the NTSB found the following contributing factors to the accident:<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|308}}\n{{quote|\n* The design and certification concept that fuel tank explosions could be prevented solely by precluding all ignition sources.\n* The certification of the Boeing 747 with heat sources located beneath the CWT with no means to reduce the heat transferred into the CWT or to render the fuel tank vapor noncombustible|sign=|source=}}\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, and in its final report, the NTSB issued 15 safety recommendations, mostly covering fuel tank and wiring-related issues.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|309–312}} Among the recommendations was that significant consideration should be given to the development of modifications such as [[inerting system|nitrogen-inerting systems]] for new airplane designs, and where feasible, for existing airplanes.<ref name=\"A-96-174-177\">{{cite web|url=http://ntsb.gov/recs/letters/1996/a96_174_177.pdf|title=National Transportation Safety Board Safety Recommendation|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608081653/https://www.ntsb.gov/Recs/letters/1996/A96_174_177.pdf|archive-date=June 8, 2010|access-date=January 16, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{rp|6}}\n\n===Controversy===\n{{See also|TWA Flight 800 conspiracy theories}}\nThe NTSB's conclusions about the cause of the TWA 800 disaster took four years and one month to be published.
