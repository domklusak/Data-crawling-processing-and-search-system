Faced with criticism that this name was not very compelling, and too aggressive, the naming committee reconvened. The candidate name \"2001 Mars Odyssey\" had earlier been rejected because of copyright and trademark concerns. However, NASA e-mailed [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in Sri Lanka, who responded that he would be delighted to have the mission named after his books, and he had no objections. On September 20, NASA associate administrator [[Ed Weiler]] wrote to the associate administrator for public affairs recommending a name change from ARES to ''2001 Mars Odyssey''.
