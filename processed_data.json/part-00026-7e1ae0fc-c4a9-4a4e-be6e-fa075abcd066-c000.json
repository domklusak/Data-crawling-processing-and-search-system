Its too Anglo-US biased, and stresses track and field to the exclusion of most others, so if you actually ''enjoy'' dressage or gymnastics or archery or sailing, come and tell us about your sports Olympic heroes.\n:([[Summer Olympic Games|Read more]])\n\n'''Open Source $25,000 Award'''\n: Posted June 26\n: This is completely off topic and has nothing to do with Wikipedia articles, so 1,000,000 apologies if it is inappropriate here, but is probably of interest to y'all... My company (The Open Source Development Lab [http://www.osdlab.org osdlab.org]) is going to give an award to a free software / open source development project, and is accepting nominations starting today. ''The 2001 OSDL Enterprise Achievement Award is a cash prize of $25,000.00, which will be granted to a group or developer that has made a significant contribution to Linux for the enterprise in the last two years. Each nomination will be reviewed and a winner selected by a panel of judges based on the contribution's originality, level of innovation and level of broad-based applicability to the enterprise.'' Entries are accepted until August 10. If you know of or are a participant of a project you think is deserving, this could be a good way to get the group some war funds. ;-)\n: ([http://www.osdlab.org Read more...] \n\n'''Open source'''\n: Posted June 26\n: [[user:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]] adds more information on [[Open source]] and [[Bruce Perens]] (for whom more elaboration has been requested by Larry). This is an important topic for us, and one unlikely to be found in mainstream commercial encyclopedias. Perhaps there are essays on relevant topics out there covered under the Free Documentation License that we could rightfully incorporate?\n: ([[Open source | Read more...]] | [[Open source/Talk | Talk...]])\n\n'''Gravity'''\n: Posted June 24\n: Wikipedia's [[Gravity]] article has grown considerably, and discusses not only the academic stuff we all learned in high school, but even outlines some of the experiments going on today to help us learn more about this important force of nature. ''...The next step will be to detect the graviton, the theorized quantum particle that carries the gravitational wave (much like the photon carries the electromagnetic wave). ''\n: ([[Gravity | Read more...]] | [[Gravity/Talk | Talk...]])\n\n'''Abscess'''\n: Posted June 24\n: Anyone who has searched for medical information on the web can attest that sometimes what you really need - a plain old encyclopedic definition - is hard to find (as opposed to diagnosis and treatments). [[User:ErdemTuzun]] provides an excellent synopsis of a common kind of infection most of us have probably had at one time or another. But thank [[God]] Wikipedia doesn't support photos! ;-) Other new medical articles by Erdem and others worth checking out include [[Blue tongue disease]], [[Biological virus]], and [[Stendhal syndrome]]. Those of you wishing to contribute to this body of knowledge might want to check out the [[Infectious diseases]] page; who knows, maybe the medical information we compile will help some future doctor get through school easier and help us in turn when we're all old and suffering!\n: ([[Abscess | Read more...]] | [[Abscess/Talk | Talk...]]) \n\n'''Maurice Merleau-Ponty'''\n: Posted June 23\n: [[User:Hiram|Hiram]] provides a synopsis of the French philosopher [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], who explored subjectivity and human perception of reality and things in it. ''By a pre-conscious act of `original faith' we immediately place this phenomenal thing in the world, where it blends in with other things and behaves like any `figure' against a certain background.

''In college Brubeck was nearly expelled when one of his professors discovered that he could not read sheet music. Several of his professors came forward arguing for his ability with counterpoint and harmony, but the school was still afraid that it would cause a scandal, and only agreed to let Brubeck graduate once Brubeck promised never to teach piano. ''\n: ([[Dave Brubeck | Read more...]] | [[Dave Brubeck/Talk | Talk...]])\n\n'''Caves'''\n: Posted June 22\n: ''Caves of one sort or another are widely scattered across the planet. Caves can form in sandstone, loess, ice, granite, lava, marble, gypsum and limestone. Limestone caves are the most prevalent, but gypsum and lava caves may be locally very significant. Ice caves occur under glaciers. Caves in other types of rocks present more of an engineering hazard than an exploration challenge. '' Caves *rock*.\n: ([[Caves | Read more...]] | [[Caves/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''John Lee Hooker'''\n: Posted June 22\n: [[John Lee Hooker]], one of the greats of [[blues]] music, died yesterday. ''Rhythmically, his music was very free, a property which had been common with early acoustic Delta blues musicians. ''\n: ([[John Lee Hooker | Read more...]] | [[John Lee Hooker/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''Mathematics'''\n: Posted June 22\n: The mathematics page has received a bit of a makeover. Its topics are organized in a manner not unlike the homepage. It's interesting to note that a number of high level pages have been receiving this sort of refactoring/organizational attention, and many different schemes are being investigated.\n: ([[Mathematics | Read more...]]] | [[Mathematics/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''Philosophy'''\n: Posted June 21\n: The [[Philosophy]] main page has been updated, with new content and a new organizational scheme. [[Larry Sanger]] is immodestly proud of this work, or so he says, and thinks that it shows how other top-level pages could be rendered into a prose format. [[Biology]] is another top-level example that uses prose sentences intermixed with link lists to both introduce biology and to point the reader to specialized topics within the subject of biology.\n: ([[Philosophy | Read more...]] | [[Philosophy/Talk | Talk]])\n\n:''Halting Problem'''\n: Posted June 21\n: [[User:TedDunning]] adds a page on a concept similar in nature to the [[Incompleteness Theorem]], called the [[Halting Problem]]. ''the function that solves the halting problem can't be written down and the computing system can't be implemented.''\n: ([[Halting Problem | Read more...]] | [[Halting Problem/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''Catullus'''\n: Posted June 21\n: [[User:Xiemaisi]] biographies Caius Valerius Catullus, a famous Roman poet who greatly influenced later poets such as Ovid, Horace, and Virgil with a shockingly explicit writing style. ''...despite his seemingly frivolous lifestyle Catullus measured himself and his friends by quite ambitious standards. ''\n: ([[Catullus | Read more...]] | [[Catullus/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''Joseph Schumpeter'''\n: Posted June 21\n: [[User:Robert Vienneau]] writes: ''Joseph A. Schumpeter (1883-1950) was one of the greatest 20th century economists... Schumpeter's characterizes capitalism by the phrase \"creative destruction,\" in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Schumpeter thinks that the success of capitalism will lead to a form of corporations and a fostering of values, especially among intellectuals, of hostility to capitalism. The intellectual and social climate needed to allow entrepreneurship to thrive will not exist in advanced capitalism and it will be succeeded by socialism of some form or another.''\n: ([[Joseph Schumpeter | Read more...]] | [[Joseph Schumpeter/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''Joseph Conrad'''\n: Posted June 20\n: [[User:Sjc]] writes an informative bio of the author of the classic, \"Heart of Darkness\". Ironically, [[English language|English]] was not Joseph Conrad's native tongue. ''...it is altogether remarkable that Conrad should write so fluently and effectively in what was his third language. ''\n\n: ([[Joseph Conrad | Read more...]] | [[Joseph Conrad/Talk | Talk]])\n'''Cantonese'''\n: Posted June 20 \n: What we think of as \"Chinese\" is actually several fairly distinct dialects. One of these dialects is [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]], spoken by over 100 million people worldwide. [[User:Xiemaisi]] introduces us to this important language, offering an insightful comparison of it with [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]], another of [[China]]'s dialects. (By the way, the [[Chinese history]] page has been fleshed out a good deal over the past few days, and is worth checking out again. It's even been added to the [[wikipedia:brilliant prose|brilliant prose]] page!)\n: ([[Cantonese (linguistics)|Read more...]] | [[Cantonese/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''The Writing's on the Wall'''\n: Posted June 20\n: It is telling that [[Language]] is an area that Wikipedians appear to be fascinated by. Recent new articles under the Language theme include [[Slang]] (which needs expounding on) and [[Runic]]. Wikipedia also has an [[Artificial language]] section, with pointers to pages on several languages that were deliberately created -- we need someone to write up articles on [[Klingon]] and [[Volapuk]] to get this page filled in. 74 new additions have been made to the [[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/English_proverbs English proverbs]] list by [[User:Kpjas]]\n: ([[Language | Read more...]] | [[Language/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''Take England, Please!'''\n: Posted June 20\n: Okay, Wikipedia is nothing if not FLUSH with World War II articles. The past few days has seen particular activity on topics of [[England]] in WWII. None of these articles are quite large enough -- we need your help to fill in the details. [[Royal Air Force]] is a brief synopsis of the glorious defenders of the island, who combated the [[Luftwaffe]] (both of these need a lot of expounding on!) [[Operation Sea Lion]], a never-realized plan by the Germans to land an invasion force, has been added. [[Exeter, England|Exeter]], [[Dartmoor]], and [[Devon, England|Devon]] are entered into the tome. [[User:TimShell]] adds mention on the page about [[Jew]]s that ''Prior to World War II the world population of Jews was around 17 million. The Holocaust reduced this number to around 11 million.''\n: ([[England | Read more...]] | [[England/Talk | Talk]])\n\n:''See also :'' [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia NEWS|Wikipedia NEWS]]","_bytes":10567,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2011-09-14T07:50:06Z"},"title":"Wikipedia:Wikipedia NEWS/June 20 25 2001","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}

He used corrupt and unfortunate means to keep his [[dictatorship]].''\n: [[Winston Churchill]] ''Churchill came to the fore of British politics during the cumulation of World War Two.

''The play challenges conventional notions of property, and, to paraphrase from the play, asks the central rhetorical question: \"Who is the bigger criminal? He who robs a bank or he who founds one?\" ''\n: ([[Threepenny Opera | Read more...]] | [[Threepenny Opera/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''Bruce Sterling'''\n: Posted June 16\n: Wikipedia's [[Science fiction]] author collection grows with an article by [[User:Malcolm Farmer]] on Bruce Sterling. ''In the late 1970s onwards, Sterling wrote a series of stories set in a `Mechanist/Shaper' universe: the solar system is colonised, with two major warring factions. The Mechanists use a great deal of computer-based mechanical technologies, the Shapers do genetic engineering on a massive scale.''\n: ([[Bruce Sterling | Read more...]] | [[Bruce Sterling/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''Today in the News'''\n: [[June 15]], [[2001]]\n: [[NASA]] astronauts on the space station [[Alpha]] rehearse to fix a malfunctioning robotic arm. Worldwide controversy over the U.S. [[National Missile Defense]] system grew today, as [[China|Chinese]] President [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Russia]] President [[Vladimir Putin]] condemned the missile system during a meeting at the newly named [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO). [[FBI]] agent and convicted Russian spy [[Robert Hanssen]] is in negotiations with U.S. federal prosecuters to avoid suffering the [[death penalty]]. The anticipated ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' film is released, starring [[Angelina Jolie]] as [[Lara Croft]], and [[Noah Taylor]] as her sidekick and brilliant engineer Bryce (yay!) And [[farmer]]s in [[Zentsuji]], [[Japan]] have developed a clever technique to grow square [[watermelon]]s by inserting the melons into glass cases the exact dimension of Japanese [[refrigerator]]s; they cost four times as much as regular watermelons, though.\n: ([[June 15 | Read more...]] | [[June 15/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''Michael Moorcock'''\n: Posted June 15\n: [[User:Sjc|Sjc]] brings us knowledge of a prolific British [[Science fiction]] author, [[Michael Moorcock]], who ''is considered one of the founders of the so-called `New Wave' movement in science fiction: his serialisation of [[Norman Spinrad]]'s `Bug Jack Barron' was notorious for causing a British MP to condemn the Arts Council's funding of the magazine.'' He is author of such books as 'Universal Champion', 'Mother London' and 'Byzantium endures'.\n: ([[Michael Moorcock | Read more...]] | [[Michael Moorcock/Talk | Talk]])\n\n'''Two Chess Grandmasters'''\n: Today [[User:Isofarro]] posts two articles to introduce us to two of the grand masters of [[Chess]].\n: ''[[Anatoly Karpov]] Russian chess player who started off his playing career by annexing the Junior World Championship (not won by a Russian since [[Boris Spassky]]), everything sky-rocketed from there.

''[John] Cabot went to [[Bristol]] to make the preparations for his voyage. Bristol by then was the second-largest seaport of England, and during the past years (from [[1480]] onwards) several expeditions had been sent out to look for [[Hy-Brasil]], an island that would lay somewhere in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] according to [[Celtic]] legends.... Cabot left with only one vessel, the ''Matthew'', a small ship (50 tuns), but fast and able.

Such an epic history begins, appropriately enough, with a heroic battle: ''In the 220s BCE, the duke Zheng of Qin managed to overwhelm the state of Chu, the biggest of the Warring States. This victory impressed the other dukes so much they surrendered without further fighting. Zheng proclaimed himself First Emperor of the [[Qin Dynasty]] (Qin Shi Huangdi).

Exiled to [[Elba]] with 1,000 men, Napoleon escapes after a year and once more rallies the French to his side. King [[Louis XVIII]] flees, and the [[Hundred Days|European powers declare war once again]]. In [[Brussels]] during the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]], the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] is warned of Napoleon's march into [[Belgium]], tactically driving a wedge between the British and Prussian armies. Wellington, in consulting with his staff, elects to halt Napoleon at [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]].\n\nAt [[Battle of Quatre-Bras|Quatre-Bras]], Marshal [[Michel Ney|Ney]] fights the British to a draw, whereas Napoleon defeats the Prussians at [[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]]. Ney rides to Napoleon to deliver his report, but in doing so has allowed Wellington to withdraw his still intact forces. Napoleon commands [[Emmanuel de Grouchy, marquis de Grouchy|Grouchy]] to lead 30,000 men against the Prussians to prevent their rejoining the British, whilst Napoleon will command his remaining troops against Wellington.\n\nOn June 18, 1815, the [[Battle of Waterloo]] commences with initial cannon fire from the French. Napoleon launches teasing attacks against Wellington's flanks at [[Hougoumont]] and [[La Haye Sainte]], though Wellington refuses to divert his main force. General [[Thomas Picton|Picton]] is sent to plug a gap when a Dutch brigade is routed, and though successful he is killed in doing so. [[William Ponsonby (British Army officer)|Ponsonby]] also leads a cavalry charge against the French cannon, but becomes isolated from the main allied force and is cut down by French lancers.\n\nTroops spotted emerging from the east are worryingly assumed to be Grouchy by Wellington, and [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] to Napoleon. Suffering from stomach pain, Napoleon momentarily withdraws and leaves Ney in command. Simultaneously, the order is given to allied troops to retire 100 paces, which Ney incorrectly interprets as a withdrawal.\n\nNey leads a cavalry charge against the British, but is repelled with casualties by [[infantry square]]s. Despite this, the battle still wages much in Napoleon's favor; La Haye Sainte falls to the French, and Napoleon ultimately decides to send the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] to deliver the decisive blow.\n\nDuring their advance, [[Peregrine Maitland|Maitland's]] [[Grenadier Guards|1st Foot Guards]] who were lying in tall grass deliver a devastating point blank volley against the Imperial Guard, repulsing them with heavy casualties. At the same time, Blücher arrives in the field. For the first time in its history the Imperial Guard breaks, and the battle is won by the Allied forces.\n\nThat evening after the battle, Wellington is seen observing the thousands of casualties on the field.

[[John Huston]] was to direct.<ref>'Waterloo' Set Next Year Martin, Betty. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' 7 Oct 1965: D16.</ref>\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] published a 28-page, full-colour pictorial guide when it released ''Waterloo'' in 1970. According to the guidebook, Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis had difficulty finding financial backers for the massive undertaking until he began talks with the Soviets in the late 1960s and reached agreement with [[Mosfilm]]. Final costs were over £12 million (GBP) (equivalent to about U.S. $38.3 million in 1970), making ''Waterloo'' one of the most expensive movies ever made, for its time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Waterloo#tab=summary|title=Waterloo (1970) - Financial Information|work=The Numbers|access-date=2018-01-26}}</ref>\n\nHad the movie been filmed in the West, costs might have been as much as three times this. Mosfilm contributed more than £4 million of the costs, and nearly 17,000 soldiers of the [[Soviet Army]], including a full brigade of Soviet cavalry, and a host of engineers and labourers to prepare the battlefield in the rolling farmland outside [[Uzhhorod]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.markpack.org.uk/110409/waterloo-epic-1970-movie/|title=Waterloo: the epic 1970 movie|date=2015-01-07|work=Mark Pack|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/10/waterloo-orson-welles-reel-history|title=Waterloo: My my, Napoleon did surrender rather like this|last=Tunzelmann|first=Alex von|date=2009-09-10|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-01-26}}</ref>\n\nTo recreate the battlefield \"authentically\", the Soviets bulldozed away two hills, laid five miles of roads, transplanted 5,000 trees, sowed fields of rye, barley and wildflowers and reconstructed four historic buildings. To create the mud, more than six miles of underground irrigation piping was specially laid. Most of the battle scenes were filmed using five [[Panavision]] cameras simultaneously – from ground level, from 100-foot towers, from a helicopter, and from an overhead railway built right across the location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adventuresinhistoryland.com/tag/making-of-waterloo-1970/|title=making of Waterloo 1970 {{!}} Adventures In Historyland|website=adventuresinhistoryland.com|date=30 June 2017 |language=en|access-date=2018-01-26}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nHowever, the authentic nature of the topography is questionable and has more to do with dramatic panoramic filmshots rather than topographical accuracy: in reality, the Waterloo site is laid out as a series of low hillocks with few opportunities for long views. In particular, [[La Haye Sainte]] is almost invisible from the north and west, sitting in a small south-facing hollow.\n\nActual filming was accomplished over 28 weeks, which included 16 days of delay (principally due to bad weather). Many of the battle scenes were filmed in the summer of 1969 in often sweltering heat. In addition to the battlefield in Ukraine, filming also took place on location in the [[Royal Palace of Caserta]], Italy, while interior scenes were filmed on the large De Laurentiis Studios lot in Rome. The battle sequences of the film included about 15,000 Soviet foot soldiers and 2,000 cavalrymen as extras and 50 circus stunt riders were used to perform the dangerous horse falls. It has been joked that Sergei Bondarchuk was in command of the seventh-largest army in the world.<ref>{{citation |last=Corrigan |first=Major J.G.H. |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/t-z/waterloo.html |title=Waterloo (review) |publisher=period props were built by E.

A selected 2,000 additional men were also taught to load and fire muskets. This army lived in a large encampment next to the battlefield. Each day after breakfast, they marched to a large wardrobe building, donned their French, British or Prussian uniforms and fifteen minutes later were in position.\n\nThe soldiers were commanded by officers who took orders from director Sergei Bondarchuk via walkie-talkie. To assist in the direction of this huge, multi-national undertaking, the Soviet-Ukrainian director had four interpreters permanently at his side: one each for [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]].\n\n==Reception==\n\nIt was the fifth most popular \"reserve ticket\" movie at the British box office in 1971.<ref>Peter Waymark. \"Richard Burton top draw in British cinemas\". ''[[The Times]]'' [London, England] 30 Dec. 1971: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.</ref> However, it failed to recoup its cost. Post release saw the film gain popularity and receive numerous positive reviews for its battle depiction. Several historical characters listed in the credits do not actually appear in the film, they are said to have been in scenes cut before release.<ref>Evans, Alun (2000) ''Brassey's Guide to War Films'' Potomac Books Inc.</ref>\n\nThe film won two [[BAFTA]] awards in 1971 (Best art direction and best costume design) and was nominated for a third (best cinematography). The film was also [[novelization|novelised]] by [[Frederick E. Smith]], with the content based on the screenplay.\n\nThe meagre box office results of ''Waterloo'' led to the cancellation of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[Stanley Kubrick's unrealized projects#Napoleon|planned film biography of Napoleon]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stanley Kubrick's 'Napoleon': A Lot of Work, Very Little Actual Movie|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/nndadq/stanley-kubricks-napoleon-a-lot-of-work-very-little-actual-movie|access-date=2021-06-02|website=www.vice.com|date=10 February 2010 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[New Zealand]] film director [[Peter Jackson]], famous for the adaptations of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', said that the film inspired his future projects.<ref>\"Peter Jackson Inspiration 2\".

The tradition of the [[White wedding|bride wearing white]] did not arise until the 1840s, following [[Queen Victoria]]'s wedding.\n\nAt the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] (which itself was held in a former carriage house rather than the magnificent ballroom depicted<ref>{{cite book |last=Foulkes |first=Nick| title=Dancing into Battle: A Social History of the Battle of Waterloo |publisher=Weidenfeld &Nicholson |year=2006 |page=138 |isbn=0-297-85078-4 }}</ref>), there is an entirely fictional romantic sub-plot with [[James Hay, Lord Hay|Lord Hay]] and one of the Duchess' daughters. However, her daughter Sarah did recall Lord Hay being present at the ball.\n\nPerhaps the biggest inaccuracy in the film is the battleground itself: having had torrential rain the previous night, which delayed the French attack until midday, the battlefield was extremely muddy. In consequence, the British cavalry, in reality, would not have been able to acquire the speed shown in the film before encountering the French columns. However, here, as elsewhere, the film replicates a famous painting of the battle, in this case [[Elizabeth Thompson]]'s 1881 work ''[[Scotland Forever!]]'', which depicts the cavalry galloping towards the enemy.\n\nAnother inaccuracy is that the Household cavalry do not seem to appear in the movie at all. Further, Ponsonby, commander of the Union Brigade, is believed to have initially been taken prisoner by French cavalry, before being killed during a failed rescue attempt. In the film, he tells the Earl of Uxbridge that [[William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby|Ponsonby's father]] had been killed in battle by lancers, not least because he had been riding an inferior horse: in fact his father had been a politician who died of natural causes back in England,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=P. J. |last=Jupp |year=2004 |title=William Brabazon Ponsonby (1744–1806) |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/22506}}</ref> and he is simply foretelling his own fate in the battle.\n\nThe British cavalry charge was aimed at d'Erlon's corps, but in the film the cavalry do not appear to engage French infantry at all, but instead charge straight into French artillery, scattering French gunners before themselves being driven back by French lancers, in scenes that bear some cinematic resemblance to the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]]. Nor are any 92nd Highlanders seen hanging onto their stirrups as they charge, as was recalled by Corporal Dickson of \"F\" Troop of the Scots Greys.\n\nOverall, the film almost completely ignores the Dutch-Belgian and German elements of the army under Wellington's command, giving the impression that the allied army was essentially British. In reality, the British contingent was less than half of Wellington's troops..\n\nUnlike the Prussians in the film, arriving at the right flank of the French force, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow|General Bülow]]'s [[Order of battle of the Waterloo campaign#IV Corps 2|4th corps]] attacked at the rear-right of the French lines at the village of [[Plancenoit]]. Napoleon sent first his reserve corps (under [[Georges Mouton|General Lobau]]) and then the Second Foot Grenadiers, the second-most-senior corps of his Imperial Guard, to engage and delay these Prussians while maintaining his front line; these clashes in and around the village of Plancenoit were crucial to the battle but are not depicted in the film. (Around 7:30&nbsp;p.m., another Prussian corps under Marshal Blücher arrived on the battlefield to link with the British army on the grounds of the inn ''La Belle Alliance'', sealing the fate of the French force—as shown in the film.)\n\nThe Duke of Gordon is depicted as leading his Gordon Highlanders into battle, and is described by the Duchess of Richmond as \"uncle\": in fact, he is a [[composite character]], representing the contributions of several members of the House of Gordon. The [[Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon|Duke at the time]], the founder and colonel of the regiment, was the Duchess of Richmond's ''father'', and he saw no active service overseas during the Napoleonic Wars. His son and the Duchess's brother, the [[George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon|Marquis of Huntly]] (later the 5th Duke) was a distinguished general, but held no command in the campaign, although anecdotal evidence suggests that he arrived during the aftermath of the battle.\n\nThe senior representative of the family at the battle was in fact the Duchess's own twenty-three-year-old [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond|son, the Earl of March]], who would eventually become the 5th Duke's heir in 1836, and who served as a major and an [[aide-de-camp]] (ADC) to the Duke of Wellington. Another branch of the family was represented by another ADC, [[Alexander Gordon (British staff officer)|Colonel Sir Alexander Gordon]], aged twenty-eight or twenty-nine, the brother of the Earl of Aberdeen. In reality, both were young men similar in age and duty to Lord Hay. The field commander of the Gordon regiment during the campaign, Lieutenant Colonel, [[John Cameron of Fassiefern]], had been killed at the battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first1=H. M. |last1=Chichester |first2=John (reviewer)|last2=Sweetman |year=2004 |title=Cameron, John (1771–1815)|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher= Oxford University Press |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4446}}</ref> The acting commander of the regiment during the battle appears to have been Major Donald MacDonald of Dalchosnie.\n\nLord Hay is seen being killed during the French cavalry attack, whilst inside a British square, with Wellington witnessing his death. Hay was actually killed at the Battle of Quatre Bras, two days earlier.\n\nThe story of the refusal of the guard to surrender has been the subject of much controversy over the centuries. Commander of the last Imperial Guard square, General [[Pierre Cambronne]], is portrayed as responding \"merde\" although he denied it later. Nor did he say \"[[La garde meurt et ne se rend pas!]]\" (\"The Guard dies and does not surrender!\") which is believed to have been uttered by General [[Claude-Étienne Michel]], commander of the Middle Guard.\n\nCambronne did not die in the battle, and having been knocked unconscious, was captured by Colonel [[Hugh Halkett]], commander of the 3rd Hanoverian Brigade. He later married the Scottish nurse who cared for him after the battle, and died in 1842.\n\nThe song Boney Was a Warrior sung when Wellington's troops are awaiting the attack wasn't written until after the battle.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Amg movie|53582|Waterloo}}\n* {{IMDb title|0066549|Waterloo}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|waterloo|Waterloo}}\n\n{{Sergei Bondarchuk}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Waterloo (Film)}}\n[[Category:1970 films]]\n[[Category:1970s war drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s historical drama films]]\n[[Category:1970 drama films]]\n[[Category:Bondarchuk family]]\n[[Category:British historical drama films]]\n[[Category:British war drama films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Louis XVII]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Napoleon]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Napoleon on film]]\n[[Category:English-language Italian films]]\n[[Category:English-language Soviet films]]\n[[Category:Films about battles and military operations]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sergei Bondarchuk]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Nino Rota]]\n[[Category:Films about Napoleon]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1812]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1815]]\n[[Category:Films set in France]]\n[[Category:Films set in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Films set in Waterloo, Belgium]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Italian drama films]]\n[[Category:Mosfilm films]]\n[[Category:Napoleonic Wars films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Russian war drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet historical drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet war drama films]]\n[[Category:War films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:War epic films]]\n[[Category:Works about the Battle of Waterloo]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s British films]]\n[[Category:1970s Italian films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Louis XVIII]]\n[[Category:Jean-de-Dieu Soult]]","_bytes":27882,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2023-10-08T16:03:08Z"},"title":"Waterloo (1970 film)","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}

Other things that made the North Tower distinguishable from its twin was a canopy connected to the North Tower's west facade on street level as well as two pedestrian walkways that extended from the west and south promenades of Three and Six World Trade Center to the North Tower's north and south facades on plaza level, all of which the South Tower lacked. The building's address was '''1 World Trade Center''', and the WTC complex had its own [[ZIP code]] ([[10048 (ZIP code)|10048]]) due to its large size.\n\nThe original World Trade Center was destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]].

To decrypt the file, the file system uses the private key of the user to decrypt the symmetric key stored in the file header. It then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the file.

By default, local administrators are ''recovery agents'' however they can be customized using [[Group Policy]].\n\n=== Basic and dynamic disk storage ===\n{{main|Logical Disk Manager}}\n\nWindows 2000 introduced the [[Logical Disk Manager]] and the [[diskpart]] command line tool for [[Logical Disk Manager|dynamic storage]].<ref name=\"DiskManagement\"/> All versions of Windows 2000 support three types of [[Logical Disk Manager|dynamic]] disk volumes (along with basic disks): ''simple volumes'', ''spanned volumes'' and ''striped volumes'':\n* '''Simple volume''', a volume with disk space from one disk.\n* '''Spanned volumes''', where up to 32 disks show up as one, increasing it in size but not enhancing performance. When one disk fails, the array is destroyed. Some data may be recoverable. This corresponds to [[JBOD#Concatenation (SPAN, BIG)|SPAN]] and not to [[Standard RAID levels#RAID 1|RAID-1]].\n* '''Striped volumes''', also known as [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 0|RAID-0]], store all their data across several disks in ''stripes''. This allows better performance because disk reads and writes are balanced across multiple disks. Like spanned volumes, when one disk in the array fails, the entire array is destroyed (some data may be recoverable).\n\nIn addition to these disk volumes, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server support ''mirrored volumes'' and ''striped volumes with parity'':\n* '''Mirrored volumes''', also known as [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 1|RAID-1]], store identical copies of their data on 2 or more identical disks (''mirrored''). This allows for fault tolerance; in the event one disk fails, the other disk(s) can keep the server operational until the server can be shut down for replacement of the failed disk.\n* '''Striped volumes with parity''', also known as [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 5|RAID-5]], functions similar to striped volumes/RAID-0, except \"parity data\" is written out across each of the disks in addition to the data. This allows the data to be \"rebuilt\" in the event a disk in the array needs replacement.\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nWith Windows 2000, Microsoft introduced the Windows 9x accessibility features for people with visual and auditory impairments and other [[disability|disabilities]] into the NT-line of operating systems.<ref name=\"Accessibility\"/> These included:\n* '''[[Sticky keys|StickyKeys]]''': makes modifier keys (<code>ALT</code>, <code>CTRL</code> and <code>SHIFT</code>) become \"sticky\": a user can press the [[modifier key]], and then release it before pressing the combination key.

This image shows a [[disk defragmentation]] in progress.]]\n\nWindows 2000 introduced the [[Microsoft Management Console]] (MMC), which is used to create, save, and open administrative tools.<ref name=\"MMC\" /> Each of these is called a ''console'', and most allow an administrator to administer other Windows 2000 computers from one centralised computer. Each console can contain one or many specific administrative tools, called ''snap-ins''.<ref name=\"MMC\" /> These can be either standalone (with one function), or an extension (adding functions to an existing snap-in). In order to provide the ability to control what snap-ins can be seen in a console, the MMC allows consoles to be created in ''author mode'' or ''user mode''.<ref name=\"MMC\" /> Author mode allows snap-ins to be added, new windows to be created, all portions of the console tree to be displayed and consoles to be saved. User mode allows consoles to be distributed with restrictions applied. User mode consoles can grant full access to the user for any change, or they can grant limited access, preventing users from adding snapins to the console though they can view multiple windows in a console. Alternatively users can be granted limited access, preventing them from adding to the console and stopping them from viewing multiple windows in a single console.<ref>''Microsoft Press'' (2000).

Windows 2000 Professional includes an SNTP client.\n\nThe Server editions include more features and components, including the Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS), Active Directory support and fault-tolerant storage.\n\n==== Distributed File System ====\n{{main|Distributed File System (Microsoft)}}\n\nThe Distributed File System (DFS) allows [[Server Message Block|shares]] in multiple different locations to be logically grouped under one folder, or ''DFS root''. When users try to access a [[Shared resource|network share]] off the DFS root, the user is really looking at a ''DFS link'' and the DFS server transparently redirects them to the correct [[file server]] and share. A DFS root can only exist on a Windows 2000 version that is part of the server family, and only one DFS root can exist on that server.\n\nThere can be two ways of implementing a DFS namespace on Windows 2000: either through a standalone DFS root or a domain-based DFS root. Standalone DFS allows for only DFS roots on the local computer, and thus does not use Active Directory. Domain-based DFS roots exist within Active Directory and can have their information distributed to other [[domain controller]]s within the domain – this provides [[Fault-tolerant system|fault tolerance]] to DFS. DFS roots that exist on a domain must be hosted on a domain controller or on a domain member server. The file and root information is replicated via the Microsoft [[File Replication Service]] (FRS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/812487|title=Microsoft KB article 812487: Overview of DFS in Windows 2000|access-date=September 17, 2006|archive-date=February 14, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214115202/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/812487|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Active Directory ====\n{{main|Active Directory}}\n\nA new way of organizing [[Windows Server domain|Windows network domains]], or groups of resources, called Active Directory, is introduced with Windows 2000 to replace Windows NT's earlier domain model. Active Directory's hierarchical nature allowed administrators a built-in way to manage user and computer policies and user accounts, and to automatically deploy programs and updates with a greater degree of scalability and centralization than provided in previous Windows versions. User information stored in Active Directory also provided a convenient phone book-like function to end users. Active Directory domains can vary from small installations with a few hundred objects, to large installations with millions. Active Directory can organise and link groups of domains into a contiguous [[domain name]] space to form ''trees''. Groups of trees outside of the same namespace can be linked together to form ''forests.''\n\nActive Directory services could always be installed on a Windows 2000 Server Standard, Advanced, or Datacenter computer, and cannot be installed on a Windows 2000 Professional computer. However, Windows 2000 Professional is the first client operating system able to exploit Active Directory's new features. As part of an organization's migration, Windows NT clients continued to function until all clients were upgraded to Windows 2000 Professional, at which point the Active Directory domain could be switched to [[native mode]] and maximum functionality achieved.\n\nActive Directory requires a DNS server that supports [[SRV resource record]]s, or that an organization's existing DNS infrastructure be upgraded to support this. There should be one or more [[domain controller]]s to hold the Active Directory database and provide Active Directory [[directory services]].\n\n==== Volume fault tolerance ====\nAlong with support for simple, spanned and striped volumes, the Windows 2000 Server family also supports fault-tolerant volume types. The types supported are ''mirrored volumes'' and ''RAID-5 volumes'':\n* '''Mirrored volumes:''' the volume contains several disks, and when data is written to one it is also written to the other disks. This means that if one disk fails, the data can be totally recovered from the other disk. Mirrored volumes are also known as [[Redundant array of independent disks#RAID 1|RAID-1]].\n* '''RAID-5 volumes:''' a [[RAID 5|RAID-5]] volume consists of multiple disks, and it uses [[Block (data storage)|block]]-level striping with parity data distributed across all member disks. Should a disk fail in the array, the parity blocks from the surviving disks are combined mathematically with the data blocks from the surviving disks to reconstruct the data on the failed drive \"on-the-fly.\"\n\n== Deployment ==\n{{System requirements\n|caption = Windows 2000 system requirements\n|useminandrec = yes\n|collapse =\n|align = right\n|font-size = 100%\n<!-- Mandatory section -->\n|platform1 = [[IA-32]] PCs\n|cpu1 = Pentium 133 MHz\n|cpu1rec = Pentium II 300 MHz\n|memory1 = 32 MB (128 MB for Windows 2000 Server)\n|memory1rec = 128 MB (256 MB for Windows 2000 Server)\n|gpu1 = 800×600 VGA or better monitor\n|gpu1rec = 1024×768 VGA or better monitor\n|hdspace1 = 1 GB (2 GB for Windows 2000 Server)\n|hdspace1rec = 5 GB\n|input1 = Keyboard and/or mouse\n}}\n\nWindows 2000 can be [[software deployment|deployed]] to a site via various methods. It can be installed onto servers via traditional media (such as CD) or via distribution folders that reside on a shared folder. Installations can be attended or [[Unattended installation|unattended]]. During a manual installation, the administrator must specify configuration options. Unattended installations are scripted via an [[answer file]], or a predefined script in the form of an [[initialization file|INI file]] that has all the options filled in. An answer file can be created manually or using the graphical ''Setup manager''. The Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe program then uses that answer file to automate the installation. Unattended installations can be performed via a bootable CD, using Microsoft [[Systems Management Server]] (SMS), via the [[Sysprep|System Preparation Tool (Sysprep)]], via the Winnt32.exe program using the /syspart switch or via [[Remote Installation Services]] (RIS). The ability to [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstream]] a [[service pack]] into the original operating system setup files is also introduced in Windows 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/deploy/depopt/easydep.mspx#EKFAC |title=Make deployment easier in Windows 2000 |work=Microsoft.com |access-date=November 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615114603/http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/deploy/depopt/easydep.mspx#EKFAC |archive-date=June 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Sysprep method is started on a standardized reference computer – though the hardware need not be similar – and it copies the required installation files from the reference computer to the target computers. The hard drive does not need to be in the target computer and may be swapped out to it at any time, with the hardware configured later. The Winnt.exe program must also be passed a /unattend switch that points to a valid answer file and a /s file that points to one or more valid installation sources.\n\nSysprep allows the duplication of a [[disk image]] on an existing Windows 2000 Server installation to multiple servers. This means that all applications and system configuration settings will be copied across to the new installations, and thus, the reference and target computers must have the same [[Hardware Abstraction Layer|HALs]], [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] support, and mass storage devices – though Windows 2000 automatically detects \"[[plug and play]]\" devices. The primary reason for using Sysprep is to quickly deploy Windows 2000 to a site that has multiple computers with standard hardware. (If a system had different HALs, mass storage devices or ACPI support, then multiple images would need to be maintained.)\n\nSystems Management Server can be used to upgrade multiple computers to Windows 2000. These must be running Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98 or Windows 95 OSR2.x along with the SMS client agent that can receive software installation operations. Using SMS allows installations over a wide area and provides centralised control over upgrades to systems.\n\n[[Remote Installation Services]] (RIS) are a means to automatically install Windows 2000 Professional (and not Windows 2000 Server) to a local computer over a network from a central server. Images do not have to support specific hardware configurations and the security settings can be configured after the computer reboots as the service generates a new unique security ID (SID) for the machine. This is required so that local accounts are given the right identifier and do not clash with other Windows 2000 Professional computers on a network.<ref>Mark Minasi. ''Installing Windows 2000 on Workstations with Remote Installation Services''.</ref>\nRIS requires that client computers are able to boot over the network via either a [[network interface card]] that has a [[Pre-Boot Execution Environment]] (PXE) boot [[Read-only memory|ROM]] installed or that the client computer has a network card installed that is supported by the remote [[boot disk]] generator. The [[remote computer]] must also meet the [[Net PC]] specification. The server that RIS runs on must be Windows 2000 Server and it must be able to access a network [[Domain Name System|DNS]] Service, a [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] service and the Active Directory services.<ref>''Microsoft Press'' (2000).

It is the client version of Windows 2000. It offers greater security and stability than many of the previous Windows desktop operating systems. It supports up to two [[central processing unit|processors]], and can address up to 4{{nbsp}}[[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. The system requirements are a Pentium processor (or equivalent) of 133{{nbsp}}MHz or greater, at least 32{{nbsp}}MB of RAM, 650{{nbsp}}MB of hard drive space, and a [[CD-ROM]] drive (recommended: [[Pentium II]], 128{{nbsp}}MB of RAM, 2{{nbsp}}GB of hard drive space, and CD-ROM drive).<ref name=\"SysReq\">{{cite web\n|url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/304297\n|title = System requirements for Microsoft Windows 2000 operating systems\n|access-date = May 23, 2008\n|archive-date = April 16, 2008\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416050811/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/304297\n|url-status = live\n}}</ref> However, despite the official minimum processor requirements, it is still possible to install Windows 2000 on 4th-generation x86 CPUs such as the [[80486]].\n\n{{Anchor|Windows 2000 Server|Windows 2K Server|2KS}}\n[[File:Windows 2000 Server.png|right|thumb|Screenshot of Windows 2000 Server with ''Configure Your Server'' component.]]\n'''Windows 2000 Server''' shares the same [[user interface]] with Windows 2000 Professional, but contains additional components for the computer to perform [[Server (computing)|server]] roles and run infrastructure and [[application software]]. A significant new component introduced in the server versions is [[Active Directory]], which is an enterprise-wide directory service based on [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). Additionally, Microsoft integrated [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] network authentication, replacing the often-criticised [[NTLM]] (NT LAN Manager) authentication system used in previous versions. This also provided a purely [[Active Directory#Trust|transitive-trust]] relationship between Windows 2000 Server [[Windows Server domain|domains]] in a ''[[Active Directory#Forests, trees, and domains|forest]]'' (a collection of one or more Windows 2000 domains that share a common [[Active Directory#Objects|schema]], configuration, and [[Active Directory#Forests, trees, and domains|global catalog]], being linked with two-way [[Active Directory#Trust|transitive trusts]]). Furthermore, Windows 2000 introduced a [[Microsoft DNS|Domain Name Server]] which allows dynamic registration of [[Internet Protocol|IP]] addresses. Windows 2000 Server supports up to 4 processors and 4{{nbsp}}GB of RAM, with a minimum requirement of 128{{nbsp}}MB of RAM and 1{{nbsp}}GB hard disk space, however requirements may be higher depending on installed components.<ref name=\"SysReq\"/>\n\n{{Anchor|Windows 2000 Advanced Server|Windows 2K Advanced Server|2KAS}}\n'''Windows 2000 Advanced Server''' is a variant of Windows 2000 Server operating system designed for medium-to-large businesses.

IDC's report is based on telephone interviews of IT executives and managers of 104 North American companies in which they determined what they were using for a specific workload for file, print, security and networking services.\nIDC determined that the four areas where Windows 2000 had a better TCO than Linux – over a period of five years for an average organization of 100 employees – were file, print, network infrastructure and security infrastructure. They determined, however, that Linux had a better TCO than Windows 2000 for web serving. The report also found that the greatest cost was not in the procurement of software and hardware, but in staffing costs and downtime. While the report applied a 40% productivity factor during IT infrastructure downtime, recognizing that employees are not entirely unproductive, it did not consider the impact of downtime on the profitability of the business. The report stated that Linux servers had less unplanned downtime than Windows 2000 servers. It found that most Linux servers ran less workload per server than Windows 2000 servers and also that none of the businesses interviewed used 4-way [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] Linux computers. The report also did not take into account specific [[application server]]s – servers that need low maintenance and are provided by a specific vendor. The report did emphasize that TCO was only one factor in considering whether to use a particular IT platform, and also noted that as management and server software improved and became better packaged the overall picture shown could change.<ref>\"[http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/docs/TCO.pdf Windows 2000 Versus Linux in Enterprise Computing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410033809/http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/docs/TCO.pdf |date=April 10, 2008 }},\" ''IDC''.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Architecture of Windows NT]]\n* [[BlueKeep|BlueKeep (security vulnerability)]]\n* [[Comparison of operating systems]]\n* [[DEC Multia]], one of the DEC Alpha computers capable of running Windows 2000 beta\n* [[Microsoft Servers]], Microsoft's network server software brand\n* [[Windows Neptune]], a cancelled consumer edition based on Windows 2000\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bolosky, William J.; Corbin, Scott; Goebel, David; & Douceur, John R. \"[http://research.microsoft.com/sn/Farsite/WSS2000.pdf Single Instance Storage in Windows 2000].\" ''Microsoft Research'' & ''Balder Technology Group, Inc.''

Be aware that the content of the release may no longer be current.\n\n----\n\n Free Encyclopedia Project, Wikipedia, Creates 20,000 Articles in a Year\n\n    SAN DIEGO, Jan. 15 /PRNewswire/ -- The free encyclopedia project Wikipedia\n ( http://www.wikipedia.com ) celebrates its first anniversary today.  In its\n first year, the collaborative project has created over 20,000 articles,\n organizers say.  Wikipedia is a so-called WikiWiki, which means that anyone\n with an Internet connection can visit the website and edit an article without\n signing up.  For such an open project, some may find it remarkable that many\n of the articles are reasonably good and that the project has attracted a large\n number of well-educated, articulate contributors.\n     Wikipedia is not only free to read, it is free to distribute.  It is\n released under the GNU Free Documentation License, which ensures that anyone\n may reuse the entries on the site in any way they wish, including\n commercially, as long as they too preserve that right in their own versions.\n Many participants are attracted to the notion that they are contributing to a\n completely free resource that can be used worldwide.\n     The founders of Wikipedia are Internet entrepreneur Jimmy Wales and\n philosopher Larry Sanger.  Wales has supplied the financial backing and other\n support for the project, and Sanger, who earned a Ph.D. in Philosophy from\n Ohio State in 2000, has led the project.  Sanger and Wales attribute\n Wikipedia's success so far to the presence of a strong core group of\n contributors who together maintain community standards of quality and\n neutrality.  \"Participants all keep a watchful eye over the 'Recent Changes'\n page,\" Wales said.  \"They edit each others' work constantly.  It seems\n surprising that it works very well, but it does.\"\n     The project began life quietly in January 2001 as an offshoot of its more\n academic sister project, Nupedia ( http://www.nupedia.com ), but has long\n since overtaken it in terms of size.  Wikipedia announced 10,000 articles last\n September, and claims to have doubled that number in the past four months.\n This growth, and the project dynamics that fuel it, have recently been the\n subject of articles in The New York Times, The New York Times Magazine, and\n MIT's highly-respected Technology Review, as well as technology news websites\n such as Slashdot and Kuro5hin.\n     At present, nearly 200 people are working on the project daily, from all\n around the world; organizers estimate that the project has had well over a\n thousand contributors.  The success of such an open project, staffed by such a\n large and diverse body of writers, is a puzzle: how can so many people with so\n many different backgrounds collaborate with such little oversight?  Project\n organizers say that it is partly because the participants can edit each\n others' contributions easily, and partly because the project has a strong\n \"nonbias\" policy; this keeps interaction relatively polite and productive.\n Sanger explains: \"If contributors took controversial stands, it would be\n virtually impossible for people of many different viewpoints to collaborate.\n Because of the neutrality policy, we have partisans working together on the\n same articles.  It's quite remarkable.\"\n     What motivates a scholar to participate in such a wide-open project?  For\n Axel Boldt, a mathematics professor at Metropolitan State University in\n St. Paul, Minnesota, the motivation to contribute dozens of mathematics\n articles is \"the same that motivates me to work in academia: it's fun to\n teach, it's fun to learn, it's fun to interact with intelligent people.\"\n     Sanger has been invited to speak about Wikipedia at the\n Stanford University Computer Systems Laboratory colloquium on January 16; the\n press is invited to attend or to view the talk via the Internet.

The XFL was operated as a joint venture between the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) and [[NBC]]. The XFL was conceived as an outdoor football league that would begin play immediately after the [[National Football League]] (NFL) season ended, to take advantage of the perceived lingering public desire to watch football after the NFL and [[college football]] seasons conclude. It was promoted as having fewer rules to encourage rougher play than other major leagues, while its telecasts featured [[sports entertainment]] elements inspired by [[professional wrestling]] (and in particular, the WWF's then-current \"[[Attitude Era]]\"), including [[heat (wrestling)|heat]] and [[kayfabe]], and suggestively-dressed [[cheerleader]]s. Commentary crews also featured WWF commentators (such as [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Jim Ross]], and [[Jerry Lawler]]) joined by sportscasters and veteran football players. Despite the wrestling influence, the games and their outcomes were [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] and not based on scripted storylines.\n\nThe XFL operated as a single entity with all teams owned by the league, in contrast to most major professional leagues, which use a [[Professional sports league organization|franchise]] model with individual owners. The league had eight teams in two divisions, and each franchise was based in a market that either currently had an NFL team (New York/New Jersey, Chicago, San Francisco); had previously supported other pro leagues like the [[United States Football League]], the original [[NFL Europe|World League]], or the [[CFL USA|Canadian Football League]] (Memphis, Orlando, Birmingham, Las Vegas); or was the largest market without a professional franchise (Los Angeles). Co-owner NBC served as the main carrier of XFL games, with [[UPN]] and [[Paramount Network|TNN]] also carrying selected games.\n\nThe first night of play brought higher television viewership than NBC had projected, but ratings exponentially plummeted for subsequent games, with criticism directed toward its overall quality of play, on-air presentation and connection to the WWF, prompting NBC to pull out of the venture after one season. While plans were made to continue without NBC (with plans for expansion teams as well), UPN allegedly made inordinate demands of the league, which hastened its demise. The league ceased operations entirely in May 2001. Its closure was announced just a few weeks after the [[Million Dollar Game|league's season championship game]], in which the [[Los Angeles Xtreme]] defeated the [[San Francisco Demons]], on April 21, 2001, at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].\n\nDespite its short-lived existence, the XFL did pioneer several on-air technologies that would later become commonplace in football telecasts, such as aerial [[skycam]]s, and on-player microphones. WWE owner [[Vince McMahon]] maintained control of the XFL brand after the league ceased operations, despite many, including McMahon himself, considering the original league to be a \"colossal failure.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Why the XFL failed |website=sportinglife360.com |url=http://www.sportinglife360.com/index.php/why-the-xfl-failed-19101/ |archive-date=2014-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105859/http://www.sportinglife360.com/index.php/why-the-xfl-failed-19101/}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.forbes.com/2001/05/11/0511topnews.html |series=Top of the News |title=XFL exterminated |magazine=[[Forbes]] |date=2001-05-11 |access-date=December 17, 2015}}</ref>  Interest in the league was revived when [[ESPN Films]] released a ''[[30 for 30]]'' documentary surrounding the league, and shortly after the film debuted, McMahon began preparing for a [[XFL (2020)|new iteration of the league]] in 2020. The new XFL was run by a new McMahon-controlled company independent from the present-day [[WWE]], and did not utilize the sports entertainment elements featured in the previous incarnation. The second iteration of the XFL's [[2020 XFL season|inaugural season]] was aborted due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], and the league suspended operations and filed for bankruptcy in April 2020, with McMahon relinquishing the XFL brand in a sale to his former WWE wrestler [[Dwayne Johnson]] and [[Dany Garcia]] that August.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/xfl/story/_/id/29021347/xfl-suspends-operations-lays-employees-no-plans-return-2021|title=XFL suspends operations, lays off employees and has no plans for 2021 season|last=Siefert|first=Kevin|date=10 April 2020|work=[[ESPN.com]]|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/xfl/story/_/id/29030763/xfl-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-suspending-operations|title=XFL files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after suspending operations|last=Seifert|first=Kevin|date=13 April 2020|work=ESPN.com|access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Founding==\nCreated as a 50–50 joint venture between [[NBC]] and WWE-owned subsidiary WWE Properties International, Inc.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/otherfb/news/2001/0327/1163009.html |title=DeVito says NBC not necessary for next year |date=March 27, 2001 |website=[[ESPN]] |publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=January 23, 2014}}</ref> under the company name \"XFL, LLC\", the XFL was created as a \"[[Legal entity|single-entity league]];\" instead of the [[sports franchising|franchise model]] used by the NFL and other major leagues, or the hybrid model where investors in the league are given operations over teams (as used in [[Major League Soccer]]), the XFL uniformly owned and operated all of its teams as one corporation, with no individual owners.

The XFL was originally conceived to build on the success of the NFL and [[professional wrestling]]. It combined the traditional game of American football with the [[kayfabe]] and stunts of professional wrestling. As [[WWE|WWF]] was, at the time, in the midst of its \"[[Attitude Era]]\" (which marked a shift in a mature and provocative direction for its content), the XFL's presentation likewise would reflect that approach toward football.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/346025 |title=What Entrepreneurs Can Learn From the XFL's Second Attempt at Victory |last=Womack |first=Josh |date=2020-02-07 |website=Entrepreneur |language=en |access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> It was hyped as \"real\" football without penalties for roughness and with fewer rules in general. The games would feature players and coaches with microphones and cameras in the huddle and in the [[locker room]]s. Stadiums featured [[trash-talk]]ing public address announcers and scantily-clad [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]]s who were encouraged to date the players. Instead of a pre-game coin toss, XFL officials put the ball on the ground and let a player from each team scramble for it to determine who received the kickoff option. The practice was dubbed \"The Human Coin Toss\" by commentators, and one player famously separated his shoulder on the first scramble, missing the rest of the season.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/this-is-the-xfl-again-controversial-football-league-set-to-return-in-2020/ |title=This is the XFL, again: Controversial football league set to return in 2020 |work=CBSSports.com |access-date=January 25, 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe XFL featured extensive television coverage, with three games televised each week on [[NBC]], [[UPN]], and [[Spike (TV channel)#The National Network and The New TNN (2000-2003)|TNN]]. To accommodate this, it placed four of its teams in the four largest U.S. media markets: [[New York metropolitan area|New York City/North Jersey]], [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Greater Los Angeles]] (this was during the [[History of the National Football League in Los Angeles|NFL's 21-year absence from the Los Angeles metro area]]). The remaining four teams were placed in markets that had previously hosted teams in second-tier and/or rival major leagues: Birmingham, Memphis, Las Vegas, and Orlando. All of the XFL's markets except Las Vegas had hosted teams in the [[United States Football League]] in the 1980s; Las Vegas, along with Birmingham and Memphis, had hosted short-lived CFL teams in the 1990s.\n\nThe XFL chose unusual names for its teams, most of which either referenced images of uncontrolled insanity ([[Memphis Maniax|Maniax]], [[Orlando Rage|Rage]], [[Los Angeles Xtreme|Xtreme]], [[San Francisco Demons|Demons]]) or criminal activity ([[Chicago Enforcers|Enforcers]], [[New York/New Jersey Hitmen|Hitmen]], [[Las Vegas Outlaws (XFL)|Outlaws]], and the [[Birmingham Thunderbolts|Birmingham Blast]]). After outrage from Birmingham residents who noted that Birmingham had a history of notorious \"blasts\", including the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] in 1963 and [[Eric Rudolph]]'s 1998 bombing of a local abortion clinic, the XFL changed the name of the Birmingham team to the more benign \"Birmingham Thunderbolts\" (later shortened to \"Bolts\").<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Bolts for short |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2000/08/24/xfl_birmingham_ap/ |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 25, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010185318/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2000/08/24/xfl_birmingham_ap/ |archive-date=October 10, 2008 |access-date=August 31, 2014}}</ref>\n\nContrary to popular belief, the \"X\" in XFL did not stand for \"extreme\", as in \"eXtreme Football League\".{{sfn|Forrest|2002|p=9}} When the league was first organized in 1999, it was originally supposed to stand for \"Xtreme Football League\"; however, there was already a league in formation at the same time with that name, and so promoters wanted to make sure that everyone knew that the \"X\" did not actually stand for anything (though McMahon would comment that \"if the NFL stood for the 'No Fun League', the XFL will stand for the 'e'''x'''tra '''f'''un '''l'''eague'\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/04/sports/sports-business-wwf-alters-script-and-looks-to-football.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |series=Sports Business |title=W.W.E. alters script and looks to football |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |date=February 4, 2000}}</ref>). The other Xtreme Football League, which was also organized in 1999, merged with the [[Arena Football League]]'s minor league [[AF2]] before ever playing a single game. In a much later article describing the origins of the league's name, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' stated: \"The F and the L act to indicate, if only indirectly, a football league. But the X is a variable. It could mean anything.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/05/01/new-xfl-wwe-football-league-2020-oliver-luck-commissioner |title=Oliver Luck and XFL 2.0: What's different this time |date=2019-05-01 |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref>\n\n==Draft==\n{{Main|2001 XFL Draft}}\n\nThe only main draft for the league took place over a three-day period from October 28 to October 30, 2000. A total of 475&nbsp;players were selected initially, with 65&nbsp;additional players then selected in a supplemental draft on December 29, 2000.\n\n==Teams==\n[[File:XFL-USA-states.svg|thumb|right|250px|\n{{Legend|#000000|Eastern Division}}\n{{Legend|#ED171F|Western Division}}]]\n'''Eastern Division'''\n* [[Birmingham Thunderbolts]]\n* [[Chicago Enforcers]]\n* [[New York/New Jersey Hitmen]]\n* [[Orlando Rage]]\n\n'''Western Division'''\n* [[Las Vegas Outlaws (XFL)|Las Vegas Outlaws]]\n* [[Los Angeles Xtreme]]\n* [[Memphis Maniax]]\n* [[San Francisco Demons]]\n\n==2001 season==\n[[File:XflNight.JPG|thumb|250px|A [[Chicago Enforcers]] XFL game at [[Soldier Field]]]]\n\n===On the field===\nThe XFL's opening game took place on February 3, 2001, one year after the league was announced, less than one week following the NFL's [[Super Bowl XXXV]]. The first game was between the [[New York/New Jersey Hitmen]] and the [[Las Vegas Outlaws (XFL)|Las Vegas Outlaws]] at [[Sam Boyd Stadium]] in [[Whitney, Nevada]].\n\nThe league's regular season structure was set up so that each team played teams in its own division twice in the season, home and away (the same as the [[National Football League]]) and played against teams in the other division once. The season ran ten weeks, with no [[bye (sports)|bye weeks]].\n\nThe league's western division was far more competitive than the east, with the four teams' records ranging from 7–3 (for eventual champion Los Angeles) to 4–6 (Las Vegas, who finished last after losing its last three games to end up one game out of a playoff spot). In the East, New York and [[Chicago]] both were hampered by slow starts and ineffective starters before making personnel changes that improved their play, while Orlando, under quarterback [[Jeff Brohm]], who owned the league's highest QB rating at 99.9 during the 2001 XFL season, soared to first place, winning its first six games before Brohm suffered a career-ending injury and the team regressed (the team went 2–2 in his absence). Birmingham started the season 2–1 before a rash of injuries (and tougher competition, as its two wins were against New York and Chicago) led to the team losing the last seven games. Injuries were a major problem across the league: only three of the league's eight Opening Day starting quarterbacks—Los Angeles's [[Tommy Maddox]], San Francisco's [[Mike Pawlawski]] and Memphis's [[Jim Druckenmiller]]—were still starters by the end of the season. Birmingham and Las Vegas were both on their third-string quarterbacks by the end of the ten-week season.\n\nThe top two teams in each division qualified for the playoffs. To avoid teams having to play each other three times in a season, the league set up the semifinal round of the playoffs so that the games would feature teams from opposite divisions: the east division champion (Orlando) hosted the west division runner-up (San Francisco), and likewise for the west champion and east runner-up (Los Angeles and Chicago, respectively). Los Angeles and San Francisco each won their playoff games to advance to the [[Million Dollar Game|XFL championship]].\n\n===Off the field===\nThe opening game ended with a 19–0 victory for the Outlaws, and was watched on NBC by an estimated 14 million viewers. During the telecast, [[NBC]] switched over to the game between the [[Orlando Rage]] and the [[Chicago Enforcers]], which was a closer contest than the blowout taking place in Las Vegas. The opening night drew a 9.5&nbsp;[[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]].{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=171}}\n\nThe opening-week games actually delivered ratings double those of what NBC had promised advertisers (and more viewers than the [[2001 Pro Bowl]]). The audience declined to a 4.6 in week&nbsp;2,{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=172}} still an acceptable rating for NBC, but further ratings declines eventually led to the network abandoning the league after the season.\n\nA further problem was that the XFL itself was the brainchild of Vince McMahon, a man who was ridiculed by mainstream sports journalists due to the stigma attached to [[professional wrestling]] as being \"[[Work (professional wrestling)|fake]]\"; many journalists even jokingly speculated whether any of the league's games were [[Match fixing|rigged]], although nothing of this sort was ever seriously investigated.\n\nEbersol was disappointed with the opening game's poor quality of play.<ref name=\"ap20190213\">{{Cite news |url=https://triblive.com/pghtrib/localsports/14610673-94/aafs-officials-pleased-with-opening-weekend-tv-ratings-but-remain-cautious |title=AAF's officials pleased with opening weekend TV ratings but remain cautious |date=February 13, 2019 |work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |access-date=February 14, 2019 |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Even longtime NBC sportscaster [[Bob Costas]] joined in the mocking of the league. Ebersol purposely allowed Costas and other NBC Sports veterans to opt out of the network's coverage of the league (hence with the exception of former ''[[NFL on NBC]]'' analyst [[Mike Adamle]], its coverage was helmed mostly by younger unknowns and professional wrestling figures), and Costas in particular did not like McMahon's approach to the sport. In an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in February 2001, after the league's second week of play, Costas joked: \"It has to be at least a decade since I first mused out loud, 'Why doesn't somebody combine mediocre [[high school football]] with a tawdry [[strip club]]?'

of a \"rules-light\" game and universally negative reviews from the mainstream sports media early on, the XFL played the standard brand of 11-man American outdoor football that was recognizable, aside from the opening game sprint to determine possession and some other changes, some of which were modified during the season as it progressed. The league's coaches vetoed a proposal to eliminate ineligible receivers (allowing any player to receive a forward pass) midway through the season, on account that the change would be too radical.\n\n===Game balls===\nThe league's game balls were made by [[Spalding (company)|Spalding]], and were unique in that instead of being the standard brown, the ball was black with a red \"X\" going across the sides of the ball.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=https://corporate.wwe.com/news/company-news/2000/08-03-2000a |title=XFL Names Spalding First Official Licensee |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=August 3, 2000 |website=WWE.com |publisher=WWE |access-date=January 11, 2020 |quote=\"Spalding is one of the most recognizable names in sports and we’re very excited to have Spalding on board as our first on-field partner,\" said Basil V.

Furthermore, every XFL field was designed identically, with no individual team branding on the field. Each [[end zone]] and 50&nbsp;yard line was decorated with the XFL logo, with the endzones also being painted black.\n\nMost of the league's stadiums were football-specific facilities, the only exception being San Francisco's [[Pacific Bell Park]] (home of the [[San Francisco Giants]]) which was built primarily for [[baseball]], but (unlike many newer baseball-specific stadiums) can accommodate football. Two XFL stadiums ([[Giants Stadium]] and [[Soldier Field]]) were also then-current NFL stadiums, while two others ([[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] and the [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]]) had previously hosted NFL games; the NFL would return to the Coliseum when the [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] returned to Los Angeles in 2016. The remaining fields were in regular use as [[college football]] venues at the time.\n\nThe home team in every stadium was required to occupy the sideline opposite the press box in order to be visible to the television cameras. Due to the odd field dimensions in San Francisco, teams playing there were permitted to occupy the same sideline (a similar arrangement existed in the NFL when the [[Green Bay Packers]] played home games at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] and in stadiums previously used by the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Detroit Lions]], [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]]).\n\nThe all-grass field stipulation caused the league to skip over several of the country's largest markets, including [[Houston]] and [[Philadelphia]], since they lacked a large grass stadium in 2001.<!--Dallas had the Cotton Bowl and Detroit had Tiger Stadium--> In the league's two northernmost markets, Chicago and New York/New Jersey (the latter of which played in [[Giants Stadium]] during a brief window in which the stadium's usual artificial turf had been replaced by natural grass), the combination of the all-grass requirement, midwinter playing season and the fact that the XFL followed shortly after the NFL had used both fields for a full season (in Giants Stadium's case, two full seasons, since the Giants and Jets shared the stadium; the Giants also hosted two playoff games following the [[2000 NFL season|2000 season]]) caused significant damage to the playing fields; at Chicago's [[Soldier Field]], the wear and tear on the field was such that by midseason, the midfield logo of the NFL's [[Chicago Bears]] was clearly visible amid a stretch of dirt and dead grass.\n\nAt the time, \"next generation\" artificial surfaces (which much more closely mimicked grass in appearance, feel and player safety) were slowly being introduced in professional football. In 2000, the [[Seattle Seahawks]] were the first professional team to play on next-generation artificial turf at the [[University of Washington]]'s [[Husky Stadium]], where the Seahawks played in 2000 and 2001 following the demolition of the [[Kingdome]] and prior to the completion of what is now [[Lumen Field]]). Giants Stadium would have a next generation artificial surface installed in 2003; Soldier Field was renovated extensively in 2002 but retained its grass field. Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium and [[Legion Field]] have also installed next-generation turf fields since the demise of the original XFL.\n\n===Opening scramble===\nReplacing the [[coin toss]] at the beginning of each game was an event in which one player from each team fought to recover a football 20 yards away in order to determine possession. Both players lined up side by side on one of the 30-yard lines, with the ball being placed at the 50-yard line. At the whistle, the two players would run toward the ball and attempt to gain possession; whichever player gained possession first was allowed to choose possession (as if he had won a coin toss in other leagues). The XFL's first injury infamously resulted from the opening scramble; [[Orlando Rage|Orlando]] free safety [[Hassan Shamsid-Deen]] suffered a [[separated shoulder]] prior to the Rage's 33–29 season-opening win over the [[Chicago Enforcers]] at [[Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium]] on February 3.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/020401/Sports/League_starts_in_Orla.shtml |author=Cotey, John C. |title=League starts in Orlando with pageantry, pain |place=St. Petersburg, FL |newspaper=Sunday Times |date=February 4, 2001}}</ref> He ended up missing the remainder of the campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20010207-2001-02-07-0102070013-story.html|title=XFL Shocking? No more than the Redskins |first=Warner |last=Hessler |website=dailypress.com}}</ref>\n\n===No PAT (point after touchdown) kicks===\nAfter every [[touchdown]] scored, no extra point after kicks were done, due to the XFL's perception that an extra-point kick was a \"guaranteed point.\" To earn a point after a touchdown, teams ran a single offensive down from the two-yard line (functionally identical to the NFL / NCAA / CFL [[two-point conversion]], but for just a single point as it had been before the two-point conversion was adopted). By the playoffs, two-point and three-point conversions had been added to the rules. Teams could opt for the bonus points by playing the conversion farther back from the goal line. However, touchdowns were still worth 6 points.\n\nThis rule, as originally implemented, was similar to the [[World Football League|WFL]]'s \"Action Point\", and was identical to a 1968 \"Pressure Point\" experiment by the NFL and the [[American Football League]], used only in preseason interleague games that year.\n\nIn 2015, the NFL, CFL and other professional leagues would address the \"guaranteed point\" concerns by moving the extra point kick back to the 15-yard and 25-yard lines, respectively, thus making the length of the kick the same distance (taking into account the NFL's position of the goalposts on the end line, and the CFL's goalposts being positioned on the goal line). The [[Alliance of American Football]] (AAF) in 2019 adopted this \"no extra point kick\" rule from the original XFL, albeit making the scrimmage play conversion two points as in other levels of the game. The revived XFL kept the conversion system used during the playoffs.\n\n===Overtime===\nTies were to be resolved in similar fashion to the NCAA and in the CFL today, with at least one possession by each team, starting from the opponent's 20-yard line. There were differences: there were no first downs and thus teams had to score within four downs, and the team that had possession first in overtime could not attempt a field goal until fourth down. If that team managed to score a touchdown in fewer than four downs, the second team would only have that same number of downs to match or beat the result. If the score was still tied after one overtime period, the team that played second on offense in the first OT would start on offense in the second OT (similar to the rules of college football overtime). The process would be repeated until a winner was determined; unlike the CFL and NFL, but like college football, games could not end in ties even in the regular season.\n\n===Bump and run===\nThe XFL allowed full [[bump and run coverage]] early in the season. Defensive backs were allowed to hit wide receivers any time before the quarterback released the ball, as long as the hit came from the front or the side.\n\nFollowing the fourth week of the season, bump and run was restricted to the first five yards from the line of scrimmage (similar to NFL and CFL) in an effort to increase offensive production.\n\n===Forward motion===\nUnlike the [[National Football League|NFL]], but like the [[World Football League]] and [[Arena Football League]] before it<!--NOT like Canadian football, which has totally different forward motion rules-->, the XFL allowed one offensive player to [[motion (football)|move]] toward the line of scrimmage once he was outside the tackles.\n\n===Punting rules===\nThe XFL imposed a number of restrictions on [[punt (gridiron football)|punting]] that are not present in most other leagues' rules, the net effect of which made punts in the XFL operate under rules more akin to [[kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoffs]]. The purpose of these provisions was to keep play going after the ball was punted, encouraging the kicking team to make the ball playable and the receiving team to run it back. To this effect:\n* Punting out of bounds was a ten-yard [[penalty (gridiron football)|penalty]], effectively outlawing the [[coffin corner punt]] commonplace at most other levels of the game.\n* Any punt that traveled at least 25 yards past the line of scrimmage could be recovered by the kicking team, thus legalizing to an extent the [[Bomb (kick)|up-and-under or garryowen]] common to [[rugby football]] codes. Thus, instead of letting the kicking team down the ball as is common in other leagues, the receiving team was required to try and return the punt or else lose possession.\n* The kicking team was prohibited from coming within five yards of the [[punt returner]] before he gained possession of the ball. This rule, known as the halo rule in college football and also common in the CFL, was dubbed the \"danger zone\" in the XFL. Coming within 5{{nbsp}}yards or less of this \"danger zone\" entailed a {{nobreak|5-yard}} penalty, much in the same vein as the CFL's \"no yards\" penalty.\n* [[Fair catch]]es were not recognized. (The \"no fair catch\" rule was one of the most heavily hyped rule differences in the XFL and a central part of the league's marketing campaign, and like the above \"no yards\" penalty, fair catches were not recognized in Canadian football.)\n\nFor the initial weeks of the season, the XFL forbade all players on the kicking team from going downfield before a kick was made from scrimmage on that down, similarly to a rule the NFL considered in 1974. For the rest of the season the XFL modified it to allow one player closest to each sideline downfield ahead of the kick, the same modification the NFL adopted to their change just before their 1974 exhibition games started.\n\nAllowing the kicking team to recover a punt did encourage noticeably more [[quick kick]]s over the course of the XFL's lone season than was typically seen in the NFL over the preceding decades, including a quick kick during the [[Million Dollar Game]] (that particular kick, executed by San Francisco on a third-and-31 play, succeeded in taking Los Angeles off-guard, but the kick also backfired as the Demons could not recover the kick and Los Angeles returned it for a touchdown).<ref name=worst>{{cite AV media |author=Bulkema, Will |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pRFTLDtgeQ | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/9pRFTLDtgeQ| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live|title=The only XFL championship was also the worst |publisher=[[SB Nation]] |date=February 7, 2019 |medium=video |via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n===Play clock===\nThe XFL used a [[play clock]] of 35&nbsp;seconds from the end of the previous play, five seconds shorter than the contemporary NFL play clock of 40&nbsp;seconds (but still longer than the CFL's 20&nbsp;seconds, timed from the spotting of the football), in an effort to speed up the game.\n\n===Roster and salaries===\nThe XFL limited each team to an unusually low 38&nbsp;players, as opposed to 53 on [[National Football League|NFL]] teams and 80 or more on unlimited college rosters. This was similar to the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], which had a comparable 40&nbsp;man roster limit in 2001. This was partly to limit payroll costs, and partly because the XFL wanted to curb the use of \"specialists,\" something which the NFL has sometimes come under criticism for. To comply with roster limits, most teams only carried two quarterbacks and one kicker who doubled as the punter.\n\nThe XFL paid standardized player salaries. [[Quarterback]]s earned US$5,000 per week, kickers earned $3,500, and all other uniformed players earned $4,500 per week, though a few players got around these restrictions ([[Los Angeles Xtreme]] players [[Noel Prefontaine]], the league's lone [[punter (football)|punting specialist]], and Matt Malloy, a wide receiver) by having themselves listed as backup quarterbacks. Players on a winning team received a bonus of $2,500 for the week, $7,500 for winning a [[playoff game]]. The team that won the championship game split $1,000,000 (roughly $25,000 per player). Players did not receive any fringe benefits, and had to pay for their own [[health insurance]].\n\n===Jersey nicknames===\nThe XFL allowed its players to wear a nickname on the back of their jersey, as opposed to the legal last name most professional sports leagues have required since the 1960s. Players could change the nickname any time they wanted, and a few players chose to change the nicknames on a weekly basis depending on their opponent. The league's use of [[#Skycam and Bubba Cam|backfield camera angles]] gave these nicknames even greater exposure. Nevertheless, two teams, Orlando<ref name=letsplayfootball>{{cite web |url=http://www.pressconnects.com/story/sports/college/purdue/football/2017/07/27/lets-play-football-follows-purdues-jeff-brohm/514924001/ |title=Jeff Brohm's XFL mic drop moment follows him to Purdue |agency=Gannett News Service |first=Mike |last=Carmin |date=July 27, 2017 |access-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> and Birmingham, imposed policies that forbade players from using nicknames. Orlando's ban was voted upon by the players, although Jeff Brohm objected. Birmingham's players were banned from doing so by coach [[Gerry DiNardo]], a notoriously strict disciplinarian more accustomed to coaching at the college level. DiNardo previously alienated players at [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] and [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] and later did so at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]] with his iron-fisted rule. The Thunderbolts were the only professional team he would ever coach.\n\n[[Rod Smart]], a running back who played in the first XFL nationally televised game, was the first player to gain notice from his nickname, \"He Hate Me.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/11/mlb-players-weekend-nickname-jerseys-age |title=MLB's nickname gimmick won't solve baseball's mounting age issues |newspaper=The Guardian |place=UK |date=2017-08-11 |access-date=August 11, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Fans love 'He Hate Me'\"/>\n\n==Broadcast overview==\n\n===Camera perspectives===\nAlthough the XFL was not the first football league to feature the \"[[skycam|sky cam]]\",<ref name=skycam>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/07/sports/sp-22325 |title=XFL, NBC Working Out Kinks |author=Stewart, Larry |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=March 10, 2009 |date=February 7, 2001}}</ref> which enables TV viewers to see behind the offensive unit, it helped to popularize its unique capabilities. For the first several weeks, the league used the sky cam and on-field cameramen (nicknamed the \"Bubba Cam\" after WWE's cameraman, Bubba, who couldn't get medical clearance to cover the XFL)<ref name=skycam2>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2011/05/16/Leagues-and-Governing-Bodies/XFL-Bubba-Cam.aspx |title=Bubba Cam put cameraman into the game |author=Tefton, Terry |work=Sports Business Daily |publisher=[[American City Business Journals]] |access-date=May 17, 2011 |date=May 16, 2011}}</ref> extensively, giving the television broadcasts a perspective similar to [[video game]]s such as the ''[[Madden NFL|Madden]]'' series.\n\nDuring player interviews, particularly later in the season as attendances declined, the television crews took extensive efforts to avoid capturing the empty stands on camera. When they did show the stands, it was just mostly close ups of individual sections that were full. Player interviews at sparsely-attended games were often shot from a camera angle in close proximity and low to the ground pointed upward, giving the perspective of the [[UHF (film)|camera being operated by a little person]].<ref>{{Citation|title=The only XFL championship was also the worst|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pRFTLDtgeQ|language=en|access-date=2022-01-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter the XFL's failure, the sky cam was adopted by the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s broadcasters; the device has subsequently come into use on all major networks. NBC in particular switched back to the XFL camera angles in [[2017 NFL season|2017]], when traditional cameras were too far away to cut through thick fog and smoke on some of the ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' games that year; response was so positive that the network opted to use two of its ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' games to experiment with intentionally broadcasting most of the game through that angle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/nfl/index.ssf/2017/11/nbcs_skycam_will_provide_madde.html |title=NBC's 'skycam' will provide Madden-like view of tonight's Titans-Steelers game |date=November 17, 2017 |publisher=Portland Oregonian |via=oregonlive.com}}</ref>\n\n===Broadcast schedule===\nAt the beginning of the season, NBC showed a feature game at 8&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on Saturday nights, also taping a second game. The second game, in some weeks, would air in the visiting team's home market (as was the case in week 6 for the Enforcers-Maniax game, and in week 7, for the Maniax-Hitmen game) and be put on the air nationally if the feature game was a blowout (as was the case in week one) or encountered technical difficulties (as was the case in week two). Two games were shown each Sunday: one at 4&nbsp;p.m. Eastern on [[Paramount Network#The National Network, the New TNN, and professional wrestling (2000–2003)|TNN]] and another at 7&nbsp;p.m. Eastern on [[UPN]]. The XFL also had a fairly extensive local radio presence, often using nationally recognized disc jockeys. The morning radio duo of [[Rick and Bubba]], for instance, was the radio broadcast team for the [[Birmingham Thunderbolts]]. [[Super Dave Osborne]] was a sideline reporter for Los Angeles Xtreme broadcasts on [[KNX-FM|KLSX]]; [[WMVP]] carried Chicago Enforcers games.\n\nUnusually for a professional league, the XFL did not feature a studio wraparound. The network offered ''XFL Gameday'', a pregame show featuring radio shock jocks [[Opie and Anthony]] for the first four weeks of the season, but the show was not carried nationwide and most affiliates joined in just before the game. Halftime consisted mostly of live look-ins into the player locker rooms, as coaches discussed their strategy and halftime adjustments with their players, as well as cheerleader performances. The XFL also, at McMahon's request, followed a somewhat different format than traditional professional football telecasts: The announcers more closely followed the model of professional wrestling where the [[color commentator]] had a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain-like role]], while the [[sideline reporter]]s (who were predominantly male, a rare example of the XFL being more ''conservative'' than the NFL at the time, which was incorporating attractive female sideline reporters) were former players and experienced sportscasters who were relied upon for more expert analysis than usual.\n\nIn the third week of the season, the games were sped up through changes in the playing rules, and broadcasts were subjected to increased time constraints. The reason was the reaction of [[Lorne Michaels]], creator and executive producer of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', to the length of the [[Los Angeles Xtreme]] versus [[Chicago Enforcers]] game that went into double overtime. The double overtime periods combined with a power outage earlier in the game due to someone not fueling a generator before the game delayed the contest, causing the start of ''Saturday Night Live'' to be pushed back from 11:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time to 12:15&nbsp;a.m. Sunday morning.{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=172}} This angered Michaels, who expected high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] with [[Jennifer Lopez]] as the show's host.{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=172}} For the rest of the season, the XFL cut off coverage at 11:00 Eastern Time, regardless of whether or not the game was over (there were exceptions, for the Chicago and Memphis markets for the Enforcers-Maniax game in week 6, and in New York and Memphis markets for the Maniax-Hitmen game in week 7). NBC Sports has retained this policy for other sports it runs in Saturday night time slots since the XFL's closure; in 2018, [[2018 NHL Stadium Series|a National Hockey League telecast]] was cut off under similar circumstances.<ref name=\"USA Today\">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/03/03/lights-temporarily-go-out-navy-stadium-delaying-play-between-capitals-maple-leafs/392928002/ |title=Lights temporarily go out at Navy stadium, delaying play between Capitals, Maple Leafs |newspaper=USA Today |date=March 3, 2018 |access-date=March 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the face of declining ratings, NBC and the XFL aggressively promoted that the week&nbsp;6 game between the Orlando Rage and Las Vegas Outlaws would feature a behind-the-scenes visit into the locker room of the Rage's cheerleaders at halftime. The heavily promoted event was actually a kayfabe [[sketch comedy|sketch]] with McMahon and a cameraman, who knocks himself unconscious on the locker room door trying to run in. This was followed by a suggestive [[dream sequence]] with the cheerleaders, including a surprise cameo by [[Rodney Dangerfield]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.gq.com/story/xfl-culture-wars |title=Vince McMahon Is Bringing Back the XFL and Diving into the Culture Wars |publisher=Condé Nast |magazine=GQ |language=en |access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> The ''New York Daily News'' reported that the scene would likely be the \"[last] salacious WWF-style stunt for the rest of the season\", citing internal sources indicating that NBC wished to pivot the telecasts back towards a football-oriented product, including hiring NFL alumni as analysts, and reinstating Vasgersian as the lead commentator.<ref name=\"nydn-cheerleaders\">{{cite news |title=XFL stops going to extremes |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/xfl-stops-extremes-article-1.916919 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman|Daily News L.P.]] |access-date=March 11, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"espn-slidebarely\">{{cite web |title=XFL ends ratings slide – just barely |url=http://www.espn.com/otherfb/xfl/news/2001/0311/1147486.html |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Inc. |access-date=March 11, 2017}}</ref>{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=173}}\n\n===Broadcast teams===\n[[File:JR and The King No Mercy 07.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jerry Lawler]] and [[Jim Ross]] came over from WWF to fill similar roles on XFL broadcasts.]]\n* '''NBC (national telecasts)''':\n** Week 1, 6–10: [[Matt Vasgersian]], [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Fred Roggin]] and [[Mike Adamle]].

The existing PA sound systems in the football stadiums could not provide the audio levels required for the desired experience. To attain the this experience the XFL used a custom speaker support system designed by Maryland Sound International. This \"Hi-Sonic Speaker Support Pole\" could support heavier and louder speaker systems akin to the type that are used for larger music concerts. The speaker pole system was placed at the corners of the field and served to bring the sound down to the field level so the fans could really experience the game. <ref>{{Citation|title=MSI CUSTOM HI SONIC SPEAKER SUPPORT SYSTEM|url=https://www.marylandsound.com/services/msi-custom-hi-sonic-speaker-support-system}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nIt was believed that the willingness of Las Vegas bookmakers to take bets on XFL games established their legitimacy, dispelling concerns that the league was using predetermined storylines as in professional wrestling.<ref name=\"sentinel-betting\">{{cite web |title=XFL bets on gambling to bring out fans |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-02-03/news/0102030271_1_bookies-football-league-las-vegas |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |publisher=Tribune Publishing |access-date=March 10, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"mentalfloss-xfl\">{{cite web |title=Good, Honest Football: Re-Watching the XFL |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/58829/good-honest-football-re-watching-xfl |website=[[Mental Floss]] |date=September 18, 2014 |access-date=March 10, 2017}}</ref> However, the league was panned by critics as boring football with a tawdry broadcast style, although the broadcasts on [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] and to a lesser extent [[UPN]] and the [[Matt Vasgersian]]–helmed NBC coverage were considered comparatively professional.{{sfn|Forrest|2002|p=59}}\n\n==End of season and failure==\nOn April 21, 2001, the season concluded as the [[Los Angeles Xtreme]] defeated the [[San Francisco Demons]] 38–6 in the XFL Championship Game (which was originally given the moniker \"The Big Game at the End of the Season\", but was later dubbed the [[Million Dollar Game]], after the amount of money awarded to the winning team, which if divided, gave each player less than the losing team in the [[Pro Bowl]]).\n\nThough paid attendance at games remained respectable, if unimpressive (overall attendance was only 10% below what the league's goal had been at the start of the season), the XFL ceased operations after just one season due to low television ratings.<ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite web |title=WWF drops XFL |url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/05/10/news/xfl/ |work=[[CNNMoney]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |date=May 10, 2001 |access-date=October 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |last=Sandomir |first=Richard|title=No More Springtimes for the XFL as League Folds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/11/sports/pro-football-no-more-springtimes-for-the-xfl-as-league-folds.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 11, 2001 |access-date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> Facing stiff competition from the [[2001 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|NCAA basketball tournament]], the NBC telecast of the Chicago/NY-NJ game on March&nbsp;31 received a 1.5 rating, at that time the lowest ever for any major network [[primetime]] weekend first-run sports television broadcast in the United States.{{sfn|Forrest|2002|p=211}} During the season, many news and sports networks (even local networks within XFL cities) did not show highlights or even report scores.

(This actual chip manufactured in 1990.)]] \n[[File:Z84C0010FEC LQFP.png|thumb|A [[CMOS]] Z80 in a [[quad flat package]]]]\n\n===Early history===\n[[Physicist]] and [[engineer]] Federico Faggin worked at [[Intel]] on [[microprocessor]] design. At [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], and later at Intel, Faggin had been working on fundamental [[transistor]] and [[semiconductor]] manufacturing technology. He also developed the basic design methodology used for memories and microprocessors at Intel and led the work on the [[Intel 4004]], the [[Intel 8080]] and several other ICs. [[Masatoshi Shima]] was the principal logic and transistor-level designer of the 4004 and the 8080 under Faggin's supervision, while [[Ralph Ungermann]] was in charge of custom [[integrated circuit]] design.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=1}}\n\nIn early 1974, Intel viewed their microprocessors not so much as products to be sold on their own but as a way to sell more of their main products, [[static RAM]] and [[ROM]]. A reorganization placed many of the formerly independent sections under the direction of Les Vadasz, further diluting the microprocessor's place in the company. That year, the [[1973–1975 recession]] reached a peak and Intel laid off a number of employees.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=1}} All of this led to Faggin becoming restless, and he invited Ungermann out for drinks and asked if he would be interested in starting their own company. Ungermann immediately agreed, and as he had less to do at Intel, left in August or September, followed by Faggin, whose last day at Intel was Halloween 1974.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=2}} When Shima heard, he asked to come to the new company as well, but having no actual product design or money, they told him to wait.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=3}}\n\nThe newly-formed and unnamed company initially began designing a single-chip [[microcontroller]] called the 2001. They met with [[Synertek]] to discuss fabrication on their lines, and when Faggin began to understand the costs involved it became clear that a low-cost product like this would not be able to compete with a design from a company with its own production lines, like Intel. They then began considering a more complex microprocessor instead, initially known as the Super 80, with the main feature being its use of a +5&nbsp;V bus{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=3}} instead of the more common -5, +5 and 12&nbsp;V used by designs like the 8080. The new design was intended to be compatible with the 8080, but add many of the nice features of the [[Motorola 6800]], including [[index register]]s and improved interrupts.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=4}}\n\n===Exxon investment, detailed development begins===\nWhile still being set up, the industry newsletter ''Electronic News'' heard of them and published a story on the newly formed company. This attracted the attention of Exxon Enterprises, [[Exxon]]'s high-tech investment arm. At the time, in the midst of the recession, there was very little [[venture capital]] available, with a total of $10 million for the entire industry being spent in all of 1975 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|10|1975}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}). Someone from Exxon contacted the still-unnamed company,{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=3}} and arranged a meeting that eventually led to them providing an initial $500,000 funding in June 1975 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.5|1975|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=8}}\n\nWith funding being discussed, and a design to be built, Shima joined in February 1975.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=4}} Shima immediately set about producing a high-level design, adding several concepts of his own. In particular, he used his experience on [[NEC]] [[minicomputer]]s to add the concept of two sets of [[processor register]]s so they could quickly respond to [[interrupt]]s.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=2}}{{efn-lr|This was a fairly common feature of minicomputer designs of the era, and found its way into a number of early microprocessors.}} Ungerman began the development of a series of related controllers and peripheral chips that would complement the design.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=5}}\n\nThrough this period, Shima developed a legendary reputation for being able to convert logic concepts into physical design in realtime; while discussing a proposed feature, he would often interrupt and state how much room that would take on the chip and veto its addition if it was too large.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=19}} The first pass at the design was complete by April 1975. Shima had completed a logic layout by the beginning of May. A second version of the logic design was issued on 7 August and the bus details by 16 September. Tape-out was completed in November and converting the tape into a production mask required two more months.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=6}}\n\nFaggin had already started looking for a production partner. By this time, Synertek and [[Mostek]] had both set up the depletion-mode production lines that could be used to produce the design. Having talked to Synertek previously, Faggin approached them first. However, the president of Synertek demanded that the company be given a [[second source]] license, allowing them to sell the design directly. Faggin thought this would mean they could never compete even if they set up their own lines, and the agreement fell through. He then turned to Mostek, who agreed to a term of exclusivity while Zilog got their lines set up, and were eventually given the second source agreement.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=7}}\n\nAfter considering many names for the new company, and finding them so unmemorable they could not recall them even a day later, Faggin and Ungermann were kicking around ideas based on \"integrated logic\" when Ungermann said \"how about Zilog?\" Faggin immediately agreed, stating they could say it was the \"last word in integrated logic\". When they met the next day and both immediately recalled it, the company had its name.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=17}}\n\n===Into production===\nThe first samples were returned from Mostek on 9 March 1976.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=5}} By the end of the month, they had also completed an [[assembler (computing)|assembler]]-based [[microprocessor development board|development system]]. Some of the Z80 support and peripheral ICs were under development at this point, and many of them were launched during the following year. Among them were the Z80 CTC (counter/timer), Z80 DMA (direct memory access), Z80 DART (dual asynchronous receiver–transmitter), Z80 SIO (synchronous communication controller), and Z80 PIO (parallel input/output).\n\nThe Z80 was officially launched in July 1976.{{sfnp|Anderson|1994|p=51}} One of the very first customers was a buyer who, unknown to Zilog, worked for NEC. At the time, the Japanese electronics companies were well known for taking US chip designs and producing them without a license. The Zilog team had worried about this, and Faggin had come up with the idea of adding transistors that would be subtly modified to operate differently than a visual inspection would suggest. Shima added six of these \"traps\" around the design. Sometime later, Shima was told by an engineer within NEC that the traps had delayed their copying efforts by six months.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=13}}\n\nThe successful launch allowed Faggin and Ungermann to approach Exxon looking for funding to build their own fab. The company agreed, and Zilog built a production line very rapidly. This allowed them to capture about 60 to 70% of the total market for Z80 sales.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=9}} With their own line running, Mostek was given the go-ahead to start sales of their own versions, the MK3880, which provided a second-source for customers which Intel lacked. At the time, a second-source was considered extremely important as a start-up like Zilog might go out of business and leave potential customers stranded.{{sfn|Faggin|Shima|Ungermann|2007|p=4}}{{efn-lr|Zilog manufactured the Z80 as well as most of their other products for many years until they sold their [[manufacturing plant]]s and become the \"[[fabless]]\" company they are today.}}\n\n===Comparison with the 8080===\nFaggin designed the [[instruction set]] to be [[binary-code compatibility|binary compatible]] with the 8080{{sfnp|Anderson|1994|p=57}}<ref name=\"brock\">{{cite book | title = The second information revolution | last = Brock | first = Gerald W. | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-674-01178-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/secondinformatio0000broc | url-access = registration}}</ref> so that most 8080 code, notably the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]] and Intel's [[PL/M]] compiler for 8080 (as well as its generated code), would run unmodified on the new Z80 CPU.

The Z80 could use memory with the same range of access times as the 8080 (or the 8086) at the same clock frequency.

Likewise, [[Zenith Data Systems]] paired the 8085 with the 16-bit [[Intel&nbsp;8088]] in its first MS-DOS computer, the [[Zenith Z-100]], despite having previous experience with its pioneering Z80-based [[Zenith Z-89|Heathkit&nbsp;H89 and Zenith&nbsp;Z-89]] products. However, other computers were made integrating the Z80 with other CPUs: the Radio Shack [[TRS-80 Model II#Model 16|TRS-80 Model&nbsp;16]] with a [[Motorola 68000]], the [[DEC Rainbow]] with an 8088, and the [[Commodore&nbsp;128]] with a [[MOS&nbsp;8502]].\n\nZilog was later producing a low-power Z80 suitable for the growing laptop computer market of the early 1980s. Intel produced a CMOS 8085 (80C85) used in battery-powered portable computers, such as the [[Kyocera]]-designed laptop from April 1983, also sold by Tandy (as [[TRS-80 Model&nbsp;100]]), Olivetti, and NEC. In following years, however, CMOS versions of the Z80 (from both Zilog and Japanese manufacturers) would dominate this market as well, in products such as the [[Amstrad NC100]], [[Cambridge&nbsp;Z88]] and Tandy's own WP-2.\n\nPerhaps a key to the initial success of the Z80 was the built-in DRAM refresh, at least in markets such as [[CP/M]] and other office and home computers. (Most Z80 [[embedded system]]s use [[static RAM]] that do not need refresh.) It may also have been its minimalistic two-level interrupt system, or conversely, its general multi-level daisy-chain interrupt system useful in servicing multiple Z80 IO chips. These features allowed systems to be built with less support hardware and simpler circuit board layouts. \n\nHowever, others claim that its popularity was due to the duplicated registers that allowed fast context switches or more efficient processing of things like floating-point math compared to 8-bit CPUs with fewer registers. (The Z80 can keep several such numbers internally, using HL'HL, DE'DE and BC'BC as 32-bits registers, avoiding having to access them from slower RAM during computation.)<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.andreadrian.de/oldcpu/Z80_number_cruncher.html#mozTocId228550 |title=Z80, the 8-bit Number Cruncher }}</ref> \n\nFor the original [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] design, the specified upper clock-frequency limit increased successively from the introductory 2.5&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], via the well known 4&nbsp;MHz (Z80A), up to 6 (Z80B) and 8&nbsp;MHz (Z80H).<ref>{{cite book | title = Popular Computing | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | date = 1983 | page = 15}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |magazine= [[InfoWorld]] | last = Markoff| first=John | title = Zilog's speedy Z80 soups up 8-bit to 16-bit performance | publisher = InfoWorld Media Group | date =1982-10-18 | page = 1 | issn = 0199-6649}}</ref> The NMOS version has been produced as a 10&nbsp;MHz part since the late 1980s.

It is the PC and IR registers that are placed in a separate group, with a detachable bus segment, to allow updates of these registers in parallel with the main register bank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.righto.com/2014/10/how-z80s-registers-are-implemented-down.html|title=Down to the silicon: how the Z80's registers are implemented}}</ref>]]\n\nThe programming model and register set of the Z80 are fairly conventional, ultimately based on the register structure of the [[Datapoint 2200]]. The Z80 was designed as an extension of the Intel 8080, created by the same engineers, which in turn was an extension of the [[Intel 8008|8008]]. The 8008 was basically a [[PMOS logic|PMOS]] implementation of the TTL-based CPU of the Datapoint 2200.{{efn-lr|The related [[Intel 8086|8086]] family also inherited this register design.}}\n\nThe 2200 design allowed 8-bit registers H and L (High and Low) to be paired into a 16-bit address register HL.{{efn-lr|This variable HL pointer was actually the only way to access memory (for data) in the Datapoint 2200, and hence also in the Intel 8008. No direct addresses could be used to access data.}} In the 8080, this pairing was added to the BC and DE pairs as well, while HL was generalized to allow use as a 16-bit accumulator, not just an address register. The 8080 also introduced the important 8-bit immediate data mode for accumulator operations, and immediate 16-bit data for HL, BC and DE loads. Furthermore, direct 16-bit copying between HL and memory was now possible, using a direct address.\n\nThe Z80 [[Orthogonal instruction set|orthogonalized]] this further by making all 16-bit register pairs, including IX and IY, more general purpose, as well as allowing 16-bit copying directly to and from memory for all of these pairs. The 16-bit IX and IY registers in the Z80 are primarily intended as base address-registers, where a particular instruction supplies a constant offset that is added to the previous values, but they are also usable as 16-bit accumulators, among other things. A limitation is that all operand references involving IX or IY require an extra instruction prefix byte, adding at least four clock cycles over the timing of an instruction using HL instead; this sometimes makes using IX or IY less efficient than a method using only the 8080-model registers. The Z80 also introduced a new signed [[overflow flag]] and complemented the fairly simple 16-bit arithmetics of the 8080 with dedicated instructions for ''signed'' 16-bit arithmetics.\n\nThe 8080-compatible registers AF, BC, DE, HL are duplicated as a separate register file in the Z80,<ref>{{cite book | title = Kilobaud | publisher = 1001001 | date= 1977 | page = 22 }}</ref> where the processor can quickly (four t-states, the least possible execution time for any Z80 instruction)  switch from one bank to the other;<ref>{{cite book |last = Zaks |first = Rodnay |title=Programming the Z80 |edition=3rd |publisher=SYBEX |date= 1982 |isbn = 978-0-89588-069-7 |page = 62 |url = https://archive.org/details/Programming_The_Z80_Third_Edition_Rodnay_Zaks/}}</ref> a feature useful for speeding up responses to single-level, high-priority interrupts. A similar feature was present in the 2200, but was never implemented at Intel. The dual register-set is very useful in the embedded role, as it improves interrupt handling performance, but found widespread use in the personal computer role as an additional set of general registers for complex code like [[floating-point arithmetic]] or home computer games.\n\nThe duplicate register file is often referred to as the \"alternate register set\" (by some, the \"primed\" register file since the apostrophe character is used to denote them in assembler source code and the Zilog documentation). This emphasizes that only one set is addressable at any time. However, the 8-bit accumulator A with its flag register F is bifurcated from the \"general purpose\" register pairs HL, DE and BC. This is accomplished with two separate instructions used to swap their accessibilities: <code>EX AF,AF'</code> exchanges only register pair AF with AF', while the <code>EXX</code> instruction exchanges the three general purpose register pairs HL, DE and BC with their alternates HL', DE' and BC'. Thus the accumulator A can interact independently with any of the general purpose 8-bit registers in the alternate (or primed) register file, or, if HL' contains a pointer to memory, some byte there (DE' and BC' can also transfer 8-bit data between memory and accumulator A).\n\nThis can become confusing for programmers because after executing <code>EX AF,AF'</code> or <code>EXX</code> what were previously the alternate (primed) registers are now the main registers, and vice versa. The only way for the programmer to tell which set(s) are in context (while \"playing computer\" while scrutinizing the assembler source text, or worse, poring over code with a debugger) is to trace where each register swap is made at each point in the program. Obviously if many jump and calls are made within these code segments it can quickly become difficult to tell which register file is in context unless carefully commented. Thus it is advisable that exchange instructions be used directly and in short discrete code segments. The Zilog Z280 instruction set includes <code>JAF</code> and <code>JAR</code> instructions which jump to a destination address if the alternate registers are in context (thus officially recognizing this programming complication).\n\n====Registers====\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%;width:32em;\"\n|-\n|+ Zilog Z80 registers\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:10px;

This has sometimes been used to generate [[pseudorandom]] numbers in games, and also in software protection schemes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} It has also been employed as a \"hardware\" counter in some designs; an example of this is the [[ZX81]], which lets it keep track of character positions on the TV screen by triggering an interrupt at [[integer overflow|wrap around]] (by connecting INT to A6).\n\nThe ''interrupt vector register'', <code>I</code>, is used for the Z80 specific mode 2 interrupts (selected by the <code>IM 2</code> instruction). It supplies the high byte of the base address for a 128-entry table of [[interrupt service routine|service routine]] addresses which are selected via an index sent to the CPU during an [[interrupt]] acknowledge cycle; this index is simply the low byte part of the pointer to the tabulated indirect address pointing to the service routine.<ref name=\"interruptmodes\" /> The pointer identifies a particular peripheral chip or peripheral function or event, where the chips are normally connected in a so-called [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] for priority resolution. Like the refresh register, this register has also sometimes been used creatively; in interrupt modes 0 and 1 (or in a system not using interrupts) it can be used as simply another 8-bit data register.\n\nThe instructions <code>LD A,R</code> and <code>LD A,I</code> affect the Z80 flags register, unlike all the other <code>LD</code> (load) instructions. The Sign (bit 7) and Zero (bit 6) flags are set according to the data loaded from the Refresh or Interrupt source registers. For both instructions, the Parity/Overflow flag (bit 2) is set according to the current state of the IFF2 flip-flop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Z80 Flag Affection|url=http://www.z80.info/z80sflag.htm|website=z80.info|publisher=Thomas Scherrer|access-date=2016-06-14}}</ref>\n\n====Microarchitecture====\nAlthough the Z80 is generally considered an eight-bit CPU, it has a four-bit [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], so calculations are done in two cycles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.righto.com/2013/09/the-z-80-has-4-bit-alu-heres-how-it.html|title=The Z-80 has a 4-bit ALU.

This original syntax was later transformed into a new, somewhat more traditional, assembly language form for this same original 8008 chip. At about the same time, the new assembly language was also extended to accommodate the additional addressing modes in the more advanced Intel 8080 chip (the 8008 and 8080 shared a language subset without being [[binary-code compatibility|binary compatible]]; however, the 8008 was binary compatible with the Datapoint 2200).\n\nIn this process, the mnemonic <code>L</code>, for ''LOAD'', was replaced by various abbreviations of the words ''LOAD'', ''STORE'' and ''MOVE'', intermixed with other symbolic letters. The mnemonic letter <code>M</code>, for ''memory'' (referenced by HL), was lifted out from within the instruction mnemonic to become a syntactically freestanding ''operand'', while registers and combinations of registers became very inconsistently denoted; either by abbreviated operands (MVI D, LXI H and so on), within the instruction mnemonic itself (LDA, LHLD and so on), or both at the same time (LDAX B, STAX D and so on).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is possible because the operands themselves carry enough information.\n\nThese principles made it straightforward to find names and forms for all new Z80 instructions, as well as [[orthogonalization]]s of old ones, such as <code>LD BC,(1234)</code>.\n\nApart from naming differences, and despite a certain discrepancy in basic register structure, the Z80 and [[Intel 8086|8086]] syntax are virtually [[isomorphic]] for a large portion of instructions. Only quite superficial similarities (such as the word MOV, or the letter X, for extended register) exist between the 8080 and 8086 assembly languages, although 8080 programs can be translated to 8086 assembly language by [[Assembly language translator|translator program]]s.<ref name=\"Scanlon_1988\"/><ref name=\"Nelson_1988\"/>\n\n===Instruction set and encoding===\nThe Z80 uses 252 out of the available 256 codes as single byte opcodes (\"root instruction\" which are all inherited from the 8080); the four remaining codes are used extensively as [[opcode prefix]]es:<ref name=\"instructions\">{{cite web | url = http://www.z80.info/z80brief.htm | title = Z80 CPU Introduction | publisher = Zilog | date = 1995 | quote = It has a language of 252 root instructions and with the reserved 4 bytes as prefixes, accesses an additional 308 instructions. }}</ref> CB and ED enable extra instructions, and DD or FD select IX+d or IY+d respectively (in some cases without displacement d) in place of HL.

Shift instructions can also multiply or divide by powers of two.\n\nDifferent sizes and variants of additions, shifts, and rotates have somewhat differing effects on flags because most of the flag-changing properties of the 8080 were copied. However, the parity flag bit&nbsp;P of the 8080 (bit&nbsp;2) is called P/V (parity/overflow) in the Z80 as it serves the additional purpose of a twos complement overflow indicator, a feature lacking in the 8080. Arithmetic instructions on the Z80 set it to indicate overflow rather than parity, while bitwise instructions still use it as a parity flag. (This introduces a subtle incompatibility of the Z80 with code written for the 8080, as the Z80 sometimes indicates signed overflow where the 8080 would indicate parity, possibly causing the logic of some practical 8080 software to fail on the Z80.{{efn-lr|For example, on the 8080, a programmer might test the parity of a byte by {{code|ADD}}ing zero to it, by {{code|SUB}}tracting zero from it, or by {{code|OR}}ing or {{code|XOR}}ing it with zero; all of these are single-instruction operations of the same speed and size, on both the 8080 and the Z80. If the programmer happened to choose to test parity by {{code|OR}}ing or {{code|XOR}}ing with zero, then the Z80 will execute the program correctly, but if the programmer chose to test parity by {{code|ADD}}ing or {{code|SUB}}tracting zero, then the Z80 will always reset the P/V flag to zero (since adding or subtracting zero never causes an overflow or underflow) instead of assigning P to correctly indicate the parity of the byte (as the 8080&mdash;or 8085&mdash;would), and the program may fail. Nothing in the Intel programming manuals or other documentation for the 8080 discouraged use of arithmetic instructions, or prescribed using logical instructions, to test parity, so there is no reason that an 8080 programmer exercising recommended good programming practice should be expected to have chosen one of the ways that will work on the Z80 over one of the ways that will not work.}}) This new overflow flag is used for all new Z80-specific 16-bit operations ({{code|ADC}}, {{code|SBC}}) as well as for 8-bit arithmetic operations, while the 16-bit operations inherited from the 8080 ({{code|ADD}}, {{code|INC}}, {{code|DEC}}) do not affect it. Also, bit&nbsp;1 of the flags register (a spare bit on the 8080) is used as a flag&nbsp;N that indicates whether the last arithmetic instruction executed was a subtraction or addition. The Z80 version of the {{code|DAA}} instruction (decimal adjust accumulator for BCD arithmetic) checks the N&nbsp;flag and behaves accordingly, so a (hypothetical) subtraction followed later by {{code|DAA}} will yield a different result on an old 8080 than on the Z80. However, this would likely be erroneous code on the 8080, as {{code|DAA}} was defined for addition only on that processor.\n\nThe Z80 has six new {{code|LD}} instructions that can load the DE, BC, and SP register pairs from memory, and load memory from these three register pairs—unlike the 8080.<ref>{{cite web|title=8080/Z80 Instruction Sets|url=http://nemesis.lonestar.org/computers/tandy/software/apps/m4/qd/opcodes.html|website=Quick and Dirty 8080 Assembler|publisher=Frank Durda|access-date=2016-07-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211094642/http://nemesis.lonestar.org/computers/tandy/software/apps/m4/qd/opcodes.html|archive-date=2016-02-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> As on the 8080, load instructions do not affect the flags (except for the special-purpose I and R register loads). A result of a regular encoding (common with the 8080) is that each of the 8-bit registers can be loaded from themselves (e.g. {{code|LD A,A}}). This is effectively a {{code|NOP}}.\n\nNew block transfer instructions can move up to 64&nbsp;kilobytes from memory to memory or between memory and I/O peripheral ports. Block instructions {{code|LDIR}} and {{code|LDDR}} ('''l'''oa'''d''', '''i'''ncrement/'''d'''ecrement, '''r'''epeat) use HL to point to the source address, DE to the destination address, and BC as a byte counter. Bytes are copied from source to destination, the pointers are incremented or decremented, and the byte counter is decremented until BC reaches zero. Non-repeating versions {{code|LDI}} and {{code|LDD}} move a single byte and bump the pointers and byte counter, which if it becomes zero resets the P/V&nbsp;flag. Corresponding memory-to-I/O instructions {{code|INIR}}, {{code|INDR}}, {{code|OTIR}}, {{code|OTDR}}, {{code|INI}}, {{code|IND}}, {{code|OUTI}} and {{code|OUTD}} operate similarly, except that B, not BC, is used as the byte counter.{{sfnp|Ciarcia|1981|p=86}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Computer Architecture and Organization |last=HAYES |first=JOHN P. |isbn=0-07-027363-4 |year=1978 |p=423}}</ref> The Z80 can input and output any register to an I/O port using register&nbsp;C to designate the port. (The 8080 only performs I/O through the accumulator&nbsp;A, using a direct port address specified in the instruction; a self-modifying code technique is required to use a variable 8080 port address.)\n\nThe last group of block instructions perform a {{code|CP}} compare operation between the byte at (HL) and the accumulator&nbsp;A. Register pair DE is not used. The repeating versions {{code|CPIR}} and {{code|CPDR}} only terminate if BC goes to zero or a match is found. HL is left pointing to the byte after ({{code|CPIR}}) or before ({{code|CPDR}}) the matching byte. If no match is found the Z&nbsp;flag is reset. There are non-repeating versions {{code|CPI}} and {{code|CPD}}.\n\nUnlike the 8080, the Z80 can jump to a relative address ({{code|JR}} instead of {{code|JP}}) using a signed 8-bit displacement. Only the zero and carry flags can be tested for these new two-byte {{code|JR}} instructions. (All 8080 jumps and calls, conditional or not, are three-byte instructions.) A two-byte instruction specialized for program looping is also new to the Z80: {{code|DJNZ}} ('''d'''ecrement '''j'''ump if '''n'''on-'''z'''ero) takes a signed 8-bit displacement as an immediate operand. The B&nbsp;register is decremented, and if the result is nonzero, then program execution jumps relative to PC; the flags remain unaltered. To perform an equivalent loop on an 8080 requires separate {{code|DEC}} and conditional jump (to a two-byte absolute address) instructions (totalling four bytes), and the {{code|DEC}} alters the flag register.\n\nThe index register (IX/IY, often abbreviated XY) instructions can be useful for accessing data organised in fixed heterogenous structures (such as [[record (computer science)|record]]s) or at fixed offsets relative a variable base address (as in [[recursive]] [[stack frame]]s) and can also reduce code size by removing the need for multiple short instructions using non-indexed registers. However, although they may save speed in some contexts when compared to long/complex \"equivalent\" sequences of simpler operations, they incur a lot of additional CPU time (e.g., 19 T-states to access one indexed memory location vs. as little as 11 to access the same memory using HL and {{code|INC}} to point to the next). Thus, for simple or linear accesses of data, use of IX and IY tend to be slower and occupy more memory. Still, they may be useful in cases where the \"main\" registers are all occupied, by removing the need to save/restore registers. Their officially undocumented 8-bit halves (see below) can be especially useful in this context, for they incur less slowdown than their 16-bit parents. Similarly, instructions for 16-bit additions are not particularly fast (11&nbsp;clocks) in the original Z80 (being 1&nbsp;clock slower than in the 8080/8085); nonetheless, they are about twice as fast as performing the same calculations using 8-bit operations, and equally important, they reduce register usage. It was not uncommon for programmers to \"poke\" different offset displacement bytes (which were typically calculated dynamically) into indexed instructions; this is an example of [[self-modifying code]], which was regular practice on nearly all early 8-bit processors with non-[[Instruction pipelining#Special situations|pipelined]] execution units.\n\nThe index registers have a parallel instruction to {{code|JP (HL)}}, which is {{code|JP (XY)}}. This is often seen in stack-oriented languages like [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], which at the end of every Forth word (atomic subroutines comprising the language) must jump unconditionally back to their thread interpreter routines. Typically this jump instruction appears many hundreds of times in an application, and using {{code|JP (XY)}} rather than {{code|JP THREAD}} saves a byte and two T-states for each occurrence. This naturally makes the index register unavailable for any other use, or else the need to constantly reload it would negate its efficiency.\n\nThe 10-year-newer microcoded [[Z180]] design could initially afford more \"chip area\", permitting a slightly more efficient implementation (using a wider [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], among other things); similar things can be said for the [[Zilog Z800|Z800]], [[Z280]], and [[Z380]]. However, it was not until the fully pipelined [[Zilog eZ80|eZ80]] was launched in 2001 that those instructions finally became approximately as cycle-efficient as it is technically possible to make them, i.e. given the Z80 encodings combined with the capability to do an 8-bit read or write every clock cycle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====Undocumented instructions====\nThe index registers, IX and IY, were intended as flexible 16-bit pointers, enhancing the ability to manipulate memory, stack frames and data structures.

Preceding this two-byte instruction with the IX register's opcode prefix, DD, would instead result in the most significant 8 bits of the IX register being loaded with that same value. A notable exception to this would be instructions similar to {{code|LD H,(IX+d)}} which make use of both the HL and IX or IY registers in the same instruction;<ref name=\"undocz80\" /> in this case the DD prefix is only applied to the (IX+d) portion of the instruction. The halves of the XY registers could also hold operands for 8-bit arithmetic, logical and compare instructions, sparing the regular 8-bit registers for other use. The undocumented ability to increment and decrement the upper half of an index register made it easy to expand the range of the normal indexed instructions, without having to resort to the documented {{code|ADD/SBC XY,DE}} or {{code|ADD/SBC XY,BC}}.\n\nThere are several other undocumented instructions as well.<ref>Robin Nixon ''The Amstrad Notepad Advanced User Guide'', Robin Nixon, 1993, {{ISBN|1-85058-515-6}}, pages 219–223.</ref> Undocumented or [[illegal opcode]]s are not detected by the Z80 and have various effects, some of which are useful. However, as they are not part of the formal definition of the instruction set, different implementations of the Z80 are not guaranteed (or especially likely) to work the same way for every undocumented opcode.\n\n====Bugs====\nThe {{code|OTDR}} instruction does not conform to the Z80 documentation. Both the {{code|OTDR}} and {{code|OTIR}} instructions are supposed to leave the carry (C) flag unmodified. The {{code|OTIR}} instruction operates correctly; however, during the execution of the {{code|OTDR}} instruction, the carry flag takes the results of a spurious compare between the accumulator (A) and the last output of the {{code|OTDR}} instruction.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Example code===\n\nEXAMPLE 1:\nThe following Z80 assembler source code is for a subroutine named HELLO_WORLD. This is an introductory program which will print a message to the video display and then exit.

Important: the example code does not handle the case where the destination block overlaps the source; a serious limitation, but one that is irrelevant for some applications—such as, especially, when the source is in ROM and the destination in RAM, so they can never overlap. The sample code is extremely inefficient, intended to illustrate various instruction types, rather than best practices for speed. The data block is copied one byte at a time, and the data movement and looping logic utilizes 16-bit operations. Furthermore, the Z80 has a single instruction that will execute the entire loop (<code>LDIR</code>).  Note that the assembled code is binary-compatible with the Intel 8080 and 8085 CPUs.\n\n<!--Note: This is not intended to be optimized code, but to illustrate the variety of instructions available on the CPU-->\n{|\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|<syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" highlight=\"13\">\n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n        \n             \n                     \n             \n                     \n                     \n                     \n 1000            \n 1000            \n 1000 78         \n 1001 B1         \n 1002 C8         \n 1003 1A         \n 1004 77         \n 1005 13         \n 1006 23         \n 1007 0B         \n 1008 C3 00 10   \n 100B            \n</syntaxhighlight>\n|<syntaxhighlight lang=\"tasm\" highlight=\"13\">\n ; memcpy --\n ; Copy a block of memory from one location to another.\n ;\n ; Entry registers\n ;      BC - Number of bytes to copy\n ;      DE - Address of source data block\n ;      HL - Address of target data block\n ;\n ; Return registers\n ;      BC - Zero\n\n             org     1000h       ;Origin at 1000h\n memcpy      public\n loop        ld      a,b         ;Test BC,\n             or      c           ;If BC = 0,\n             ret     z           ;Return\n             ld      a,(de)      ;Load A from (DE)\n             ld      (hl),a      ;Store A into (HL)\n             inc     de          ;Increment DE\n             inc     hl          ;Increment HL\n             dec     bc          ;Decrement BC\n             jp      loop        ;Repeat the loop\n             end\n</syntaxhighlight>\n|}\n\n===Instruction execution===\nEach instruction is executed in steps that are usually termed [[machine cycle]]s (M-cycles), each of which can take between three and six clock periods (T-states).<ref>{{cite book | title = Z80 Family CPU User Manual | author = Zilog | publisher = Zilog | date = 2005 | page = 11 |url=http://www.zilog.com/docs/z80/um0080.pdf }}</ref> Each M-cycle corresponds roughly to one memory access or internal operation.

This avoids cumbersome asynchronous logic and makes the control signals behave consistently at a wide range of clock frequencies. It also means that a higher frequency crystal must be used than without this subdivision of machine cycles (approximately 2–3 times higher). It does not imply tighter requirements on [[memory access time]]s, since a high resolution clock allows more precise control of memory timings and so memory can be active in parallel with the CPU to a greater extent, allowing more efficient use of available memory bandwidth.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOne central example of this is that, for [[opcode fetch]], the Z80 combines two full clock cycles into a memory access period (the M1-signal). In the Z80 this signal lasts for a relatively larger part of the typical instruction execution time than in a design such as the [[Motorola 6800|6800]], [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], or similar, where this period would typically last typically 30-40% of a clock cycle.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} With memory chip affordability (i.e. access times around 450-250&nbsp;ns in the 1980s{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}) typically determining the fastest possible access time, this meant that such designs were locked to a significantly longer clock cycle (i.e. lower internal clock speed) than the Z80.\n\nMemory was generally slow compared to the state machine sub-cycles (clock cycles) used in contemporary microprocessors. The shortest machine cycle that could safely be used in embedded designs has therefore often been limited by memory access times, not by the maximum CPU frequency (especially so during the home computer era). However, this relation has slowly changed during the last decades, particularly regarding [[Static random access memory|SRAM]]; cacheless, single-cycle designs such as the eZ80 have therefore become much more meaningful recently.\n\nThe content of the refresh register R is sent out on the lower half of the address bus along with a refresh control signal while the CPU is decoding and executing the fetched instruction. During refresh the contents of the Interrupt register I are sent out on the upper half of the address bus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Z80 User Manual, Special Registers pg. 3|url=http://www.zilog.com/force_download.php?filepath=YUhSMGNEb3ZMM2QzZHk1NmFXeHZaeTVqYjIwdlpHOWpjeTk2T0RBdlZVMHdNRGd3TG5Ca1pnPT0=|website=zilog.com|publisher=Zilog|access-date=2016-06-14}}</ref>\n\n===Compatible peripherals===\nZilog introduced a number of peripheral parts for the Z80, which all support the Z80's interrupt handling system and I/O address space.

While some Z80-based computers such as the [[Osborne 1]] used \"Motorola-style\" [[Memory-mapped I/O|memory mapped input/output]] devices, usually the I/O space was used to address one of the many Zilog peripheral chips compatible with the Z80. Zilog I/O chips supported the Z80's new mode 2 interrupts which simplified interrupt handling for large numbers of peripherals.\n\nThe Z80 was officially described as supporting 16-bit (64&nbsp;KB) memory addressing, and 8-bit (256 ports) I/O-addressing. All I/O instructions actually assert the entire 16-bit address bus.

A designer could choose to decode the entire 16-bit address bus on I/O operations in order to take advantage of this feature, or use the high half of the address bus to select subfeatures of the I/O device. This feature has also been used to minimise decoding hardware requirements, such as in the [[Amstrad CPC]]/[[Amstrad PCW|PCW]] and [[ZX81]].\n\n==Second sources and derivatives==\n\n===Second sources===\nMostek, which produced the first Z80 for Zilog, offered it as [[second-source]] as MK3880.

In [[Romania]] another unlicensed clone could be found, named [[MMN80CPU]] and produced by [[Electronics industry in the Socialist Republic of Romania|Microelectronica]], used in home computers like TIM-S, HC, COBRA.\n\nAlso, several clones of Z80 were created in the [[Soviet Union]], notable ones being the [[T34 (microprocessor)|T34BM1]], also called [[КР1858ВМ1]] (parallelling the Soviet 8080-clone [[KR580VM80A]]).

Notable are the [[TRS-80]] series, including the original model (later retronymed \"Model I\"), [[TRS-80 Model II|Model II]], [[TRS-80 Model III|Model III]], and [[TRS-80 Model 4|Model 4]], which were equipped with a Z80 as their main processor, and some (but not all) other TRS-80 models which used the Z80 as either the main or a secondary processor.  Other notable machines were the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Rainbow 100]], and the [[Seequa Chameleon]], both of which featured both an [[Intel 8088]] and a Z80 CPU, to support either 8-bit CP/M-80 applications running on the Z80, or a custom MS-DOS that was not fully compatible with [[PC DOS]] applications running on the 8088.\n\nIn 1981, Multitech (later to become [[Acer Inc.|Acer]]) introduced the [[Microprofessor I]], a simple and inexpensive training system for the Z80 microprocessor. Currently, it is still manufactured and sold by Flite Electronics International Limited in [[Southampton, England]].\n\nIn 1984 Toshiba introduced the Toshiba MSX HX-10 in Japan and Australia. \n\nIn 1985, [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the [[Hotbit]] and [[Gradiente]] introduced the [[Gradiente Expert|Expert]], which became the dominant 8-bit home computers in [[Brazil]] until the late 1980s.\n\n===Portable and handheld computers===\nUse of the Z80 in lighter, battery-operated devices became more widespread with the availability of CMOS versions of the processor.

The [[Sharp PC-1500]], a [[BASIC]]-programmable [[pocket computer]] was released in 1981, followed by the improved [[Sharp PC-1600]] in 1986 and the [[Sharp PC-E220]] in 1991. Later models of the [[Sharp Wizard]] series of personal organizers also were Z80 based. [[Laptop]]s which could run the CP/M operating system just like the desktop machines followed with [[Epson PX-8 Geneva]] in 1984, and in 1985 the [[Epson PX-4]] and [[Bondwell-2]]. While the laptop market in subsequent years moved to more powerful [[Intel 8086]] processors and the MS-DOS operating system, light-weight Z80-based systems with a longer battery life were still being introduced, such as the [[Cambridge Z88]] in 1988 and the [[Amstrad NC100]] in 1992. The Z80-derived [[Zilog Z180|Z8S180]] also found its way into an early [[pen computing|pen-operated]] [[personal digital assistant]], the [[PenPad#PDA600|Amstrad PenPad PDA600]] in 1993.

The [[Sega Genesis]] contains a Z80, with its own 8 KB of RAM, which runs in parallel with the MC68000 main CPU, has direct access to the system's sound chips and I/O (controller) ports, and has a switched data path to the main memory bus of the 68000 (providing access to the 64 KB main RAM, the software cartridge, and the whole video chip); in addition to providing backward compatibility with Master System games, the Z80 is often used to control and play back audio in Genesis software.{{efn-lr|This common, but merely optional and not limiting, usage leads to the frequent but incorrect description of the Z80 in the Genesis as a \"sound processor\".}}\n\nZ80 CPUs were also used in the trailblazing and popular [[Comparison of Texas Instruments graphing calculators|TI-8x series of graphing calculators]] from [[Texas Instruments]], beginning in 1990 with the [[TI-81]], which features a Z80 clocked at 2&nbsp;MHz.  Most higher-line calculators in the series, starting with the [[TI-82]] and [[TI-85]], clock their Z80 CPUs at 6&nbsp;MHz or higher. (A few models with TI-8x names use other CPUs, such as the M68000, but the vast majority are Z80-based. On those, it is possible to run assembled or compiled user programs in the form of Z80 machine-language code.) The [[TI-84 Plus series]], introduced in 2004, is still in production as of 2023. The [[TI-84 Plus series#TI-84 Plus CE and TI-84 Plus CE-T|TI-84 Plus CE series]], introduced in 2015, uses the Z80-derived [[Zilog eZ80]] processor and is also still in production as of 2023.\n\nIn the late 1980s, a series of [[Soviet]] landline phones called \"AON\" featured the Z80; these phones expanded the feature set of the landline with [[caller ID]], different [[ringtone]]s based on the caller, [[speed dial]] and so forth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://habr.com/en/post/486010/|title=Making a demo for an old phone — AONDEMO|website=habr.com|date=29 January 2020 }}</ref> In the second half of nineties manufacturers of these phones switched to 8051 compatible MCUs to reduce power consumption and prevent compact wall power adapters from overheating.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Zilog eZ80]]\n* [[S-100 bus]]\n* [[SymbOS]]\n* [[Z88DK]]\n* [[Micro-Professor MPF-I]], Z80 training system\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Scanlon_1988\">{{cite book |title=8086/8088/80286 assembly language |author-last=Scanlon |author-first=Leo J. |date=1988 |publisher=[[Brady Books]] |isbn=978-0-13-246919-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/8086808880286ass0000scan/page/12 12] |url=https://archive.org/details/8086808880286ass0000scan/page/12 |quote=[...] The [[8086]] is software-compatible with the [[8080]] at the assembly-language level.

(later to be better known as [[Sinclair Research]]). It is notable for being one of the first computers available in the [[United Kingdom]] for less than a hundred [[Pound Sterling|pounds]]. It was available in [[Electronic kit|kit form]] for £79.95, where purchasers had to assemble and solder it together, and as a ready-built version at £99.95.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=April 1981|title=Advertisement for Sinclair ZX81|url=https://archive.org/details/PracticalComputing1981April04|magazine=Practical Computing|volume=4|issue=4|pages=72–73}}</ref><ref name=\"byte198101\" />\n\nThe ZX80 was advertised as the first personal computer for under £100 and received praise for its value and documentation. However, it faced criticism for screen blanking during program execution, small RAM size, and the keyboard design. It was very popular straight away, and for some time there was a waiting list of several months for either version of the machine.\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe ZX80 was named after the Z80 processor with the 'X' meaning \"the mystery ingredient\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12703674 |title=ZX81: Small black box of computing desire|access-date=11 March 2011 | first=Stephen | last=Tomkins | work=BBC News|date=11 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Hardware ==\n\nInternally, the machine was designed by [[Jim Westwood]] around a [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] [[central processing unit]] with a [[clock speed]] of 3.25&nbsp;MHz, and was equipped with 1&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] of [[static RAM]] and 4&nbsp;KB of [[read-only memory]] (ROM). It had no sound output.{{fact|date=June 2022}}\n\nThe ZX80 was designed around readily available [[transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] chips; the only proprietary technology was the [[firmware]].{{fact|date=June 2022}}\n\nThe machine was mounted in a small white plastic case, with a one-piece blue [[membrane keyboard]] on the front. There were problems with durability, reliability and overheating (despite appearances, the black stripes visible on the top rear of the case are merely cosmetic, and are not ventilation slots).{{or|date=June 2022}}\n\nDisplay was over an [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[RF connector|connection]] to a household [[television]], and simple offline program storage was possible using a [[cassette deck|cassette recorder]]. The video display generator of the ZX80 used minimal hardware plus a combination of software to generate a video signal. This was an idea that was popularised by [[Don Lancaster]] in his 1978 book [[TV Typewriter#TV Typewriter Cookbook|''The TV Cheap Video Cookbook'']] and his \"[[TV Typewriter]]\".<ref>{{ cite book | chapter-url = http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zx80/zx80_sst.htm | chapter = A New Means To An Old End | title = Sinclair and the 'Sunrise' Technology | last = Adamson | first = Ian | author2 = Richard Kennedy | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | year = 1986 }}</ref> As a result of this approach the ZX80 could only generate a picture when it was idle, i.e. waiting for a key to be pressed. When running a BASIC program, or even when pressing a key for any input, the display would, therefore, blank out momentarily while the processor was busy. This made moving graphics difficult since the program had to introduce a pause for input to display the next change in graphical output.{{r|mccallum198101}}\n\nVideo output was black-and-white, character-based.{{r|mccallum198101}} However, the [[ZX80 character set]] included some simple block-based graphics glyphs, allowing basic graphics to be accomplished, with some effort. One advantage to using monochrome video is that different colour broadcast standards (e.g. [[PAL]], [[SECAM]]) simply weren't an issue when the system was sold outside the UK.{{fact|date=June 2022}}\n\n== Firmware ==\n\nThe 4 KB ROM contained the [[Sinclair BASIC#4K BASIC|Sinclair BASIC]] [[programming language]], editor, and [[operating system]]. BASIC commands were not entered by typing them out but were instead selected somewhat similarly to a programmable graphing calculator - each key had a few different functions selected by both context and modes as well as with the shift key.{{r|mccallum198101}}\n\n== Expansion ==\n[[File:Sinclair ZX80 with 8K upgrade keyboard at Powerhouse Sydney (filtered retouched).jpg|thumb|Upgraded ZX80 showing the ZX81-style replacement keyboard overlay for use with the 8K ROM]]\n\nOther than the built-in cassette and video ports, the only provided means of expansion was a slot opening at the rear of the case, which exposed an expansion bus [[edge connector]] on the motherboard. The same slot bus was continued on the ZX81, and later the [[ZX Spectrum]], which encouraged a small [[cottage industry]] of expansion devices, including memory packs, [[printer (computing)|printers]] and even [[floppy drive]]s. The original Sinclair ZX80 RAM Pack held either 1, 2 or 3&nbsp;KB of [[Static_random-access_memory|static RAM]]<ref name='fjkraan'>{{cite web |title=1 to 3K byte memory expansion RAM PACK for the Sinclair ZX80 |url=http://fjkraan.home.xs4all.nl/comp/zx80/rampack.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130222225950/http://fjkraan.home.xs4all.nl/comp/zx80/rampack.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 February 2013 |website=F J Kraan |access-date=8 December 2019 }}</ref>  and a later model held 16&nbsp;KB of [[Dynamic_random-access_memory|dynamic RAM]] (DRAM).<ref>{{cite web |title=Ultra Rare Vintage Sinclair ZX80 16K Byte Ram Pack (Mint) |url=https://www.ebay.co.uk/i/293012513981?chn=ps&norover=1&mkevt=1&mkrid=710-134428-41853-0&mkcid=2&itemid=293012513981&targetid=595627780033&device=c&mktype=pla&googleloc=1007408&poi=&campaignid=6619152134&mkgroupid=84510981728&rlsatarget=pla-595627780033&abcId=1140496&merchantid=9752904&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIt_WWg-u05gIVRrTtCh1bRg9fEAQYASABEgJl3vD_BwE |website=Ebay |access-date=14 December 2019}}{{dead link|date=September 2021}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the ZX81's release, a ZX81 8&nbsp;KB [[read-only memory|ROM]] was available to upgrade the ZX80 at a cost of around 20% of a real ZX81. It came with a thin keyboard overlay and a ZX81 manual. By simply taking off the top cover of the ZX80 and prying the old ROM from its socket and carefully inserting the new ROM and adding the keyboard overlay, the ZX80 would now function almost identically to the proper ZX81 – except for SLOW mode, due to the differences in hardware between the two models. The process was easily reversed to return the ZX80 to its original configuration.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Advertisement for ZX Printer |magazine=Your Computer |date=October 1981 |volume=1 |issue=3|pages=42–43 |url=https://archive.org/details/your-computer-magazine-1981-10/page/n41 |access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nOne common modification by hobbyist users was to attach a full-size keyboard, optionally moving the motherboard into a larger case. This had the dual advantages of making the machine easier to type on, while increasing ventilation to the motherboard.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=DK'Tronics advertisement for full sized keyboard |magazine=Your Computer |date=May 1982 |page=5 |volume=2 |issue=5 |url=https://archive.org/details/your-computer-magazine-1982-05/page/n5 |access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Versions ==\n\nThe UK version of the machine was the standard, and only changes that were absolutely necessary to sell units in other markets were made. In fact, the only real change made in most markets involved the video output frequency (the ZX80 used an external power transformer, so differences in AC line frequency and outlet were not an issue to the machine itself).  One outcome of this is that the machine had some keyboard keys and characters that were distinctly British:  {{keypress|NEWLINE}} was used instead of {{keypress|ENTER}}, {{keypress|RUBOUT}} instead of {{keypress|BACKSPACE}} or {{keypress|DELETE}}, and the character set and keyboard included the [[Pound sterling|Pound]] [[Pound sign|symbol]].\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe ZX80 was widely advertised as the first personal computer for under £100 GBP<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rk.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zx80/zx80.htm |title=ZX80 |website=Planet Sinclair }}</ref> (US$200.<ref name=\"byte198101\">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-01/1981_01_BYTE_06-01_Hand-held_Computers#page/n119/mode/2up | title=The first personal computer for under $200. | magazine=BYTE | volume=6 | issue=6 | date=January 1981 | access-date=18 October 2013 | type=Advertisement  | page=119}}</ref>{{r|mccallum198101}}) ''[[Kilobaud Microcomputing]]'' liked the design of the preassembled version, and said that the screen flickering during input or output was annoying but was useful as an indicator of the computer functioning correctly.

It praised the real-time, interactive BASIC syntax checking, and reported that the computer performed better on [[benchmark (computing)|benchmarks]] than some competitors, including the [[TRS-80 Model I]]. The screen blanking during program execution, the small RAM size and inadequate built-in Sinclair BASIC, and the keyboard received criticism, and the review recommended against buying the kit version of the computer given the difficulty of assembly and because purchasers did not save money. ''BYTE'' concluded that \"the ZX80 might be summarized as a high-performance, very low-cost, portable personal computer system ... the ZX80 is a good starting point\".<ref name=\"mccallum198101\">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-01/1981_01_BYTE_06-01_Hand-held_Computers#page/n95/mode/2up | title=The Sinclair Research ZX80 | magazine=BYTE | volume=6 | issue=6 | date=January 1981 | access-date=18 October 2013 | last=McCallum |first=John C | pages=94–102}}</ref>\n\nSales of the ZX80 reached about 50,000, which contributed significantly to the UK leading the world in home computer ownership through the 1980s.

Adding 0 to any number leaves that number unchanged. In mathematical terminology, 0 is the [[additive identity]] of the [[integer]]s, [[rational numbers]], [[real number]]s, and [[complex numbers]], as well as other [[algebraic structures]]. Multiplying any number by 0 has the result 0, and consequently, [[division by zero]] has [[Undefined (mathematics)|no meaning in arithmetic]].\n\nIn [[decimal]] notation, 0 plays a crucial role: it indicates that the [[power of ten]] corresponding to the place containing a 0 does not contribute to the total. For example, \"[[205 (number)|205]]\" in decimal means two hundreds, no tens, and five ones. The same principle applies in [[place-value notation]] that uses a base other than ten, such as [[binary number|binary]] and [[hexadecimal]]. The modern use of 0 in this manner derives from Indian mathematics that was transmitted to Europe via [[Mathematics in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic mathematicians]] and popularized by [[Fibonacci]]. It was independently used by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].\n\nCommon [[names for the number 0 in English]] are ''zero'', ''nought'', ''naught'' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɔː|t}}), ''nil''. In contexts where at least one adjacent digit distinguishes it from the [[O|letter O]], the number is sometimes pronounced as ''oh'' or ''o'' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ}}). Informal or [[slang]] terms for 0 include ''zilch'' and ''zip''. Historically, ''ought'', ''aught'' ({{IPAc-en|ɔː|t}}), and ''cipher'' have also been used.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Names for the number 0|Names for the number 0 in English}}\n\nThe word ''zero'' came into the English language via French {{lang|fr|zéro}} from the [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|zero}}, a contraction of the Venetian {{lang|vec|zevero}} form of Italian {{lang|it|zefiro}} via ''ṣafira'' or ''ṣifr''.<ref>See:\n* Douglas Harper (2011), [https://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=zero&searchmode=none Zero] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703014638/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=zero&searchmode=none |date=3 July 2017 }}, Etymology Dictionary, Quote=\"figure which stands for naught in the Arabic notation,\" also \"the absence of all quantity considered as quantity\", c. 1600, from French zéro or directly from Italian zero, from Medieval Latin zephirum, from Arabic sifr \"cipher\", translation of Sanskrit sunya-m \"empty place, desert, naught\";\n* {{Cite book |last=Menninger |first=Karl |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFJHzSIj2u0C |title=Number words and number symbols: a cultural history of numbers |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-486-27096-8 |pages=399–404 |access-date=5 January 2016 |archive-date=25 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425194842/https://books.google.com/books?id=BFJHzSIj2u0C |url-status=live }};\n* {{Cite web |date=December 2011 |title=zero, n. |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/232803?rskey=zGcSoq&result=1&isAdvanced=false |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65yd7ur9u?url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/232803?rskey=zGcSoq&result=1&isAdvanced=false |archive-date=7 March 2012 |access-date=4 March 2012 |website=OED Online |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |quote=\"French zéro (1515 in Hatzfeld & Darmesteter) or its source Italian zero, for *zefiro, < Arabic çifr\" }}</ref> In pre-Islamic time the word {{transliteration|ar|ṣifr}} (Arabic {{lang|ar|صفر}}) had the meaning \"empty\".<ref name=smithsonian/> {{transliteration|ar|Sifr}} evolved to mean zero when it was used to translate {{transliteration|sa|śūnya}} ({{lang-sa|शून्य}}) from India.<ref name=\"smithsonian\">See:\n* Smithsonian Institution, {{Google books|0_UyAQAAMAAJ|Oriental Elements of Culture in the Occident|page=518}}, Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution; Harvard University Archives, Quote=\"Sifr occurs in the meaning of \"empty\" even in the pre-Islamic time. ...

Sometimes, the word \"nought\" or \"naught\" is used.\n\nIt is often called \"oh\" in the context of reading out a string of digits, such as [[telephone number]]s, [[street address]]es, [[credit card number]]s, [[military time]], or years (e.g. the [[area code]] 201 would be pronounced \"two oh one\"; a year such as 1907 is often pronounced \"nineteen oh seven\"). The presence of other digits, indicating that the string contains only numbers, avoids confusion with the letter O. For this reason, systems that include strings with both letters and numbers (e.g. [[Canadian postal code]]s) may exclude the use of the letter O.\n\nSlang words for zero include \"zip\", \"zilch\", \"nada\", and \"scratch\".<ref name=\"thesaurus\">[http://thesaurus.com/browse/aught#visualthesaurus 'Aught' synonyms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823071642/http://thesaurus.com/browse/aught#visualthesaurus |date=23 August 2014 }}, Thesaurus.com – Retrieved April 2013.</ref>\n\n\"Nil\" is used for many sports in [[British English]].

For this reason, the numerals came to be known in Europe as \"Arabic numerals\". The Italian mathematician [[Fibonacci]] or Leonardo of Pisa was instrumental in bringing the system into European mathematics in 1202, stating:\n\n<blockquote>After my father's appointment by his homeland as state official in the customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed in the study of calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the [[Hinduism|Hindus]] (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things.

Zero is a number which quantifies a count or an amount of [[Empty set|null]] size. In most [[History of mathematics|cultures]], 0 was identified before the idea of negative things (i.e., quantities less than zero) was accepted.\n\nAs a value or a ''number'', zero is not the same as the ''digit'' zero, used in [[numeral system]]s with [[positional notation]]. Successive positions of digits have higher weights, so the digit zero is used inside a numeral to skip a position and give appropriate weights to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a positional number system (e.g., the number 02).

The [[determinant]] on non-invertible [[Matrix (mathematics)|square matrices]] is a zero map.\n* Several branches of mathematics have [[zero element]]s, which generalize either the property {{nowrap|0 + ''x'' {{=}} ''x''}}, or the property {{nowrap|0 · ''x'' {{=}} 0,}} or both.\n\n==Physics==\nThe value zero plays a special role for many physical quantities. For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished from all other levels, whereas for others it is more or less arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] (typically measured in [[kelvin]]s), [[absolute zero|zero]] is the lowest possible value. ([[Negative temperature]]s can be defined for some physical systems, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder.) This is in contrast to for example temperatures on the Celsius scale, where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the [[Melting point|freezing point]] of water.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Andrew |last1=Rex |first2=C.

In [[physics]], the [[zero-point energy]] is the lowest possible energy that a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[physical system]] may possess and is the energy of the [[Stationary state|ground state]] of the system.\n\n==Chemistry==\nZero has been proposed as the [[atomic number]] of the theoretical element [[tetraneutron]]. It has been shown that a cluster of four [[neutron]]s may be stable enough to be considered an [[atom]] in its own right. This would create an [[chemical element|element]] with no [[proton]]s and no charge on its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]].\n\nAs early as 1926, Andreas von Antropoff coined the term [[neutronium]] for a conjectured form of [[matter]] made up of neutrons with no protons, which he placed as the chemical element of atomic number zero at the head of his new version of the [[periodic table]]. It was subsequently placed as a noble gas in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for classifying the chemical elements.\n\n==Computer science==\nThe most common practice throughout human history has been to start counting at one, and this is the practice in early classic [[computer programming]] languages such as [[Fortran]] and [[COBOL]]. However, in the late 1950s [[LISP]] introduced [[zero-based numbering]] for arrays while [[Algol 58]] introduced completely flexible basing for array subscripts (allowing any positive, negative, or zero integer as base for array subscripts), and most subsequent programming languages adopted one or other of these positions. For example, the elements of an [[Array data type|array]] are numbered starting from 0 in [[C (computer language)|C]], so that for an array of ''n'' items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to {{nowrap|''n''−1}}.\n\nThere can be confusion between 0- and 1-based indexing; for example, Java's [[JDBC]] indexes parameters from 1 although [[Java (programming language)|Java]] itself uses 0-based indexing.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ResultSet (Java Platform SE 8 ) |url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html |access-date=2022-05-09 |website=docs.oracle.com |archive-date=9 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220509185749/https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn databases, it is possible for a field not to have a value.

However, in some computer hardware [[signed number representations]], zero has two distinct representations, a positive one grouped with the positive numbers and a negative one grouped with the negatives; this kind of dual representation is known as [[signed zero]], with the latter form sometimes called negative zero. These representations include the [[signed magnitude]] and [[ones' complement]] binary integer representations (but not the [[two's complement]] binary form used in most modern computers), and most [[floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] number representations (such as [[IEEE floating point|IEEE 754]] and [[IBM hexadecimal floating-point|IBM S/390]] floating-point formats).\n\nIn binary, 0 represents the value for \"off\", which means no electricity flow.{{sfn|Chris Woodford|2006|p=9}}\n\nZero is the value of false in many programming languages.\n\nThe [[Unix epoch]] (the date and time associated with a zero timestamp) begins the midnight before the first of January 1970.<ref>Paul DuBois.\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=lFsaBAAAQBAJ \"MySQL Cookbook: Solutions for Database Developers and Administrators\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224134429/https://books.google.com/books?id=lFsaBAAAQBAJ |date=24 February 2017 }}\n2014.\np. 204.</ref><ref>Arnold Robbins; Nelson Beebe.\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=J9WbAgAAQBAJ \"Classic Shell Scripting\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224134147/https://books.google.com/books?id=J9WbAgAAQBAJ |date=24 February 2017 }}.\n2005.\np. 274</ref><ref>Iztok Fajfar.\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=eHq9CgAAQBAJ \"Start Programming Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224134155/https://books.google.com/books?id=eHq9CgAAQBAJ |date=24 February 2017 }}.\n2015.\np. 160.</ref>\n\nThe [[Classic Mac OS]] [[epoch (computing)|epoch]] and [[Palm OS]] epoch (the date and time associated with a zero timestamp) begins the midnight before the first of January 1904.<ref>Darren R.

Despite his large-scale [[Great Society]] programs, Johnson was increasingly disliked by the [[New Left]] at home and abroad. For some, May 1968 meant the end of traditional collective action and the beginning of a new era to be dominated mainly by the so-called [[new social movements]].<ref>Staricco, Juan Ignacio (2012) https://www.scribd.com/doc/112409042/The-French-May-and-the-Roots-of-Postmodern-Politics {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306160322/https://www.scribd.com/doc/112409042/The-French-May-and-the-Roots-of-Postmodern-Politics |date=6 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Cuban Revolution]] led by [[Fidel Castro]], the United States attempted to depose the new leader by training Cuban exiles and [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|invading]] the island of [[Cuba]]. This led to Cuba to ally itself to the Soviet Union, a hostile enemy to the United States, resulting in an [[Cuban Missile Crisis|international crisis]] when Cuba hosted Soviet ballistic missiles similar to Turkey hosting American missiles, which brought the [[List of nuclear close calls|possibility]] of causing [[World War III|World War 3]]. However, after negotiations between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R, both agreed to withdraw their weapons averting potential [[nuclear warfare]].\n\nAfter U.S. President [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]], direct tensions between the superpower countries of the United States and the Soviet Union developed into a contest with [[List of conflicts related to the Cold War|proxy wars]], insurgency funding, puppet governments and other overall influence mainly in [[United States involvement in regime change in Latin America|Latin America]], Africa, and [[Cold War in Asia|Asia]]. This \"[[Cold War]]\" dominated the world's geopolitics during the decade. Africa was in a period of radical political change as 32 countries [[Decolonisation of Africa|gained independence]] from their [[List of former European colonies|European colonial rulers]]. The heavy-handed American role in the [[Vietnam War]] lead to an [[anti-Vietnam War movement]] with outraged student protestors around the globe culminating in the [[protests of 1968]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[History of the People's Republic of China (1949–1976)|China]] saw the end of [[Mao Zedong|Mao's]] [[Great Leap Forward]] in 1962 that led to many Chinese to die from [[Great Chinese Famine|the deadliest famine in human history]] and the start of the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976. Its stated goal was to preserve [[Ideology of the Chinese Communist Party|Chinese communism]] by [[Purge|purging]] remnants of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Chinese culture|traditional]] elements from [[Culture of the People's Republic of China|Chinese society]], leading to the arrests of a many Chinese politicians, the killings of millions of civilians and ethnic minorities, and the destruction of many historical and cultural buildings, artifacts and materials all of which would last until the [[Death and state funeral of Mao Zedong|death of Mao Zedong]].\n\nBy the end of the [[1950s]], post-war reconstructed Europe began an economic boom. World War II had closed up social classes with remnants of the old feudal gentry disappearing. A developing upper-working-class (a newly redefined middle-class) in Western Europe could afford a radio, television, refrigerator and motor vehicles. The [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were improving quickly after rebuilding from WWII. Real GDP growth averaged 6% a year during the second half of the decade; overall, the worldwide economy prospered in the 1960s with expansion of the middle class and the increase of new domestic technology.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the world population increased from 3.0 to 3.7&nbsp;billion people.

Mao alleged that \"liberal bourgeois\" elements were permeating the party and society at large and that they wanted to restore [[capitalism]]. Mao insisted that these elements be removed through post-revolutionary [[class struggle]] by mobilizing the thoughts and actions of China's youth, who formed [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] groups around the country. The movement subsequently spread into the military, urban workers, and the party leadership itself. Although Mao himself officially declared the Cultural Revolution to have ended in 1969, the power struggles and political instability between 1969 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976 are now also widely regarded as part of the Revolution.\n*The [[Naxalite]] movement in India began in 1967 with an [[Naxalbari uprising|armed uprising]] of tribals against local landlords in the village of [[Naxalbari]], West Bengal, led by certain leaders of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]. The movement was influenced by [[Maoism|Mao Zedong's ideology]] and spread to many tribal districts in Eastern India, gaining strong support among the radical urban youth. After counter-insurgency operations by the police, military and paramilitary forces, the movement fragmented but is still active in many districts.\n* [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland began with the rise of the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]] in the mid-1960s, the conflict continued into the later 1990s.\n* The [[Six point movement|Six-Point movement]] in Bangladesh (at the time East Pakistan).

This incident was one of the first recorded [[transgender]] riots in United States history, preceding the more famous 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City by three years.\n* The [[Stonewall riots]] occurred in June 1969 in New York City. The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the [[Stonewall Inn]], in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of New York City. They are frequently cited as the first instance in American history when people in the homosexual community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and they have become the defining event that marked the start of the [[gay rights movement]] in the United States and around the world.\n* In 1967, the [[National Farmers Organization]] withheld milk supplies for 15 days as part of an effort to induce a quota system to stabilize prices.\n* [[May 1968 events in France|The May 1968 student and worker uprisings in France]].\n* Mass socialist or Communist movement in most European countries (particularly France and Italy), with which the student-based new left was involved.

De Gaulle went off to visit French troops in Germany to check on their loyalty. Major concessions were won for trade union rights, higher minimum wages and better working conditions.\n* University students protested in the hundreds of thousands against the Vietnam War in London, Paris, Berlin and Rome.\n* In Eastern Europe students also drew inspiration from the protests in the West.

Not until [[Richard Nixon]] took office in 1969 was there another opportunity.\n** Following Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's expulsion in 1964, Sino-Soviet relations devolved into [[Sino-Soviet split|open hostility]]. The Chinese were deeply disturbed by the Soviet suppression of the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968, as the latter now claimed the right to intervene in any country it saw as deviating from the correct path of socialism. Finally, in March 1969, armed clashes took place along the [[China–Russia border|Sino-Soviet border]] in the former Manchuria. This drove the Chinese to restore relations with the US, as Mao Zedong decided that the Soviet Union was a much greater threat against them.\n\n=====India=====\n* In India a literary and cultural movement started in Calcutta, Patna, and other cities by a group of writers and painters who called themselves \"Hungryalists\", or members of the [[Hungry generation]]. The band of writers wanted to change virtually everything and were arrested with several cases filed against them on various charges. They ultimately won these cases.<ref>{{cite book|author=Krishna Dutta|title=Calcutta: A Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59wfjyIIJAkC&pg=PA220|year=2008|publisher=Interlink Books|page=220|isbn=978-1-56656-721-3|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-date=27 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627142825/http://books.google.com/books?id=59wfjyIIJAkC&pg=PA220|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=====Indonesia=====\n* The [[Transition to the New Order]] (1965–1968)\n** In the early hours of 1 October 1965, [[30 September Movement|a group of army officers]] launched an abortive coup d'état in [[Jakarta]], assassinated six senior [[Indonesian Army]] generals and a junior army officer. They also seized [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]] and later in the morning, proclaimed the establishment of the \"Council of Revolution\" through a radio broadcast, with [[Untung Syamsuri|Lieutenant Colonel Untung Syamsuri]] as its leader. \n** On the same day, [[Suharto|Major General Suharto]] successfully persuaded the soldiers on Merdeka Square to join forces with the Indonesian [[Army Strategic Reserve Command]] divisions and launched a counterattack on the movement, ending the coup attempt. Three days later, the bodies of seven army officers were found buried in an old well in [[Lubang Buaya]] and the bodies were recovered. \n** In the aftermath of the coup d'état attempt, the people blamed the attempt on the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]], prompt a [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965-66|mass purge]] against leftists and communist sympathizers across the country. Around 500,000-1,000,000 casualties were massacred. The killings were mostly done by the locals with the help of the Army. \n** Soon, mass demonstrations and protests from [[KAMI (Indonesia)|Indonesian Students' Action Front]] against [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|President Sukarno's government]] occurred. [[Sukarno|President Sukarno]] was notorious for his friendly approach towards the leftists, particularly the Communist Party of Indonesia.\n** In the climax of the protests, President Sukarno signed [[Supersemar]] on 11 March 1966, effectively transferred authority to Major General Suharto to restore order and ensure security in the country. On 12 March 1967, President Sukarno was stripped of his political power by the [[People's Consultative Assembly|Provisional People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPRS) and Major General Suharto became [[Acting presidency of Suharto|acting president]]. Later, he became president [[First inauguration of Suharto|formally]] on 27 March 1968. Sukarno lived under house arrest until his death in June 1970.\n\n=====Japan and South Korea=====\n* The [[Japanese economic miracle]] (1960s–1990s)\n** Japan's remarkable economic growth between the post-[[World War II]] era and the end of the [[Cold War]]. During the economic boom, Japan rapidly became the world's [[Economic history of Japan|second-largest economy]] at the time (after the United States).\n** In 1960, Japan was wracked by the massive [[Anpo protests]] against the revision of the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|U.S.-Japan Security Treaty]], resulting in the resignation of Prime Minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]]; Kishi's successor [[Hayato Ikeda]] began implementing economic policies, known as the [[Income Doubling Plan]] removed most of Japan's anti-monopoly laws and promised to double the size of Japan's economy within 10 years. [[Eisaku Satō]] became Prime Minister of Japan four years later, succeeding Ikeda due to health issues.\n** The [[1964 Summer Olympics]] were held in Japan, the first time the country hosted them and the first time that the [[Olympic Games]] were held in Asia. The start of operations for the world's first bullet train, the [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen]]) between [[Tokyo Station]] and [[Shin-Ōsaka Station]], it is the oldest high-speed rail system in the world.\n* The [[Second Republic of Korea|Second]] and [[Third Republic of Korea|Third Republics of Korea]] (1960–1972)\n** The [[April Revolution]] were a mass protests in [[South Korea]] against President [[Syngman Rhee]] and the [[First Republic of South Korea|First Republic]] from 11 to 26 April 1960 which led to Rhee's resignation. The Second Republic was established as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary government]] under President [[Yun Bo-seon]] and Prime Minister [[Chang Myon]]. The Second Republic ended the First Republic, formed a liberal democracy, and formulated the first [[Five-Year Plans of South Korea|Five-Year Plans]] to develop the formerly neglected economy.\n** The [[May 16 coup]] and the establishment of the [[Supreme Council for National Reconstruction|SCNR]], led by Major General [[Park Chung Hee]] on 16 May 1961, put an effective end to the Second Republic. Park was one of a group of military leaders who had been pushing for the de-politicization of the military.\n** The [[Miracle on the Han River]] began with the [[Five-Year Plans of South Korea]] was an economic development projects implemented by President Park Chung Hee, South Korea received US$800&nbsp;million from Japan under property claims, and was mostly dependent on [[Aid|foreign aid]], largely from the U.S. in exchange for South Korea's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].\n** South Korea's first diplomatic relations with Japan were established under the Third Republic, and [[Japan–South Korea relations|South Korea-Japan relations]] were normalized in the [[Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea|Treaty on Basic Relations]] signed on 22 July 1965, and in an agreement ratified on 14 August 1965. Japan agreed to provide a large amount of compensation, grants, and loans to South Korea, and the two countries began economic and political cooperation.\n\n====Africa====\n* On 1 September 1969, the Libyan monarchy was overthrown, and a radical, revolutionary, government headed by Col. Muammar al-Gadaffi took power.\n* On 1 October 1960, Nigeria gained its independence from Great Britain.\n\n====South America====\n* In 1964, a [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|successful coup]] against the democratically elected government of Brazilian president João Goulart, initiated a [[military dictatorship]] that caused over 20 years of oppression.\n* The [[Argentina|Argentine]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara|Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara]] travelled to Africa and then [[Bolivia]] in his campaigning to spread worldwide revolution. He was captured and executed in 1967 by the Bolivian army, and afterwards became an iconic figure for the left wing around the world.\n* [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] took power by a coup in Peru in 1968.\n\n==Economics==\n{{Globalize|article|USA|date=July 2018}}\nThe decade began with a recession from 1960 to 1961, at that time unemployment was considered high at around 7%. In his campaign, John F. Kennedy promised to \"get America moving again.\" His goal was economic growth of 4–6% per year and unemployment below 4%. To do this, he instituted a 7% tax credit for businesses that invest in new plants and equipment. By the end of the decade, median family income had risen from $8,540 in 1963 to $10,770 by 1969.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elcoushistory.tripod.com/economics1960.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606123915/http://elcoushistory.tripod.com/economics1960.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 June 2007|title=U.S. History – 1960s}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the first half of the decade had low inflation, by 1966 Kennedy's tax credit had reduced unemployment to 3.7% and inflation remained below 2%. With the economy booming Johnson began his \"Great Society\" which vastly expanded social programs. By the end of the decade under Nixon, the combined inflation and unemployment rate known as the [[misery index (economics)]] had exploded to nearly 10% with inflation at 6.2% and unemployment at 3.5% and by 1975 the misery index was almost 20%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inflationdata.com/articles/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-1960-1969/|title=Inflation and CPI Consumer Price Index 1960–1969|website=InflationData.com|access-date=9 October 2020|archive-date=9 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009192240/https://inflationdata.com/articles/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-1960-1969/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Assassinations and attempts==\n[[File:Patrice Lumumba in 1960.jpg|thumb|120px|upright|right|[[Patrice Lumumba]]]]\n[[File:John F.

It caused localized tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 meters (82&nbsp;ft). The main tsunami raced across the Pacific Ocean and devastated [[Hilo, Hawaii]].\n* [[1963 Skopje earthquake]] was a 6.1 moment magnitude earthquake which occurred in Skopje, SR Macedonia (present-day Republic of Macedonia) on 26 July 1963, which killed over 1,070 people, injured between 3,000 and 4,000 and left more than 200,000 people homeless. About 80% of the city was destroyed.\n* 1963 – [[Vajont Dam#Landslide and wave|Vajont dam disaster]] – The Vajont dam flood in Italy was caused by a mountain sliding in the dam and causing a flood wave that killed approximately 2,000 people in the towns in its path.\n* 1964 – The [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]], the most powerful earthquake recorded in the U.S. and North America, struck [[Alaska]] and killed 143 people.\n* 1965 – [[Hurricane Betsy]] caused severe damage to the U.S. Gulf Coast, especially in the state of [[Louisiana]].\n* 1969 – The [[Cuyahoga River]] caught fire in Ohio. Fires had erupted on the river many times, including 22 June 1969, when a river fire captured the attention of Time magazine, which described the Cuyahoga as the river that \"oozes rather than flows\" and in which a person \"does not drown but decays.\" This helped spur legislative action on water pollution control resulting in the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, and the creation of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.\n* 1969 – [[Hurricane Camille]] hit the U.S. Gulf Coast at Category 5 Status. It peaked and made landfall with 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h) winds and caused $1.42&nbsp;billion (1969 USD) in damages.\n\n'''Non-natural:'''\n* On 16 December 1960, a [[United Airlines]] DC-8 and a [[Trans World Airlines]] Lockheed Constellation [[1960 New York mid-air collision|collided over New York City]] and crashed, killing 134 people.\n* On 15 February 1961, [[Sabena Flight 548]] crashed on its way to Brussels, Belgium, killing all 72 passengers on board and 1 person on the ground. Among those killed were all 18 members of the US figure skating team, on their way to the World Championships. \n* On 16 March 1962, [[Flying Tiger Line Flight 739]], a Lockheed Super Constellation, inexplicably disappeared over the Western Pacific, leaving all 107 on board presumed dead. Since the wreckage of the aircraft is lost to this day, the cause of the crash remains a mystery.\n* On 3 June 1962, [[Air France Flight 007]], a Boeing 707, crashed on takeoff from Paris. 130 people were killed in the crash while 2 survived.\n* On 20 May 1965, [[PIA Flight 705]] crashed on approach to [[Cairo]], Egypt. 121 died while 6 survived.\n* On 4 February 1966, [[All Nippon Airways Flight 60]], a Boeing 727, plunged into [[Tokyo Bay]] for reasons unknown. All 133 people on board died.\n* On 5 March 1966, [[BOAC Flight 911]] broke up in mid-air and crashed on the slopes of [[Mount Fuji]]. All 124 aboard died.\n* On 8 December 1966, the car ferry [[SS Heraklion|SS ''Heraklion'']] sank in the [[Aegean Sea]] during a storm, killing 217 people.\n* On 16 March 1969, a DC-9 operating [[Viasa Flight 742]] crashed in the Venezuelan city of [[Maracaibo]]. A total of 155 people died in the crash.\n\n==Social and political movements==\n===Counterculture and social revolution===\n{{See also|Counterculture of the 1960s | Timeline of 1960s counterculture}}\nIn the second half of the decade, young people began to revolt against the conservative norms of the old time, as well as remove themselves from mainstream liberalism, in particular the high level of materialism which was so common during the era. This created a \"counterculture\" that sparked a social revolution throughout much of the Western world. It began in the United States as a reaction against the conservatism and social conformity of the 1950s, and the U.S. government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. The youth involved in the popular social aspects of the movement became known as [[hippies]]. These groups created a movement toward liberation in society, including the [[sexual revolution]], questioning authority and government, and demanding more freedoms and rights for women and minorities. The [[Underground Press]], a widespread, eclectic collection of newspapers served as a unifying medium for the counterculture. The movement was also marked by the first widespread, socially accepted drug use (including [[LSD]] and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]) and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] music.\n\n===Anti-war movement===\n{{main|Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War}}\n[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|left|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police guarding [[the Pentagon]] during the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]]'s 21 October 1967 [[March on the Pentagon]]]]\nThe war in Vietnam would eventually lead to a commitment of over half a million American troops, resulting in over 58,500 American deaths and producing a large-scale antiwar movement in the United States. As late as the end of 1965, few Americans protested the American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war dragged on and the body count continued to climb, civil unrest escalated. Students became a powerful and disruptive force and university campuses sparked a national debate over the war. As the movement's ideals spread beyond college campuses, doubts about the war also began to appear within the administration itself. A mass movement began rising in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], ending in the massive [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] protests in 1969, as well as the movement of resistance to [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] (\"the Draft\") for the war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe [[antiwar movement]] was initially based on the older 1950s [[Peace movement]], heavily influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], but by the mid-1960s it outgrew this and became a broad-based mass movement centered in universities and churches: one kind of protest was called a \"[[sit-in]]\". Other terms heard in the United States included \"[[the Draft]]\", \"[[draft dodger]]\", \"[[conscientious objector]]\", and \"[[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam vet]]\". Voter age-limits were challenged by the phrase: \"If you're old enough to die for your country, you're old enough to vote.\"\n\n===Civil rights movement===\n{{Main|Civil rights movement}}\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march posing in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln... - NARA - 542063 (cropped).jpg|thumb|240px|Leaders of the [[civil rights movement]]'s 28 August 1963, [[March on Washington]] in front of the [[Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln Memorial)|statue of Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n\nBeginning in the mid-1950s and continuing into the late 1960s, [[African Americans]] in the United States organized a movement to end legalized [[racial discrimination]] and obtain [[Suffrage|voting rights]]. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955 and 1968, particularly in the South. The emergence of the [[Black Power movement]], which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the civil rights movement to include racial dignity, [[Economy of the United States|economic]] and [[politics of the United States|political]] [[self-sufficiency]], and [[anti-imperialism]].\n\nThe movement was characterized by major campaigns of [[civil resistance]]. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of [[civil disobedience]] and [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] protest produced crisis situations between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included boycotts such as the successful [[Montgomery bus boycott]] (1955–1956) in Alabama; \"[[sit-in]]s\" such as the influential [[Greensboro sit-ins]] (1960) in North Carolina; [[Demonstration (people)|marches]], such as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] (1965) in Alabama; and other nonviolent activities.\n\nNoted legislative achievements during this phase of the civil rights movement were passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name=\"cra64\">{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 – CRA – Title VII – Equal Employment Opportunities – 42 US Code Chapter 21|access-date=22 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021141154/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> that banned discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, or national origin\" in employment practices and public accommodations; the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], that restored and protected voting rights; the [[Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965]], that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]], that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.\n\n===Hispanic and Chicano movement===\nAnother large ethnic minority group, the [[Mexican-Americans]], are among other [[Hispanics]] in the U.S. who fought to end racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparity. The largest Mexican-American populations were in the Southwestern United States, such as California with over 1 million ''[[Chicanos]]'' in Los Angeles alone, and [[Texas]] where [[Jim Crow]] laws included Mexican-Americans as \"non-white\" in some instances to be legally segregated.\n\nSocially, the [[Chicano Movement]] addressed what it perceived to be negative [[ethnic stereotype]]s of Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. It did so through the creation of works of literary and visual art that validated Mexican-American ethnicity and culture. Chicanos fought to end social stigmas such as the usage of the Spanish language and advocated official [[bilingualism]] in federal and state governments.\n\nThe Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination. One of those organizations, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], was formed in 1929 and remains active today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lulac.org/about/history/ |title=LULAC History{{snd}}All for One and One for All |website=[[League of United Latin American Citizens]] |access-date=22 March 2023}}</ref>\n\nThe movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the [[American G.I. Forum]], which was formed by returning Mexican American veterans, joined in the efforts by other civil rights organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |title=americangiforum.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706223234/http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |archive-date=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMexican-American civil-rights activists achieved several major legal victories including the 1947 ''[[Mendez v.

The main concentration of the population was in New York City.\n\nIn the 1960s and the following 1970s, Hispanic-American culture was on the rebound like ethnic music, foods, culture and identity both became popular and assimilated into the American mainstream. Spanish-language television networks, radio stations and newspapers increased in presence across the country, especially in U.S.–Mexican border towns and East Coast cities like New York City, and the growth of the [[Cuban American]] community in Miami, Florida.\n\nThe multitude of discrimination at this time represented an inhuman side to a society that in the 1960s was upheld as a world and industry leader. The issues of civil rights and warfare became major points of reflection of virtue and democracy, what once was viewed as traditional and inconsequential was now becoming the significance in the turning point of a culture. A document known as the Port Huron Statement exemplifies these two conditions perfectly in its first hand depiction, \"while these and other problems either directly oppressed us or rankled our consciences and became our own subjective concerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The declaration \"all men are created equal...\" rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North. The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.\" These intolerable issues became too visible to ignore therefore its repercussions were feared greatly, the realization that we as individuals take the responsibility for encounter and resolution in our lives issues was an emerging idealism of the 1960s.\n\n===Second-wave feminism===\n{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}\nA second wave of feminism in the United States and around the world gained momentum in the early 1960s. While the first wave of the early 20th century was centered on gaining suffrage and overturning ''de jure'' inequalities, the second wave was focused on changing cultural and social norms and ''de facto'' inequalities associated with women. At the time, a woman's place was generally seen as being in the home, and they were excluded from many jobs and professions. In the U.S., a [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] found discrimination against women in the workplace and every other aspect of life, a revelation which launched two decades of prominent women-centered legal reforms (i.e., the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Title IX]], etc.) which broke down the last remaining legal barriers to women's personal freedom and professional success.\n\nFeminists took to the streets, marching and protesting, authoring books and debating to change social and political views that limited women. In 1963, with [[Betty Friedan]]'s book, ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', the role of women in society, and in public and private life was questioned. By 1966, the movement was beginning to grow in size and power as women's group spread across the country and Friedan, along with other feminists, founded the [[National Organization for Women]]. In 1968, \"[[Women's Liberation]]\" became a household term as, for the first time, the new women's movement eclipsed the [[civil rights movement]] when [[New York Radical Women]], led by [[Robin Morgan]], [[Miss America protest|protested the annual Miss America pageant]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The movement continued throughout the next decades. [[Gloria Steinem]] was a key feminist.\n\n===Gay rights movement===\n{{Main|Gay liberation|LGBT social movements}}\nThe United States, in the middle of a social revolution, led the world in LGBT rights in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Inspired by the civil-rights movement and the women's movement, early gay-rights pioneers had begun, by the 1960s, to build a movement. These groups were rather conservative in their practices, emphasizing that ''gay men and women are no different from those who are straight'' and deserve full equality. This philosophy would be dominant again after AIDS, but by the very end of the 1960s, the movement's goals would change and become more radical, demanding a right to be different, and encouraging [[gay pride]].\n\nThe symbolic birth of the [[gay rights movement]] would not come until the decade had almost come to a close. Gays were not allowed by law to congregate. Gay establishments such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] in New York City were routinely raided by the police to arrest gay people. On a night in late June 1969, LGBT people resisted, for the first time, a police raid, and rebelled openly in the streets. This uprising called the [[Stonewall riots]] began a new period of the LGBT rights movement that in the next decade would cause dramatic change both inside the LGBT community and in the mainstream American culture.\n\n===New Left===\nThe rapid rise of a \"[[New Left]]\" applied the class perspective of [[Marxism]] to postwar America but had little organizational connection with older Marxist organizations such as the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], and even went as far as to reject organized labor as the basis of a unified left-wing movement. Sympathetic to the ideology of [[C. Wright Mills]], the New Left differed from the traditional left in its resistance to dogma and its emphasis on personal as well as societal change. [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) became the organizational focus of the New Left and was the prime mover behind the opposition to the War in Vietnam. The 1960s left also consisted of ephemeral campus-based [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], [[Maoism|Maoist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups, some of which by the end of the 1960s had turned to [[Militant (word)|militancy]].\n\n===Crime===\nThe 1960s was also associated with a large increase in crime and urban unrest of all types. Between 1960 and 1969 reported incidence of violent crime per 100,000 people in the United States nearly doubled and have yet to return to the levels of the early 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134627/http://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf|url-status=dead|title=U.S. Census Bureau Data |archive-date=24 September 2015}}</ref> Large riots broke out in many cities like Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey]], [[Oakland, California]] and Washington, D.C. By the end of the decade, politicians like [[George Wallace]] and [[Richard Nixon]] campaigned on restoring law and order to a nation troubled with the new unrest.\n\n==Science and technology==\n===Science===\n====Space exploration====\n[[File:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|thumb|250px|On 21 December 1968, the [[Apollo 8]] crew took a picture, for the first time in history, of the entire Earth]]\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Apollo 11]] mission landed the first humans on the Moon in July 1969.]]\nThe [[Space Race]] between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the 1960s. The Soviets sent the first man, [[Yuri Gagarin]], into [[outer space]] during the [[Vostok 1]] mission on 12 April 1961, and scored a host of other successes, but by the middle of the decade the U.S. was taking the lead. In May 1961, President Kennedy set the goal for the United States of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\nIn June 1963, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] became the first woman in space during the [[Vostok 6]] mission. In 1965, Soviets launched the first probe to hit another planet of the [[Solar System]] ([[Venus]]), [[Venera 3]], and the first probe to make a soft landing on and transmit from the surface of the Moon, [[Luna 9]]. In March 1966, the Soviet Union launched [[Luna 10]], which became the first [[space probe]] to enter orbit around the Moon, and in September 1968, [[Zond 5]] flew the first terrestrial beings, including two tortoises, to circumnavigate the Moon.\n\nThe deaths of astronauts [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] in the [[Apollo 1]] fire on 27 January 1967, put a temporary hold on the U.S. space program, but afterward progress was steady, with the [[Apollo 8]] crew ([[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]], [[William Anders]]) being the first crewed mission to orbit another celestial body (the Moon) during Christmas of 1968.\n\nOn 20 July 1969, the [[Moon landing|first humans landed on the Moon]]. The [[Apollo 11]] mission, launched on 16 July 1969, carried mission Commander [[Neil Armstrong]], Command Module Pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]], and Aldrin and Armstrong flew the Lunar Module ''[[Lunar Module Eagle|Eagle]]'' to the lunar surface. Apollo 11 fulfilled President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of reaching the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which he had expressed during a speech given before a joint session of Congress on 25 May 1961: \"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"\n\nThe Soviet program lost its sense of direction with the death of chief designer [[Sergey Korolyov]] in 1966. Political pressure, conflicts between different design bureaus, and engineering problems caused by an inadequate budget would doom the Soviet attempt to land men on the Moon. Shortly after the American Apollo 1 disaster, tragedy struck the Soviet program when cosmonaut [[Vladimir Komarov]] was killed when the parachutes on his [[Soyuz 1]] flight failed.\n\nA succession of uncrewed American and Soviet probes traveled to the Moon, [[Venus]], and [[Mars]] during the 1960s, and commercial satellites also came into use.\n\n====Other scientific developments====\n[[File:Antibabypille.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[birth control pill]] was introduced in 1960.]]\n* 1960 – The female birth-control contraceptive, [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], was released in the United States after [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval.\n* 1963 – The measles vaccine was released after being approved by the FDA\n* 1964 – The discovery and confirmation of the [[Cosmic microwave background]] in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. \n* 1965 – [[AstroTurf]] introduced.\n* 1967 – First [[heart transplantation]] operation by Professor [[Christiaan Barnard]] in South Africa.\n* 1967 – Discovery of the first known [[pulsar]] (a rapidly spinning [[neutron star]]).\n* During the late 1960s, the [[Green Revolution]] achieved a major leap in agricultural production, mitigating a potential famine situation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter B.R.

The horsepower race reached its climax in the late 1960s, with [[muscle cars]] sold by most makes. The compact [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatest successes. The \"[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]\" American automakers enjoyed their highest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of [[Studebaker]] in 1966 left [[American Motors Corporation]] as the last significant independent. The decade would see the car market split into different size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included [[Compact car|compact]] and [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] cars in addition to [[Full-size car|full-sized]] ones.\n\nThe popular modern hatchback, with front-wheel-drive and a two-box configuration, was born in 1965 with the introduction of the [[Renault 16]], many of this car's design principles live on in its modern counterparts: a large rear opening incorporating the rear window, foldable rear seats to extend boot space. The [[Mini]], released in 1959, had first popularised the front wheel drive two-box configuration, but technically was not a hatchback as it had a fold-down bootlid.\n\nJapanese cars also began to gain acceptance in the Western market, and popular economy models such as the [[Toyota Corolla]], [[Datsun 510]], and the first popular Japanese sports car, the [[Datsun 240Z]], were released in the mid- to late-1960s.\n\n====Electronics and communications====\n[[File:60s tech.jpg|thumb|Examples of 1960s technology, including two rotary-dial telephones and a Kodak camera.]]\n* 1960 – The first working laser was demonstrated in May by [[Theodore Maiman]] at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]].\n* 1960 – [[Tony Hoare]] announces the [[Quicksort]] [[algorithm]], the most common sorter on computers.\n* 1961 – [[Unimate]], the first [[industrial robot]], was introduced.\n* 1962 – First transatlantic satellite broadcast via the [[Telstar]] satellite.\n* 1962 – The first computer video game, ''[[Spacewar!]]'', was invented.\n* 1962 – Red [[LED]]s were developed.\n* 1963 – The first [[Geosynchronous satellite|geosynchronous communications satellite]], ''[[Syncom 2]]'', is launched.\n* 1963 – First transpacific satellite broadcast via the [[Relay 1]] satellite.\n* 1963 – [[Touch-Tone]] telephones introduced.\n* 1963 – [[Sketchpad]] was the first touch interactive [[computer graphics]] program.\n* 1963 – The [[Nottingham]] Electronic Valve company produced the first home [[Videocassette recorder|video recorder]] called the \"Telcan\".\n* 1964 – [[8-track tape]] audio format was developed.\n* 1964 – The [[Compact Cassette]] was introduced.\n* 1964 – The first successful [[Minicomputer]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s 12-bit [[PDP-8]], was marketed.\n* 1964 – The [[programming language]] [[BASIC]] was created.\n* 1964 – The world's first [[supercomputer]], the [[CDC 6600]], was introduced.\n* 1964 – [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] released [[Integrated Circuit|IC]]s with [[Dual in-line package|dual in-line packaging]].\n* 1967 – [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] broadcast color television systems started publicly transmitting in Europe.\n* 1967 – The first [[Automatic Teller Machine]] was opened in [[Barclays Bank]], London.\n* 1968 – [[Ralph Baer]] developed his [[Brown Box]] (a working prototype of the Magnavox Odyssey).\n* 1968 – The [[The Mother of All Demos|first public demonstration]] of the [[computer mouse]], the [[paper paradigm]] [[Graphical user interface]], [[video conference|video conferencing]], [[teleconference|teleconferencing]], email, and [[hypertext]].\n* 1969 – [[ARPANET]], the research-oriented prototype of the Internet, was introduced.\n* 1969 – [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] invented at AT&T [[Bell Labs]], used as the electronic imager in still and video cameras.\n\n==Additional notable worldwide events==\n\n* The [[Manson murders]] occurred between 8–10 August 1969, when actress [[Sharon Tate]], coffee heiress [[Abigail Folger]], and several others were brutally murdered in the Tate residence by [[Charles Manson]]'s \"family.\" [[Rosemary LaBianca]] and [[Leno LaBianca]] were also murdered by the Manson family the following night.\n* Canada celebrated its 100th anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1967 by hosting [[Expo 67]], the World's Fair, in [[Montreal]], Quebec.

[[Psychedelic drugs]], especially [[LSD]], were widely used medicinally, spiritually and recreationally throughout the late 1960s, and were popularized by [[Timothy Leary]] with his slogan \"[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]\". [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] also played a part in the role of \"turning heads on\". [[Psychedelia|Psychedelic]] influenced the music, artwork and films of the decade, and a number of prominent musicians died of drug overdoses (see [[27 Club]]). There was a growing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy, and many attempts were made to found communes, which varied from supporting free love to religious puritanism.\n\n===Music===\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| image1            = The Beatles i Hötorgscity 1963.jpg\n| width1            = 179\n| alt1              = Beatles\n| caption1          = The arrival of [[the Beatles]] in the U.S. during 1964, and particularly their appearance on television's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', marked the beginning of the [[British Invasion]] in the history of music, in which a large number of rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom gained enormous popularity in the U.S.\n| image2            = Joan Baez Bob Dylan crop.jpg\n| width2            = 165\n| alt2              = Dylan\n| caption2          = [[Bob Dylan]] was the face of the [[American folk music revival]] of the 1960s.

As the 1960s began, the major rock 'n' roll stars of the '50s such as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]] had dropped off the charts and popular music in the U.S. came to be dominated by girl groups, [[surf music]], novelty pop songs, clean-cut teen idols, and [[Motown]] music. Another important change in music during the early 1960s was the [[American folk music revival]] which introduced [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[The Kingston Trio]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Odetta]], [[Phil Ochs]], and many other singer-songwriters to the public.\n\nGirl groups and female singers, such as [[the Shirelles]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Little Eva]], [[the Dixie Cups]], [[the Ronettes]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]] and [[the Supremes]] dominated the charts in the early 1960s. This style consisted typically of light pop themes about teenage romance and lifestyles, backed by vocal harmonies and a strong rhythm. Most girl groups were African-American, but white girl groups and singers, such as [[Lesley Gore]], [[The Angels (American group)|the Angels]], and [[the Shangri-Las]] also emerged during this period.\n\nAround the same time, record producer [[Phil Spector]] began producing girl groups and created a new kind of pop music production that came to be known as the [[Wall of Sound]]. This style emphasized higher budgets and more elaborate arrangements, and more melodramatic musical themes in place of a simple, light-hearted pop sound. Spector's innovations became integral to the growing sophistication of popular music from 1965 onward.\n\nAlso during the early 1960s, [[surf rock]] emerged, a rock subgenre that was centered in Southern California and based on beach and surfing themes, in addition to the usual songs about teenage romance and innocent fun. [[The Beach Boys]] quickly became the premier surf rock band and almost completely and single-handedly overshadowed the many lesser-known artists in the subgenre. Surf rock reached its peak in 1963–1965 before gradually being overtaken by bands influenced by the [[British Invasion]] and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe [[car song]] also emerged as a rock subgenre in the early 1960s, which focused on teenagers' fascination with [[car culture]]. The Beach Boys also dominated this subgenre, along with the duo [[Jan and Dean]]. Such notable songs include \"[[Little Deuce Coupe (song)|Little Deuce Coupe]]\", \"[[409 (song)|409]]\", and \"[[Shut Down (The Beach Boys song)|Shut Down]]\", all by the Beach Boys; [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Little Old Lady from Pasadena]]\" and \"[[Drag City (song)|Drag City]]\", [[Ronny and the Daytonas]]' \"[[Little GTO]]\", and many others. Like girl groups and surf rock, car songs also became overshadowed by the British Invasion and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe early 1960s also saw the golden age of another rock subgenre, the [[teen tragedy song]], which focused on lost teen romance caused by sudden death, mainly in [[Traffic collision|traffic accidents]]. Such songs included [[Mark Dinning]]'s \"[[Teen Angel (song)|Teen Angel]]\", [[Ray Peterson]]'s \"[[Tell Laura I Love Her]]\", [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Dead Man's Curve (song)|Dead Man's Curve]]\", [[the Shangri-Las]]' \"[[Leader of the Pack]]\", and perhaps the subgenre's most popular, \"[[Last Kiss]]\" by [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers]].\n\nIn the early 1960s, Britain became a hotbed of rock 'n' roll activity during this time. In late 1963, the Beatles embarked on their first US tour and cult singer [[Dusty Springfield]] released her first solo single. A few months later, rock 'n' roll founding father [[Chuck Berry]] emerged from a {{frac|2|1|2}}-year prison stint and resumed recording and touring. The stage was set for the spectacular revival of rock music.\n\nIn the UK, the Beatles played raucous rock 'n' roll – as well as doo wop, girl-group songs, show tunes – and wore leather jackets. Their manager [[Brian Epstein]] encouraged the group to wear suits. [[Beatlemania]] abruptly exploded after the group's appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1964. Late in 1965, the Beatles released the album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' which marked the beginning of their transition to a sophisticated power pop group with elaborate studio arrangements and production, and a year after that, they gave up touring entirely to focus only on albums. A host of imitators followed the Beatles in the so-called British Invasion, including groups like [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Who]] and [[the Kinks]] who would become legends in their own right.\n\nAs the counterculture movement developed, artists began making new kinds of music influenced by the use of psychedelic drugs. Guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] emerged onto the scene in 1967 with a radically new approach to electric guitar that replaced Chuck Berry, previously seen as the gold standard of rock guitar. Rock artists began to take on serious themes and social commentary/protest instead of simplistic pop themes.\n\nA major development in popular music during the mid-1960s was the movement away from singles and towards albums. Previously, popular music was based around the 45 single (or even earlier, the 78 single) and albums such as they existed were little more than a hit single or two backed with filler tracks, instrumentals, and covers. The development of the AOR (album-oriented rock) format was complicated and involved several concurrent events such as Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, the introduction by Bob Dylan of \"serious\" lyrics to rock music, and the Beatles' new studio-based approach. In any case, after 1965 the vinyl LP had definitively taken over as the primary format for all popular music styles.\n\nBlues also continued to develop strongly during the '60s, but after 1965, it increasingly shifted to the young white rock audience and away from its traditional black audience, which moved on to other styles such as soul and funk.\n\n[[Jazz]] music and [[adult pop|pop standards]] during the first half of the 1960s was largely a continuation of 1950s styles, retaining its core audience of young, urban, college-educated whites. By 1967, the death of several important jazz figures such as [[John Coltrane]] and [[Nat King Cole]] precipitated a decline in the genre. The takeover of rock in the late 1960s largely spelled the end of jazz and standards as mainstream forms of music, after they had dominated much of the first half of the 20th century.\n\n[[Country music]] gained popularity on the [[West coast of the United States|West Coast]], due in large part to the [[Bakersfield sound]], led by [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. Female country artists were also becoming more mainstream (in a genre dominated by men in previous decades), with such acts as [[Patsy Cline]], [[Loretta Lynn]], and [[Tammy Wynette]].\n\n====Significant events in music in the 1960s====\n* [[Elvis Presley]] returned to civilian life in the U.S. after two years away in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].

Movies began to break social taboos such as [[sex in film|sex]] and [[violence in art|violence]] causing both controversy and fascination. They turned increasingly dramatic, unbalanced, and hectic as the cultural revolution was starting. This was the beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] era that dominated the next decade in theatres and revolutionized the film industry. Films of this time also focused on the changes happening in the world. [[Dennis Hopper]]'s ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) focused on the [[drug culture]] of the time. Movies also became more sexually explicit, such as [[Roger Vadim]]'s'' [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968) as the [[counterculture]] progressed.\n\nIn Europe, [[Art Cinema]] gains wider distribution and sees movements like [[French New Wave|la Nouvelle Vague]] (The French New Wave) featuring French filmmakers such as [[Roger Vadim]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Alain Resnais]], and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]; [[Cinéma vérité]] documentary movement in Canada, France and the United States; [[Swedish cinema|Swedish filmmaker]] [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[cinema of Chile|Chilean filmmaker]] [[Alexandro Jodorowsky]] and [[Polish cinema|Polish filmmakers]] [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Wojciech Jerzy Has]] produced original and offbeat masterpieces and the high-point of [[Italian cinema|Italian filmmaking]] with [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Federico Fellini]] making some of their most known films during this period. Notable films from this period include: ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', ''[[8 1/2|{{frac|8|1|2}}]]''; ''[[La Notte]]''; ''[[L'Eclisse]]'', ''[[The Red Desert]]''; ''[[Blowup]]''; ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]''; ''[[Accattone]]''; ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]''; ''[[Theorem (film)|Theorem]]''; ''[[Winter Light]]''; ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]''; ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''; ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]''; ''[[The Passion of Anna|A Passion]]''; ''[[Au Hasard Balthazar]]''; ''[[Mouchette]]''; ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]''; ''[[Chronique d'un été]]''; ''[[Titicut Follies]]''; ''[[High School (1968 film)|High School]]''; ''[[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]]''; ''[[La jetée]]''; ''[[Warrendale (film)|Warrendale]];'' ''[[Knife in the Water]]''; ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]''; ''[[The Saragossa Manuscript (film)|The Saragossa Manuscript]]''; ''[[El Topo]]''; ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''; and the [[cinema verite]] ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.\n\n[[file:The Magnificent Seven cast publicity photo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yul Brynner]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[Horst Buchholz]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Robert Vaughn]], [[Brad Dexter]], and [[James Coburn]] in [[John Sturges]]'s ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', 1960]]\n\nIn Japan, a film version of the story of the [[forty-seven ronin]] entitled ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki]]'' directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] was released in 1962, the legendary story was also remade as a television series in Japan. Academy Award-winning [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), and ''[[Sanjuro]]'' (1962), which both starred [[Toshiro Mifune]] as a mysterious [[Samurai]] swordsman for hire. Like his previous films both had a profound influence around the world. The ''[[Spaghetti Western]]'' genre was a direct outgrowth of the Kurosawa films. The influence of these films is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) starring [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" trend which included Sergio Leone's ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', and ''[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]]'' both also starring Clint Eastwood, and arguably continued through his 1968 opus ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', starring [[Henry Fonda]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Claudia Cardinale]], and [[Jason Robards]]. ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' a 1960 American [[western film]] directed by [[John Sturges]] was a [[remake]] of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1954 film, ''[[Seven Samurai]]''. Another popular figure in this genre was [[John Wayne]], with films from the 60s such as ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962), ''[[El Dorado (1966 film)|El Dorado]]'' (1966), ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969) and others.\n\nThe 1960s were also about experimentation. With the explosion of lightweight and affordable cameras, the underground [[New American Cinema|avant-garde film]] movement thrived.

Major League Baseball sanctioned both the [[Houston Colt .45s]] and the [[New York Mets]] as new [[National League (baseball)|National League]] franchises in 1962.\n\nIn 1969, the [[American League]] expanded when the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]], were admitted to the league prompting the expansion of the post-season (in the form of the [[League Championship Series]]) for the first time since the creation of the World Series. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving and becoming the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in 1970. The National League also added two teams in 1969, the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[San Diego Padres]]. By 1969, the New York Mets won the [[World Series]] in only the 8th year of the team's existence.\n\n====Basketball====\nThe [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] tournaments during the 1960s were dominated by the [[Boston Celtics]], who won eight straight titles from 1959 to 1966 and added two more consecutive championships in 1968 and 1969, aided by such players as [[Bob Cousy]], [[Bill Russell (basketball)|Bill Russell]] and [[John Havlicek]]. Other notable NBA players included [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Jerry West]] and [[Oscar Robertson]].\n\nAt the [[NCAA]] level, the [[UCLA Bruins]] also proved dominant. Coached by [[John Wooden]], they were helped by [[Lew Alcindor]] and by [[Bill Walton]] to win championships and dominate the American college basketball landscape during the decade.\n\n====Disc sports (Frisbee)====\nAlternative sports, using the flying disc, began in the mid-sixties. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They would form what would become known as the [[counterculture]]. The forms of escape and resistance would manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[Frisbee]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Countercultural Sports in America: The History and Meaning of Ultimate Frisbee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qycPRAAACAAJ|author=Jordan Holtzman-Conston|publisher=Waltham, Mass|year=2010|isbn=978-3838311951|access-date=28 December 2017|archive-date=24 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724120036/https://books.google.com/books?id=qycPRAAACAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> Starting with promotional efforts from [[Wham-O]] and [[Irwin Toy]] (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using [[Frisbee]] show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events, disc sports such as [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]], [[double disc court]], [[Guts (flying disc game)|guts]], [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] became this sports first events.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/|work=WFDF Official Website|access-date=19 October 2013|archive-date=18 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018043512/http://wfdf.org/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation |url=http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |work=History of the Flying Disc |access-date=20 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019095944/http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |archive-date=19 October 2013 }}</ref> Two sports, the team sport of [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] are very popular worldwide and are now being played semiprofessionally.<ref>{{cite web|title=Professional Disc Golf Association|url=http://www.pdga.com/|work=PDGA Official Website|access-date=19 October 2013|archive-date=9 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210509023305/https://www.pdga.com/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=American Ultimate Disc League|url=http://theaudl.com/|work=AUDL Official Website|access-date=20 October 2013|archive-date=21 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021064303/http://theaudl.com/|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[World Flying Disc Federation]], [[Professional Disc Golf Association]] and the Freestyle Players Association are the official rules and sanctioning organizations for flying disc sports worldwide.

Many regions had periods of high-intensity conflict, notably [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[Latin America]], and [[Africa]].\n\nIn the Western world, [[social progressive]] values that began in the [[1960s]], such as increasing political awareness and [[Second-wave feminism|economic liberty of women]], continued to grow. In the United Kingdom, the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 election]] resulted in the victory of its [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader [[Margaret Thatcher]], the first female British Prime Minister. Industrialized countries [[1973–1975 recession|experienced an economic recession]] due to [[1973 oil crisis|an oil crisis]] caused by oil embargoes by the [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries]]. The crisis saw the first instance of [[stagflation]] which began a political and [[Economic history|economic trend]] of the replacement of [[Keynesian]] economic theory with [[neoliberal]] economic theory, with the first neoliberal government coming to power with the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]].\n\nThe 1970s was also an era of great technological and scientific advances; since the appearance of the first commercial microprocessor, the [[Intel 4004]] in 1971, the decade was characterised by a profound transformation of computing units – by then rudimentary, spacious machines – into the realm of portability and home accessibility.\n\nOn the other hand, there were also great advances in fields such as physics, which saw the consolidation of [[quantum field theory]] at the end of the decade, mainly thanks to the confirmation of the existence of quarks and the detection of the first gauge bosons in addition to the photon, the Z boson and the gluon, part of what was christened in 1975 as the [[Standard Model]].\n\nIn Asia, the People's Republic of China's international relations changed significantly following its recognition by the United Nations, the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the beginning of market liberalization by Mao's successors. Despite facing an oil crisis due to the OPEC embargo, the economy of Japan witnessed a large boom in this period, overtaking the economy of West Germany to become the second-largest in the world.<ref name=\"secondecon\">{{cite web |url=http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=903&catid=24&subcatid=155 |title=Economic History of Japan in the 1970a and 80s |first=Jeffrey |last=Hays |publisher=Facts and Details |access-date=2012-12-02 |date=August 2012 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519154037/http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=903&catid=24&subcatid=155 |archive-date=2012-05-19 }}</ref> The United States withdrew its military forces from the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, which led to the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].\n\nThe 1970s saw an initial increase in violence in the Middle East as Egypt and Syria declared war on Israel, but in the late 1970s, the situation in the Middle East was fundamentally altered when Egypt signed the [[Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty]]. Political tensions in Iran exploded with the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979, which overthrew the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] and established an [[Islamic republic]] under the leadership of [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]].\n\nAfrica saw further [[decolonization]] in the decade, with Angola and Mozambique gaining their independence in 1975 from the [[Portuguese Empire]] after the [[Carnation Revolution]] in Portugal. The continent was, however, plagued by endemic military coups, with the long-reigning [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] [[Haile Selassie]] being removed, civil wars and famine.\n\nThe economies of much of the [[developing world]] continued to make steady progress in the early 1970s because of the [[Green Revolution]]. However, their economic growth was slowed by the oil crisis, although it boomed afterwards.\n\nThe 1970s saw the world population increase from 3.7 to 4.4&nbsp;billion, with approximately 1.23&nbsp;billion births and 475 million deaths occurring during the decade.\n\n==Politics and wars==\n{{See also|List of sovereign states in the 1970s}}\n[[File:Cold War alliances mid-1975.png|thumb|750px|center|The world map of military alliances in 1970s: Western allies (blue), Non-aligned countries (green) and Soviet allies (red)]]\n===Wars===\n[[File:DakToVietnam1966.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Vietnam War]] (1955–1975)]]\n{{Main|List of wars 1945–1989#1970–1979}}\nThe most notable wars and/or other conflicts of the decade include:\n*The [[Cold War]] (1945–1991)\n** The [[Vietnam War]] came to a close in 1975 with the fall of Saigon and the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975.

The Israelis were taken by surprise and suffered heavy losses before they rallied. In the end, they managed to repel the Egyptians (and a simultaneous attack by Syria in the Golan Heights) and crossed the Suez Canal into Egypt proper. In 1978, Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel at [[Camp David]] in the United States, ending outstanding disputes between the two countries. Sadat's actions would lead to his [[Assassination of Anwar El Sadat|assassination in 1981]].\n*[[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] (1974)\n*[[Indonesian invasion of East Timor]] (1975)\n* [[The Emergency (India)|Indian emergency]] (1975–1977)\n* [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–1990) – A civil war in the Middle East which at times also involved the PLO and Israel during the early 1980s.\n* [[Western Sahara War]] (1975–1991) – A regional war pinning the rebel [[Polisario Front]] against Morocco and Mauritania.\n* [[Ugandan–Tanzanian War]] (1978–1979) – the war which was fought between Uganda and Tanzania was based on an [[Expansionism|expansionist]] agenda to annex territory from Tanzania. The war resulted in the overthrow of [[Idi Amin]]'s regime.\n* The [[Ogaden War]] (1977–1978) was another African conflict between Somalia and Ethiopia over control of the [[Ogaden]] region.\n* The [[Rhodesian Bush War]] (1964–1979)\n\n===International conflicts===\n[[File:1979 Iranian Revolution.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[1979 Iranian Revolution]]]]\nThe most notable International conflicts of the decade include:\n* Major conflict between capitalist and communist forces in multiple countries, while attempts are made by the Soviet Union and the United States to lessen the chance for conflict, such as both countries endorsing nuclear nonproliferation.\n* In June 1976, peaceful student protests in the [[Soweto]] township of South Africa by black students against the use of Afrikaans in schools led to the [[Soweto uprising]] which killed more than 176 people, overwhelmingly by South Africa's [[Security Police]].<ref name=\"Harrison 1987\">{{cite book|title=The White Tribe of AKHONA ZULU Africa|year=1987|first=David|last=Harrison}}</ref>\n* Rise of separatism in the province of [[Quebec]] in Canada. In 1970, radical [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] militants of the ''[[Front de libération du Québec]]'' (FLQ) kidnapped the Quebec labour minister [[Pierre Laporte]] and British Trade Commissioner [[James Cross]] during the [[October Crisis]], resulting in Laporte being killed, and the enactment of [[martial law]] in Canada under the [[War Measures Act]], resulting in a campaign by the Canadian government which arrests suspected FLQ supporters. The election of the ''[[Parti Québécois]]'' led by [[René Lévesque]] in the province of [[Quebec]] in Canada, brings the first political party committed to Quebec independence into power in Quebec. Lévesque's government pursues an agenda to secede Quebec from Canada by democratic means and strengthen Francophone Québécois culture in the late 1970s, such as the controversial [[Charter of the French Language]] more commonly known in Quebec and Canada as \"Bill 101\".\n* [[Martial law]] was declared in the Philippines on September 21, 1972, by [[President of the Philippines|dictator]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].\n* In Cambodia, the communist leader [[Pol Pot]] led a revolution against the American-backed government of [[Lon Nol]]. On April 17, 1975, Pot's forces captured [[Phnom Penh]], the capital, two years after America had halted the bombings of their positions. His communist government, the [[Khmer Rouge]], forced people out of the cities to clear jungles and establish a radical, Marxist agrarian society. Buddhist priests and monks, along with anyone who spoke foreign languages, had any sort of education, or even wore glasses were tortured or killed. As many as 3 million people may have died. Vietnam [[Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia|invaded the country]] at the start of 1979, overthrowing the Khmer Rouge and installing a [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|satellite government]]. This provoked a brief, but furious [[Sino-Vietnamese War|border war with China]] in February of that year.\n* The [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 transformed Iran from an autocratic pro-Western monarchy under Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] to a [[theocracy|theocratic]] [[Islamist]] government under the leadership of [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]. Distrust between the revolutionaries and Western powers led to the [[Iran hostage crisis]] on November 4, 1979, where 66 diplomats, mainly from the United States, were held captive for 444 days.\n* Growing internal tensions take place in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] beginning with the [[Croatian Spring]] movement in 1971 which demands greater decentralization of power to the constituent republics of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia's communist ruler [[Joseph Broz Tito]] subdues the Croatian Spring movement and arrests its leaders, but does initiate major constitutional reform resulting in the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution]] which decentralized powers to the republics, gave them the official right to separate from Yugoslavia, and weakened the influence of Serbia (Yugoslavia's largest and most populous constituent republic) in the federation by granting significant powers to the Serbian autonomous provinces of Kosovo and [[Vojvodina]]. In addition, the 1974 Constitution consolidated Tito's dictatorship by proclaiming him president-for-life. The 1974 Constitution would become resented by Serbs and began a gradual escalation of ethnic tensions.\n\n===Coups===\n[[File:Selassie restored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Haile Selassie]] was overthrown from power in Ethiopia, ending one of the longest-lasting monarchies in world history.]]\n{{Main|List of coups d'état and coup attempts#1970–1979}}\nThe most prominent [[coups d'état]] of the decade include:\n* 1970 – Coup in Syria, led by [[Hafez al-Assad]].\n* 1971 – [[1971 Ugandan coup d'état|Military coup]] in Uganda led by [[Idi Amin]].\n* 1973 – [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|Coup d'état in Chile on September 11th]], Salvador Allende was overthrown and killed in a military attack on the presidential palace.

It would ultimately lead to the decolonization of all its colonies, but leave power vacuums that led to civil war in newly independent Lusophone African nations.\n* 1975 – [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], [[President of Bangladesh]], and almost his entire family was [[assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|assassinated]] in the early hours of August 15, 1975, when a group of [[Bangladesh Army]] personnel went to his residence and killed him, during a coup d'état.\n* 1976 – [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] seizes control of Argentina in 1976 through a [[1976 Argentine coup d'état|coup]] sponsored by the Argentine military, establishing himself as a dictator of a [[National Reorganization Process|military junta]] government in the country.\n* 1977 – Military coup in Pakistan political leaders including Zulfikar Ali Bhutto arrested. Martial law declared\n* 1979 – an Attempted coup in Iran, backed by the United States, to overthrow the [[Interim Government of Iran (1979)|interim government]], which had come to power after the [[Iranian Revolution]]. [What coup?]\n* 1979 – Coup in El Salvador, President General Carlos Humberto Romero, was overthrown by junior ranked officers, who formed a Junta government, which lead to the beginning of a 12-year civil war.\n\n===Terrorist attacks===\n{{Main|List of terrorist incidents#1970s–2000s}}\nThe most notable terrorist attacks of the decade include:\n* The [[Munich massacre]] takes place at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, Germany, where Palestinians belonging to the terrorist group [[Black September (group)|Black September]] organization kidnapped and murdered eleven Israeli athletes.\n* Rise in the use of terrorism by militant organizations across the world. Groups in Europe like the [[Red Brigades]] and the [[Baader-Meinhof]] Gang were responsible for a spate of bombings, kidnappings, and murders. Violence continued in Northern Ireland and the Middle East. Radical American groups existed as well, such as the Weather Underground and the Symbionese Liberation Army, but they never achieved the size or strength of their European counterparts.\n*On September 6, 1970, the world witnessed the beginnings of modern rebellious fighting in what is today called as [[Dawson's Field hijackings|Skyjack Sunday]]. Palestinian terrorists hijacked four [[airliner]]s and took over 300 people on board as hostage. The hostages were later released, but the planes were blown up.\n\n===Prominent political events===\n'''Worldwide'''\n* [[1973 oil crisis]] and [[1979 energy crisis]]\n* The presence and rise of a significant number of women as heads of state and heads of government in a number of countries across the world, many being the first women to hold such positions, such as [[Soong Ching-ling]] continuing as the first Chairwoman of the People's Republic of China until 1972, [[Isabel Perón]] as the first woman President in Argentina in 1974 until being deposed in 1976, [[Elisabeth Domitien]] becomes the first woman Prime Minister of Central African Republic, [[Indira Gandhi]] continuing as Prime Minister of India until 1977, [[Lidia Gueiler Tejada]] becoming the interim President of Bolivia beginning from 1979 to 1980, [[Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo]] becoming the first woman Prime Minister of Portugal in 1979, and [[Margaret Thatcher]] becoming the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1979.\n\n'''Americas'''<br />\n[[File:Nixon-depart.png|thumb|right|Nixon displays the [[V sign|V-for-victory sign]] as he departs the White House after resigning]]\n* United States President [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as president on August 9, 1974, while [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|facing charges for impeachment]] for the [[Watergate scandal]].\n* [[Augusto Pinochet]] rose to power as ruler of Chile after [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|overthrowing]] the country's Socialist president [[Salvador Allende]] in 1973 with the assistance of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) of the United States. Pinochet would remain the dictator of Chile until 1990.\n* Argentine president [[Isabel Perón|Isabel Peron]] begins the [[Dirty War]], where the military and security forces hunt down left-wing political dissidents as part of [[Operation Condor]]. She is overthrown in a [[1976 Argentine coup d'état|military coup]] in 1976, and [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] comes to power and continues the Dirty War until the military junta relinquished power in 1983. \n* Suriname was granted independence from the Netherlands on November 25, 1975.\n* In Guyana, the Rev. [[Jim Jones]] led several hundred people from his People's Temple in California to create and maintain a Utopian Marxist commune in the jungle named [[Jonestown]]. Amid allegations of corruption, mental, sexual, and physical abuse by Jones on his followers, and denying them the right to leave Jonestown, a Congressional committee and journalists visited Guyana to investigate in November 1978. The visitors (and several of those trying to leave Jonestown with them) were attacked and shot by Jones' guards at the airport while trying to depart Guyana together. Congressman [[Leo Ryan]] was among those who were shot to death. The demented Jones then ordered everyone in the commune to commit suicide. The people drank or were forced to drink, cyanide-laced fruit punch (Flavor Aid). A total of over 900 dead were found (approximately 1/3 of which were children), including Jones, who had shot himself.  Multiple units of the United States military were organized, mobilized, and sent to Guyana to recover over 900 deceased Jonestown residents.  After rejections from the Guyanese Government for the United States to bury the Jonestown dead in Guyana, US military personnel were then tasked to prepare and transport the human remains from Guyana for burial in the USA.  The US General Accounting Office later detailed an approximate cost of $4.4&nbsp;million (in taxpayer dollars) for Jonestown's clean-up and recovery operation expenses. \n* The [[Somoza family|Somoza]] dictatorship in Nicaragua is [[Nicaraguan Revolution|ousted]] in 1979 by the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]], leading to the [[Contras|Contra War]] in the 1980s.  \n* Greenland was granted [[Devolution|self-government]] (or \"[[home rule]]\") within the Kingdom of Denmark on November 29, 1979.<ref>{{cite news|title=Greenland Takes a Step Towards Autonomy|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/independence-day-greenland-takes-a-step-towards-autonomy-a-592880.html|newspaper=Spiegel Online|access-date=10 January 2015|date=2008-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Greenland Profile – BBC|work=BBC News |date=29 May 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18249815|access-date=10 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''Europe'''<br />\n[[File:Carter Brezhnev sign SALT II.jpg|thumb|right|United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]] sign the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II treaty]], June 18, 1979, in [[Vienna]], Austria]]\n\n* [[Margaret Thatcher]] and the Conservative party rose to power in the United Kingdom in 1979, initiating a [[neoliberal]] economic policy of reducing government spending, weakening the power of trade unions, and promoting economic and trade liberalization.\n* [[Francisco Franco]] died after 39 years in power. [[Juan Carlos&nbsp;I]] was crowned king of Spain and called for the [[Spanish transition to democracy|reintroduction of democracy]]. The dictatorship in Spain ended. The first general elections were held in 1977 and [[Adolfo Suárez]] became [[Prime minister of Spain]] after his Centrist Democratic Union won. The Socialist and Communist parties were legalized. The current Spanish Constitution was signed in 1978.\n* In 1972, [[Erich Honecker]] was chosen to lead East Germany, a role he would fill for the whole of the 1970s and 1980s. The mid-1970s were a time of extreme recession for East Germany, and as a result of the country's higher debts, consumer goods became more and more scarce. If East Germans had enough money to procure a television set, a telephone, or a [[Trabant]] automobile, they were placed on waiting lists which caused them to wait as much as a decade for the item in question.\n* [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland continued, with an explosion of political violence erupting in the early 1970s. Notable attacks include the [[McGurk's Bar bombing|McGurk's Car bombing]], the [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] massacre, and the [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]]. \n* The Soviet Union under the leadership of [[Leonid Brezhnev]], having the largest armed forces and the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, pursued an agenda to lessen tensions with its rival superpower, the United States, for most of the seventies. That policy, known as [[détente]], abruptly ended with the [[Soviet-Afghan war|Soviet invasion in Afghanistan]] at the end of 1979. While known as a \"period of stagnation\" in Soviet historiography, the Seventies are largely considered as a sort of a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of the USSR in terms of stability and relative well-being. Nevertheless, hidden inflation continued to increase for the second straight decade, and production consistently fell short of demand in agriculture and consumer goods manufacturing. By the end of the 1970s, signs of social and economic stagnation were becoming very pronounced.\n* [[Enver Hoxha]]'s rule in Albania was characterized in the 1970s by growing isolation, first from a very public schism with the Soviet Union the decade before, and then by a [[Sino-Albanian Split|split]] in friendly relations with China in 1978. Albania normalized relations with [[Yugoslavia]] in 1971, and attempted trade agreements with other European nations, but was met with vocal disapproval by the United Kingdom and the United States.\n*In 1977 the [[Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II]] was the international celebration marking the 25th anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth II to the thrones of seven countries.\n* 1978 would become known as the \"Year of Three Popes\". In August, [[Paul&nbsp;VI]], who had ruled since 1963, died. His successor was Cardinal Albino Luciano, who took the name [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul]]. But only 33 days later, he was found dead, and the Catholic Church had to elect another pope. On October 16, Karol Wojtyła, a Polish cardinal, was elected, becoming [[Pope John Paul&nbsp;II]]. He was the first non-Italian pope since 1523.\n\n'''Asia'''<br />\n[[File:Camp David, Menachem Begin, Anwar Sadat, 1978.jpg|thumb|right|Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] and Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] shake hands, [[Camp David]], 1978]]\n[[File:Nixon and Zhou toast.jpg|thumb|right|Nixon and Zhou toast, 1972]]\n* On September 17, 1978, the [[Camp David Accords]] were signed between Israel and Egypt. The Accords led directly to the 1979 [[Egypt–Israel peace treaty]]. They also resulted in Sadat and Begin sharing the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize.\n* Major changes in the People's Republic of China. US president [[Richard Nixon]] [[1972 visit by Richard Nixon to China|visited the country in 1972]] following visits by [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1971, restoring relations between the two countries, although formal diplomatic ties were not established until 1979. In 1976, [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] both died, leading to the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the beginning of a new era. After the brief rule of Mao's chosen successor [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's paramount leader, and began to shift the country towards market economics and away from ideologically driven policies. In 1979, Deng Xiaoping [[State visit by Deng Xiaoping to the United States|visited the US]].\n* In 1971, the representatives of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], then-[[President of the Republic of China]] (Taiwan), were [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|expelled]] from the United Nations and replaced by the People's Republic of China. Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, and in 1978 his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] became president, beginning a shift towards democratization in Taiwan. \n* In Iraq, [[Saddam Hussein]] began to rise to power by helping to modernize the country. One major initiative was removing the Western monopoly on [[Petroleum|oil]], which later during the high prices of [[1973 oil crisis]] would help Hussein's ambitious plans. On July 16, 1979, he assumed the [[President of Iraq|presidency]] cementing his rise to power. His presidency led to the breaking off of a Syrian-Iraqi unification, which had been sought under his predecessor [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] and would lead to the [[Iran–Iraq War]] starting in the 1980s.\n* Japan's economic growth surpassed the rest of the world in the 1970s, unseating the United States as the world's foremost industrial power.\n* On April 17, 1975, the [[Khmer Rouge]], led by [[Pol Pot]], took over Cambodia's capital [[Phnom Penh]].\n**From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge carried out the [[Cambodian genocide]] that killed nearly two million.\n*On April 13, 1975, the Lebanese Civil War began.\n*In 1978, Zia ul Haq came to power\n*In 1979, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was hanged in jail\n\n'''Africa'''\n* [[Idi Amin]], President of Uganda from 1971 to 1979, after rising to power in a coup became infamous for his brutal dictatorship in Uganda. Amin's regime persecuted opposition to his rule and pursued a [[Racism|racist]] agenda of removing [[Asians]] from Uganda (particularly [[demographics of India|Indians]] who arrived in Uganda during British colonial rule). Amin initiated the [[Ugandan–Tanzanian War]] in 1978 in alliance with Libya based on an [[Expansionism|expansionist]] agenda to annex territory from Tanzania which resulted in Ugandan defeat and Amin's overthrow in 1979.\n* South African activist [[Steve Biko]] died in 1977.\n* [[Francisco Macías Nguema]] ruled Equatorial Guinea as a brutal dictator from 1969 until his overthrow and execution in 1979.\n* [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], who had ruled the Central African Republic since 1965, proclaimed himself Emperor Bokasa&nbsp;I and renamed his impoverished country the Central African Empire in 1977.

It is the most significant accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history.\n\n==Worldwide trends==\nSuperpower tensions had cooled by the 1970s, with the bellicose US–Soviet confrontations of the 1950s–60s giving way to the policy of \"détente\", which promoted the idea that the world's problems could be resolved at the negotiating table. Détente was partially a reaction against the policies of the previous 25 years, which had brought the world dangerously close to nuclear war on several occasions, and because the US was in a weakened position following the failure of the Vietnam War. As part of détente, the US also restored ties with the People's Republic of China, partially as a counterweight against Soviet expansionism.\n\nThe US–Soviet geopolitical rivalry nonetheless continued through the decade, although in a more indirect faction as the two superpowers jockeyed relentlessly for control of smaller countries. American and Soviet intelligence agencies gave funding, training, and material support to insurgent groups, governments, and armies across the globe, each seeking to gain a geopolitical advantage and install friendly governments. Coups, civil wars, and terrorism went on across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and also in Europe where a spate of Soviet-backed Marxist terrorist groups were active throughout the decade. Over half the world's population in the 1970s lived under a repressive dictatorship. In 1979, a new wrinkle appeared in the form of Islamic fundamentalism, as the Shia theocracy of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] overthrew the Shah of Iran and declared itself hostile to both Western democracy and godless communism.\n\nPeople were deeply influenced by the rapid pace of societal change and the aspiration for a more egalitarian society in cultures that were long colonized and have an even longer history of hierarchical [[social structure]].\n\nThe [[Green Revolution]] of the late 1960s brought about self-sufficiency in food in many developing economies. At the same time an increasing number of people began to seek urban prosperity over agrarian life. This consequently saw the duality of transition of diverse interaction across social [[communities]] amid increasing information blockade across social class.\n\nAnother common global ethos of the 1970s world included increasingly flexible and varied gender roles for women in industrialized societies. More women could enter the workforce. However, the gender role of men remained as that of a breadwinner. The period also saw the socioeconomic effect of an ever-increasing number of women entering the non-agrarian economic workforce. The [[Iranian revolution]] also affected global attitudes toward and among those of the Muslim faith toward the end of the 1970s.\n\nThe global experience of the cultural transition of the 1970s and an experience of a global [[zeitgeist]] revealed the interdependence of economies since World War&nbsp;II, in a world increasingly polarized between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\n==Assassinations and attempts==\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\n[[File:King Faisal of_Saudi Arabia in 1971 (cropped).jpg|thumb|120px|right|[[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]]]]\n[[File:Aldo Moro.jpg|thumb|120px|right|[[Aldo Moro]]]]\n[[File:Park Chung-hee.jpg|thumb|120px|right|[[Park Chung Hee]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n! style=\"width:120px;\" | Date\n!Name\n!Position\n!Country\n!

As a result, the 1970s adversely distinguished itself from the prosperous postwar period between 1945 and 1973. The oil shocks [[Arab Oil Embargo|of 1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] added to the existing ailments and conjured high inflation throughout much of the world for the rest of the decade. U.S. manufacturing industries began to decline as a result, with the United States running its last trade surplus ({{as of|2009|lc=y}}) in 1975. In contrast, Japan and West Germany experienced economic booms and started overtaking the U.S. as the world's leading manufacturers. In 1970, Japan overtook West Germany to become the world's second-largest economy.<ref name=\"secondecon\" /> Japan would rank as the world's second-largest economy until 1994 when the [[European Economic Area]] (18 countries under a single market) came into effect.\n\nIn the US, the average annual inflation rate from 1900 to 1970 was approximately 2.5%. From 1970 to 1979, however, the average rate was 7.06%, and topped out at 13.29% in December 1979.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inflationdata.com/articles/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-1970-1979/|title=Inflation and CPI Consumer Price Index 1970–1979|website=InflationData.com}}</ref> This period is also known for \"[[stagflation]]\", a phenomenon in which inflation and unemployment steadily increased. It led to double-digit interest rates that rose to unprecedented levels (above 12% per year). The prime rate hit 21.5 in December 1980, the highest in history.<ref name=\"'70s 292\"/> A rising cost of housing was reflected in the average price of a new home in the U.S. The average price of a new home in the U.S. was $23,450 in 1970 up to $68,700 by 1980. By the time of 1980, when U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] was running for [[1980 United States presidential election|re-election]] against [[Ronald Reagan]], the [[Misery index (economics)|misery index]] (the sum of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate) had reached an all-time high of 21.98%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inflationdata.com/articles/misery-index/|title=Misery Index|website=InflationData.com}}</ref> The economic problems of the 1970s would result in a sluggish cynicism replacing the optimistic attitudes of the 1950s and 1960s and a distrust of government and technology. Faith in government was at an all-time low in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, as exemplified by the low voter turnout in the 1976 United States presidential election.\nThere was also the [[1973–74 stock market crash]].\n\nGreat Britain also experienced considerable economic turmoil during the decade as outdated industries proved unable to compete with Japanese and German wares. Labor strikes happened with such frequency as to almost paralyze the country's infrastructure. Following the [[Winter of Discontent]], Margaret Thatcher was elected prime minister in 1979 with the purpose of implementing extreme economic reforms.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, Soviet-style command economies began showing signs of stagnation, in which successes were persistently dogged by setbacks. The oil shock increased East European, particularly Soviet, exports, but a growing inability to increase agricultural output caused growing concern to the governments of the [[COMECON]] block, and a growing dependence on food imported from democratic nations.\n[[File:Line at a gas station, June 15, 1979.jpg|thumb|right|Line at a gas station in Maryland, June 15, 1979.]]\nOn the other hand, export-driven economic development in Asia, especially by the [[Four Asian Tigers]] (Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan), resulted in rapid economic transformation and industrialization. Their abundance of [[cheap labor]], combined with educational and other policy reforms, set the foundation for development in the region during the 1970s and beyond.\n\n===Oil crisis===\nEconomically, the 1970s were marked by the [[1970s Energy Crisis|energy crisis]] which peaked in 1973 and 1979 (see [[1973 oil crisis]] and [[1979 oil crisis]]). After the first oil shock in 1973, gasoline was rationed in many countries. Europe particularly depended on the Middle East for oil; the United States was also affected even though it had its own oil reserves. Many European countries introduced car-free days and weekends. In the United States, customers with a license plate ending in an odd number were only allowed to buy gasoline on odd-numbered days, while even-numbered plate-holders could only purchase gasoline on even-numbered days. The realization that oil reserves were not endless and technological development was not [[sustainable development|sustainable]]{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} without potentially harming the environment ended the belief in limitless progress that had existed since the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} As a result, [[environmentalism|ecological awareness]] rose substantially, which had a major effect on the economy.\n\n==Science and technology==\n{{Main|1970s in science and technology}}\n\n===Science===\nThe 1970s witnessed an explosion in the understanding of solid-state physics, driven by the development of the [[integrated circuit]], and the [[laser]]. [[Stephen Hawking]] developed his theories of [[black holes]] and the boundary-condition of the universe at this period with his theory called [[Hawking radiation]]. The biological sciences greatly advanced, with molecular biology, bacteriology, virology, and genetics achieving their modern forms in this decade. Biodiversity became a cause of major concern as habitat destruction, and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] revolutionized evolutionary thought.\n\n====Space exploration====\nAs the 1960s ended, the United States had made two successful crewed [[lunar landing]]s. Many Americans lost interest afterward, feeling that since the country had accomplished President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, there was no need for further missions. There was also a growing sentiment that the billions of dollars spent on the [[space program]] should be put to other uses. The Moon landings continued through 1972, but the near loss of the [[Apollo&nbsp;13]] mission in April 1970 served to further anti-[[NASA]] feelings. Plans for missions up to [[Apollo 20]] were canceled, and the remaining Apollo and [[Saturn]] hardware was used for the [[Skylab]] space station program in 1973–1974, and for the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP), which was carried out in July 1975. Many of the ambitious projects NASA had planned for the 1970s were canceled amid heavy budget cutbacks, and instead it would devote most of the decade to the development of the [[Space Shuttle]]. ASTP was the last crewed American space flight for the next five years. The year 1979 witnessed the spectacular reentry of Skylab over Australia. NASA had planned for a Shuttle mission to the space station, but the shuttles were not ready to fly until 1981, too late to save it.\n\nMeanwhile, the Soviets, having failed in their attempt at crewed lunar landings, canceled the program in 1972. By then, however, they had already begun [[Salyut programme|Salyut]], the world's first [[space station]] program, which began in 1971. This would have problems of its own, especially the tragic loss of the [[Soyuz&nbsp;11]] crew in July 1971 and the near-loss of the [[Soyuz 18a]] crew during launch in April 1975. It eventually proved a success, with missions as long as six months being conducted by the end of the decade.\n\nIn terms of uncrewed missions, a variety of lunar and [[planetary probe]]s were launched by the US and Soviet programs during the decade. The most successful of these include the Soviet [[Lunokhod programme|Lunokhod]] program, a series of robotic lunar missions which included the first uncrewed [[sample return mission|sample return]] from another world, and the American [[Voyager program|Voyager]]s, which took advantage of a rare alignment of the outer planets to visit all of them except [[Pluto]] by the end of the 1980s.\n\nChina entered the space race in 1970 with the launching of its first [[satellite]], but technological backwardness and limited funds would prevent the country from becoming a significant force in space exploration. Japan launched a satellite for the first time in 1972. The [[European Space Agency]] was founded during the decade as well.\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Apollo 17 Cernan on moon.jpg|[[Apollo 17]] Astronaut [[Gene Cernan]] becomes the last man on the Moon, December 13, 1972\nFile:Apollo-Soyuz-Test-Program-artist-rendering.jpg|An artist impression of an American [[Apollo spacecraft]] and Soviet [[Soyuz spacecraft]] docking, a propaganda portrait for the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] mission\nFile:Skylab and Earth Limb - GPN-2000-001055.jpg|America's first space station [[Skylab]] in orbit February 8, 1974\nFile:Mars Viking 11h016.png|''[[Viking 1]]'', the first of two spacecraft sent to [[Mars]], takes this picture of the landing site in [[Chryse Planitia]] (1978)\nFile:Great Red Spot From Voyager 1.jpg|''[[Voyager 1]]'' passing by Jupiter's Great Red Spot February 25, 1979\n</gallery>\n\n====Biology====\n* The second generation of [[Rhytidectomy|face lifts]] were first attempted in the 1970s, popularizing the procedure for millions.\n* The first [[MRI]] image was published in 1973.\n* César Milstein and Georges Köhler reported their discovery of how to use hybridoma cells to isolate [[monoclonal antibodies]], effectively beginning the history of monoclonal antibody use in science.\n* [[Carl Woese]] and [[George E.

The [[1973 oil crisis]] caused a move towards smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles. Attempts were made to produce electric cars, but they were largely unsuccessful. In the United States, imported cars became a significant factor for the first time, and several domestic-built subcompact models entered the market.

[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] followed suit two years later, with [[Chrysler]] offering new small front-wheel-drive models, but was suffering from a worsening financial situation caused by various factors. By 1979, the company was near bankruptcy, and under its new president [[Lee Iacocca]] (who had been fired from Ford the year before), asked for a government bailout. [[American Motors]] beat out the U.S. [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] to subcompact sized model (the [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]]) in 1970, but its fortunes declined throughout the decade, forcing it into a partnership with the French automaker [[Renault]] in 1979.\n[[File:1973 Volvo sportwagon.JPG|thumb|1973 [[Volvo P1800]] sportwagon.]]\nEuropean car design underwent major changes during the 1970s due to the need for performance with high [[fuel efficiency]]—designs such as the [[Volkswagen Golf]] and Passat, [[BMW]] 3, 5, and 7 series, and [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] appeared at the latter half of the decade. Ford Europe, specifically Ford Germany, also eclipsed the profits of its American parent company. The designs of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] became dominant, along with those of Marcello Gandini in Italy. The 1970s also saw the decline and practical failure of the British car industry—a combination of militant strikes and poor quality control effectively halted development at [[British Leyland]], owner of all other British car companies during the 1970s.\n\nThe [[Japanese automobile industry]] flourished during the 1970s, compared to other major auto markets. Japanese vehicles became internationally renowned for their affordability, reliability, and fuel-efficiency, which was very important to many customers after the oil crisis of 1973. Japanese car manufacturing focused on computerized robotic manufacturing techniques and [[lean manufacturing]], contributing to high-efficiency and low production costs. The [[Honda Civic]] was introduced in 1973, and sold well due to its high fuel-efficiency.

However, by 4 May 1970, tensions arose again, and as the crowd grew larger, the National Guard started shooting. Four students were killed and nine were injured. This event caused disbelief and shock throughout the country and became a staple of anti-Vietnam demonstrations.\n\n====Environmentalism====\nThe 1970s started a mainstream affirmation of the [[environmentalism|environmental issues]] early activists from the 1960s, such as [[Rachel Carson]] and [[Murray Bookchin]], had warned of. The [[Apollo 11]] mission, which had occurred at the end of the previous decade, had transmitted back concrete images of the Earth as an integrated, life-supporting system and shaped a public willingness to preserve nature. On April 22, 1970, the United States celebrated its first [[Earth Day]], in which over two thousand colleges and universities and roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools participated.\n\n====Sexual Revolution====\n{{main|Sexual Revolution}}{{see|Golden Age of Porn|New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre}}\nThe 1960s counterculture movement had rapidly undone many existing social taboos, and divorce, extramarital sex, and homosexuality were increasingly accepted in the Western world. The event of legalized abortion and over-the-counter birth control pills also played a major factor. Western Europe was in some ways more progressive on sexual liberation than the United States, as [[nudity in film]] and on TV had been gradually accepted there from the mid-1960s, and many European countries during this time began allowing women to go topless in public places. Nudist culture was also popular during the decade, especially in Germany and Scandinavia. Child erotica found a niche market, but would eventually be banned under child pornography laws in the 1980s to 1990s.\n\nThe market for adult entertainment in the 1970s was large, and driven in part by the sizable baby boomer population, and the 1972 movie ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'', an X-rated feature, became one of the top-grossing films of the year. ''[[Playboy Magazine]]'' appeared increasingly dull and old-fashioned next to new, more explicit sex-themed magazines such as ''[[Penthouse Magazine]]'' and ''[[Hustler Magazine]]''.\n\nBy the end of the decade, there was an increasing backlash against libertine sexual attitudes, and the event of the [[AIDS epidemic]] helped bring about an end to the Sexual Revolution. Adult movie theaters, which had exploded in numbers during the 1970s and were widely seen as a symptom of [[urban decay]] in the US, declined as pornographic movies would largely shift to VHS tapes during the succeeding decade.\n\n====Crime and urban decay====\nCrime rates in the US had been low from the 1940s until the mid-1960s, but began to escalate after 1965 due to a complex of social, economic, and demographic factors. By the 1970s, crime and blighted urban areas were a serious cause of concern, New York City being particularly affected. In 1972, the US Supreme Court ruled capital punishment unconstitutional, then reversed the ruling only four years later. \n[[File:Leffler - WomensLib1970 WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|A Women's Liberation march in Washington, D.C., 1970]]\n\n====Feminism====\n{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}\nThe Second-Wave Feminist Movement in the United States, which had begun in the 1960s, carried over to the 1970s, and took a prominent role within society. The fiftieth anniversary of the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (which legalized female [[suffrage]]) in 1970 was commemorated by the Women's Strike for Equality and other protests.\n\n1971 saw [[Erin Pizzey]] establish the world's first domestic violence shelter in [[Chiswick]], London and Pizzey and her colleagues opened further facilities throughout the next few years. This work inspired similar networks of safe houses for female victims of abuse in other countries, with the first shelter in continental Europe opening in [[Amsterdam]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPPapvrJsTcC&pg=PA262|title=Family Violence|first1=Mildred Daley|last1=Pagelow|first2=Lloyd W.|last2=Pagelow|date=September 18, 1984|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books|isbn=9780275916237}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/03/domestic-violence-refuge-crisis-women-closure-safe-houses|title=Domestic violence refuge provision at crisis point, warn charities|first=Sandra|last=Laville|date=August 3, 2014|website=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nWith the anthology ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful]]'' and other works, such as ''[[Sexual Politics]]'', being published at the start of the decade, feminism started to reach a larger audience than ever before.  In addition, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s 1973 decision of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which constitutionalized the right to an abortion, brought the women's rights movement into the national political spotlight.\n\n[[Gloria Steinem]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Betty Ford]], [[Shirley Chisholm]], [[Bella Abzug]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Kate Millet]] and [[Elizabeth Holtzman]], among many others, led the movement for women's equality.\n\nEven musically, the women's movement had its shining moment.  Australian-American singer [[Helen Reddy]], recorded the song \"[[I Am Woman]]\", which became an anthem for the [[women's liberation movement]]. \"I Am Woman\" reached No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and even won Helen her one and only Grammy Award.\n\nAnother movement to arise was the 1970s [[Goddess movement]], which took place to combat patriarchal ideas of religion.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Denise|last=Dijk|title=The Goddess Movement in the U.S.A. A Religion for Women Only|journal=Archiv für Religionspsychologie / Archive for the Psychology of Religion|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23918114|publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|SAGE]]|pages=258–266|volume=18|date=1988|issue=1|doi=10.1163/157361288X00144|jstor=23918114|s2cid=178261133|access-date=2021-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|last=O'Brien|first=Jodi|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781452266022|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=709}}</ref>\n\nMost efforts of the movement, especially aims at social equality and repeal of the remaining oppressive, sexist laws, were successful. Doors of opportunity were more numerous and much further open than before as women gained unheard of success in business, politics, education, science, the law, and even [[homemaker|the home]]. Although most aims of the movement were successful, however, there were some significant failures, most notably the failure to ratify the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]] with only three more states needed to ratify it (efforts to ratify ERA in the unratified states continues to this day and twenty-two states have adopted state ERAs). Also, the [[Gender pay gap|wage gap]] failed to close, but it did become smaller.\n\nThe second wave feminist movement in the United States largely ended in 1982 with the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment, and with new conservative leadership in Washington, D.C..  American women created a brief, but powerful, [[Third-wave feminism|third-wave]] in the early 1990s which addressed [[sexual harassment]] (inspired by the [[Anita Hill]]–[[Clarence Thomas]] [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearings of 1991). The results of the movement included a new awareness of such issues among women, and unprecedented numbers of women elected to public office, [[Year of the Woman|particularly the United States Senate]].\n\n====Civil rights====\nThe Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s began to fracture in the 1970s, as social groups began defining themselves more by their differences than by their universalities. The Black Nationalist movement grew out of frustrations with the \"non-violent\" strategies of earlier Civil Rights Activists. With the April 1968 [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] and June 1968 [[assassination of Robert F. Kennedy]], many Black people were compelled to reject ideas of negotiation and instead embrace isolation. The feminist movement also splintered from a larger push for Civil Rights in the 1970s. The seventies were seen as the \"woman's turn\", though many feminists incorporated civil rights ideals into their movement. A feminist who had inherited the leadership position of the civil rights movement from her husband, [[Coretta Scott King]], as leader of the black movement, called for an end to all discrimination, helping and encouraging the [[Woman's Liberation]] movement, and other movements as well. At the [[National Women's Conference]] in 1977 a minority women's resolution, promoted by King and others, passed to ensure racial equality in the movement's goals. Similarly, the gay movement made a huge step forward in the 1970s with the election of political figures such as [[Harvey Milk]] to public office and the advocating of anti-gay discrimination legislation passed and not passed during the decade. Many celebrities, including [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Andy Warhol]], also \"[[Coming out|came out]]\" during this decade, bringing gay culture further into the limelight.\n\n====Youth suffrage====\n{{Main|Youth suffrage}}\nThe [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified on July 1, 1971, lowering the voting age for all federal and state elections from 21 years to 18 years. The primary impetus for this change was the fact that young men were being drafted to fight in the [[Vietnam War]] before they were old enough to vote.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Clyde |last2=Pluta Brown |first2=Gayle K. |title=Iowa University Towns and the Twenty-sixth Amendment: The First Test of the Newly Enfranchised Student Vote in 1971 |journal=The Annals of Iowa |date=Fall 2009 |volume=68 |issue=4 |page=398 |doi=10.17077/0003-4827.1380 |url=https://pubs.lib.uiowa.edu/annals-of-iowa/article/id/6038/download/pdf/ |access-date=20 July 2022|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n<gallery widths=\"190\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Atari-2600-Wood-4Sw-Set.png|The [[First generation of video game consoles|first]] and [[second generation of video game consoles|second]] generations of video game consoles like the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] and [[Atari 2600]] (pictured) were hits in the 1970s. \nFile:1976 Ford Gran Torino (Starsky and Hutch) 5.7.jpg|Action-oriented TV series like ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'' (pictured), ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', and ''[[Columbo]]'' were popular in the 1970s.\nFile:Philco-Ford Orange Retro TV (1970s).jpg| ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1970 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'', ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'', ''[[The Addams Family (1973 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'', and ''[[The Brady Kids]]'' were all popular cartoons of the 1970s.\nFile:Earth Wind and Fire.jpg|The [[disco]] genre was very popular in the decade.

In addition, many newcomer rock groups such as [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] appeared. [[The Beatles]] disbanded in 1970, but each member of the band immediately released a highly successful solo album, and [[Paul McCartney]] especially would remain extremely popular throughout the decade. Singer-songwriters such as [[Elton John]], [[James Taylor]] and [[Jackson Browne]] also came into vogue during the early 1970s.\n\nThe 1970s saw the rapid commercialization of rock music, and by mid-decade there were a spate of bands derisively dubbed \"corporate rock\" due to the notion that they had been created by record labels to produce simplistic, radio-friendly songs that offered clichés rather than meaningful lyrics. Such bands included [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Bread (band)|Bread]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], and [[REO Speedwagon]].\n\n[[Funk]], an offshoot of [[soul music]] with a greater emphasis on beats, and influences from [[rhythm and blues]], [[jazz]], and [[psychedelic rock]], was also very popular. The mid-1970s also saw the rise of [[disco]] music, which dominated during the last half of the decade with bands like the [[Bee Gees]], [[Chic (band)|Chic]], [[ABBA]], [[Village People]], [[Boney M]], [[Donna Summer]], [[KC and the Sunshine Band]], and others. In response to this, rock music became increasingly hard-edged, with early metal artists like [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Black Sabbath]], and [[Deep Purple]]. [[Minimalism]] also emerged, led by composers such as [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]] and [[Michael Nyman]]. This was a break from the intellectual serial music in the tradition of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], which lasted from the early 1900s to the 1960s.\n\nThe 1970s also saw artists from [[Motown|Motown records]] become popular across the globe. Artists like the [[The Jackson 5|Jackson 5]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Marvin Gaye]] dominated the record charts across the world and had a significant influence on pop culture, including breaking down racial barriers.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Haider|first=Arwa|title=Motown: The music that changed America|url=https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20190109-motown-the-music-that-changed-america|access-date=2021-04-09|website=www.bbc.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jimmy Page with Robert Plant 2 - Led Zeppelin - 1977.jpg|240px|thumb|right|British rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] was one of the most popular and influential bands of the 1970s. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].]]\n\nClassical and experimental music influenced both [[art rock]] and [[progressive rock]] genres with bands such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Todd Rundgren's Utopia]], [[Supertramp]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[King Crimson]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[The Moody Blues]] and [[Soft Machine]]. [[Hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] also emerged among British bands [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Who]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]], and [[Judas Priest]].\nAustralian band [[AC/DC]] also found its hard-rock origins in the early 1970s and its breakthrough in 1979's ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', while popular American rock bands included [[Aerosmith]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[shock rock]]ers [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]], [[Blue Öyster Cult]], and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and guitar-oriented [[Ted Nugent]] and [[Van Halen]]. In Europe, there was a surge of popularity in the early decade for [[glam rock]].\n\nAfter a successful return to live performing in the late 60s with his [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|TV special]], [[Elvis Presley]] remained popular in [[Las Vegas|Vegas]] and on concert tours throughout the United States until his death in 1977. His 1973 televised concert, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite]]'', aired in over 40 countries in Europe and Asia, as well as the United States, making it one of the most popular concert events of the decade.\n\nThe second half of the decade saw the rise of [[punk rock]], when a spate of fresh, young rock groups playing stripped-down hard rock came to prominence at a time when most of the artists associated with the 1960s to early 1970s were in creative decline. Punk bands included [[The Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], [[The Ramones]], [[The Talking Heads]], and more.\n\n[[File:DarkSideOfTheMoon1973.jpg|240px|thumb|left|[[Pink Floyd]] performing ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' in 1973, the highest-selling album of the decade and one of the highest-selling of all time.]]\n\nThe highest-selling album of the decade was [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973), along with [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' (1976) and [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977). ''Dark Side of the Moon'' remained on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart for 741 weeks. Electronic instrumental progressive rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like [[Kraftwerk]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Can (band)|Can]], and [[Faust (band)|Faust]] to circumvent the language barrier. Their synthesiser-heavy \"[[krautrock]]\", along with the work of [[Brian Eno]] (for a time the keyboard player with [[Roxy Music]]), would be a major influence on subsequent [[synthrock]].<ref name=\"Bogdanov2002Prog\">Unterberger, 2002, pp. 1330–1.</ref> The mid-1970s saw the rise of [[electronic art music]] musicians such as [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Vangelis]], and [[Isao Tomita|Tomita]], who with Brian Eno were a significant influence of the development of [[new-age music]]. Japanese band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] helped to pioneer synthpop, with their [[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|self-titled album]] (in [[1978 in music|1978]]) setting a template with less minimalism and with a strong emphasis on melody, and drawing from a wider range of influences than had been employed by [[Kraftwerk]]. [[Yellow Magic Orchestra|YMO]] also introduced the microprocessor-based [[Roland MC-8 Microcomposer|Roland MC-8]] sequencer and [[TR-808]] rhythm machine to popular music.\n\nIn the first half of the 1970s, many jazz musicians from the [[Miles Davis]] school achieved cross-over success through [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]] with bands like [[Weather Report]], [[Return to Forever]], [[The Headhunters]] and [[The Mahavishnu Orchestra]] who also influenced this genre and many others. In Germany, [[Manfred Eicher]] started the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] label, which quickly made a name for \"chamber jazz\". Towards the end of the decade, Jamaican [[reggae]] music, already popular in the Caribbean and Africa since the early 1970s, became very popular in the U.S. and in Europe, mostly because of reggae superstar and legend [[Bob Marley]]. The mid-1970s saw the reemergence of acoustic jazz with the return of artists like [[Dexter Gordon]] to the US music scene, who, along with a number of other artists, such as trumpet innovators like [[Don Ellis]] and [[Woody Shaw]], who were among the last of the decade's traditionally-oriented acoustic jazz musicians to be signed to major record labels, to receive critical and widespread commercial recognition and multiple Grammy nominations.\n\n[[File:QueenPerforming1977.jpg|thumb|British rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (pictured here in 1977) was considered to be one of the most influential bands of the '70s (as well as the '80s), along with American rock band [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and others]]\n\nThe late 1970s also saw the beginning of [[hip hop music]] with disc jockeys like [[DJ Kool Herc]] and [[Afrika Bambaataa]] taking loops from funk and soul records and playing them repeatedly at block parties and dance clubs. At the end of the 1970s, popular songs like \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\" by [[Sugarhill Gang]] gave hip hop a wider audience. Hip hop was also influenced by the song \"[[The Revolution Will Not Be Televised]]\" by [[Gil Scott-Heron]].\n\n[[Country music]] also continued to increase in popularity in the 1970s. Between 1977 and 1979, it became more mainstream, particularly with the [[outlaw country|outlaw movement]], led by [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. The 70s also saw the rise of a country music subgenre, [[southern rock]], led by the [[Allman Brothers Band]]. Other artists; such as [[Conway Twitty]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Don Williams]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[Crystal Gayle]], and [[Barbara Mandrell]]; all scored hits throughout the 70s which reached both country and pop charts. The genre also saw its golden age of vocal [[duet|duo]]s and [[vocal group|group]]s in this decade; with [[Conway Twitty]] and [[Loretta Lynn]], [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Jim Ed Brown]] and [[Helen Cornelius]], the [[Bellamy Brothers]], the [[Oak Ridge Boys]], the [[Statler Brothers]], [[Dave & Sugar]], and [[The Kendalls]]. The genre also became more involved in [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] toward the end of the decade, with country-themed action films such as ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and ''[[Every Which Way But Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'', a trend that continued into the early 80s with ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' and ''[[Bronco Billy]]''.\n\nA major event in music in the early 1970s was the deaths of popular rock stars [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Jim Morrison]], all at the age of 27.

[[German New Wave]] and [[Rainer Fassbinder]]'s existential movies characterized film-making in Germany. The movies of the Swedish director [[Ingmar Bergman]] reached a new level of expression in motion pictures like ''[[Cries and Whispers]]'' (1973).\n\n''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' was released in 1970, spawning the [[Disaster film|air disaster film]] genre. Throughout the decade, the film inspired three sequels: ''[[Airport 1975]], [[Airport '77]], and [[The Concorde: Airport '79]]''. The genre also inspired a spoof film (''[[Airplane!]]'') along with its two sequels in the early 1980s. A slew of other air disaster films followed suit throughout the 1980s and well into the 1990s, primarily in made-for-TV movies.\n\n[[Car chase]] movies also became a popular film genre of the 1970s with such films as ''[[Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry]]'' in 1974, and perhaps the genre's most popular film ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' in 1977.\n[[File:ZubaidaTharwat&SalahZulfikar.jpg|alt=ZubaidaTharwat&SalahZulfikar|thumb|210x210px|[[Salah Zulfikar]] and [[Zubaida Tharwat]] in ''[[The Other Man (1973 film)|The Other Man]]'' (1973)]]\nAsian cinema of the 1970s catered to the rising middle class fantasies and struggles. In the [[Bollywood]] cinema of India, this was epitomized by the movies of Bollywood superhero [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. Another Asian touchstone beginning in the early 1970s was [[Hong Kong martial arts film]] which sparked a greater interest in Chinese martial arts around the world. [[Martial arts film]] reached the peak of its popularity largely in part due to its greatest icon, [[Bruce Lee]].\nDuring the 1970s, Hollywood continued the [[New Hollywood]] movement of the late-1960s with young filmmakers like [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[George Lucas]], [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Steven Spielberg]], as well as films like ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''. Top-grossing ''Jaws'' (1975) ushered in the [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] era of filmmaking, though it was eclipsed two years later by the science-fiction film ''Star Wars'' (1977). ''Saturday Night Fever'' (1977) single-handedly touched off disco mania in the U.S. ''The Godfather'' (1972) was also one of the decade's greatest successes and its first follow-up, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974) was also successful for a sequel.\n\n''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' flopped in its 1975 debut, only to reappear as a more-popular midnight show later in the decade. Still in limited release decades after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history.\n\n''[[The Exorcist]]'' (1973) was a box office success for the horror genre, inspiring many other so-called \"devil (Satan)\" films like ''[[The Omen]]'' and both of their own sequels. The release of the movie followed a general mood of paranoia on satanic themes in the United States; also the counterculture of the 1970s saw an increasing interest in [[occultism]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Simon |first=Ed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gahEEAAAQBAJ |title=Pandemonium: A Visual History of Demonology |date= |publisher=Abrams |year=2022 |isbn=978-1-64700-389-0 |pages=369-370 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'' (1979) gained high critical praise, winning four Oscars and several other awards.

However, many viewers continued to watch black-and-white television sets for most of the decade, which meant for example that televised [[snooker]] (in which the colour of balls is important) did not reach the heights of its popularity until the 1980s.\n\nNotable dramas included ''[[Play for Today]]'' and ''[[Pennies from Heaven (TV series)|Pennies from Heaven]]''. In police dramas, there was a move towards increasing realism; popular shows included ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'', ''[[Z-Cars]]'', ''[[Softly, Softly (television series)|Softly, Softly]]'', and ''[[The Sweeney]]''.\n\nThe science fiction show ''[[Doctor Who]]'' reached its peak.\n\n1970s UK television featured a mix of traditional and more modern comedy. ''[[Morecambe and Wise]]'', ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'', ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' and ''[[Dad's Army]]'' had their origins in the variety show and radio comedy of the first half of the century. Many popular British [[situation comedy|situation comedies]] (sit-coms) were gentle, unchallenging comedies of middle-class life; typical examples were ''[[Terry and June]]'' and ''[[Sykes (TV series)|Sykes]]''. However, the middle-class settings of ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'' and ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'' contrasted with their anti-establishment theme of people rejecting traditional social norms. A harsher side of society was shown by comedy series like ''[[Porridge (1974 TV series)|Porridge]]'' and ''[[Rising Damp]]'', while sitcoms such as ''[[Mind Your Language]]'', ''[[Love Thy Neighbour (1972 TV series)|Love Thy Neighbour]]'' and ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'' reflected social unease brought about by post-war immigration. [[Spike Milligan]]'s ''[[Q (TV series)|Q]]'' and the still-popular ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' both used surreal comedy, originating from the 1950s ''[[The Goon Show]]''.\n\nThe television information retrieval service [[Teletext]] was initially introduced when the BBC [[Ceefax]] system went live on 23 September 1974.\n\nIn the late 1970s, BBC2's unveiled a new identity, a twin-striped \"2\", which was the first electronically generated symbol and scrolled on and off the screen.\n\n====United States====\n[[File:Redd Foxx Demond Wilson Sanford and Son 1972.JPG|thumb|right|[[Redd Foxx]] and [[Demond Wilson]] from ''[[Sanford and Son]]'']]\n\nAs the 1970s began, the Big Three TV networks were rapidly re-engineering their lineups, noting that existing programs were not attracting the youth audience. Most existing programs still operated on paradigms established in the 1950s, and some shows had literally been on the air since the dawn of TV broadcasting in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Shows that had low ratings or insufficient youth appeal were cancelled as networks scrambled to attract the large [[baby boomer]] audience.\n\nTo reflect the new social trends, television changed dramatically with more urban and edgy settings, and replaced the popular rural/country wholesome look of the 1950s and 1960s, seen as outmoded and unable to connect with young, educated urban audiences. This particular trend was known as the [[rural purge]]. Television was transformed by what became termed as \"social consciousness\" programming, such as ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', which broke down television barriers. Many advertising trends of the 1970s also reflected this growing social consciousness trend, such as with Coca-Cola's \"Give the World a Coke\" and Mcdonalds' \"You Deserve a Break\" campaigns.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1970s Advertising Campaigns that Affected Pop Culture|url=https://frahmdigital.com/70s-commercials/|website=Frahm Digital|date=6 October 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe women's movement ushered in a slew of programming featuring strong, independent females as central characters. Most notable was ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', which spawned the successful spin-offs ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'', and also resulted in Mary Tyler Moore becoming the first female to head a television production company of her own, [[MTM Enterprises]], which churned out groundbreaking programming in the late 1970s throughout the 1990s. Women were also established portraying action characters in programs like ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'', ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', and others.\n\nMinority-centric television programming also featured prominently during the 1970s. Shows featuring African-Americans as main characters, such as ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', ''[[Good Times]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' and ''[[What's Happening!!]]'' broke down barriers and became very popular. In addition, ''[[Soul Train]]'', the brainchild of [[Don Cornelius]], premiered in 1971 as the African-American counterpart to ''[[American Bandstand]]'', giving a forum for [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[jazz]], [[R&B]], [[disco]], and future [[rap]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists to gain exposure to American audiences, consumers, music lovers, enthusiasts, and those keen on learning new dance moves.\n\nThe television [[western (genre)|western]], which had been very popular in the 1950s and 1960s, all but died out during the 1970s, with ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' ending their runs. Replacing westerns were police and detective shows, a trend that would last through the 1980s.\n\nTelevision still had its medical shows of the 1970s, however, ''[[Emergency!]]'' was the first popular [[medical drama]] ever to feature both the paramedic program as well as the hospital emergency department, which also encouraged future people in the United States to develop their own paramedic program or hospital emergency department, and acted as an inspiration for many individuals. ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'' and ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]'' were other long-running medical dramas popular during the 1970s.\n\n1950s nostalgia became a theme in prime time sitcoms with the [[Garry Marshall]]-produced ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its two [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and ''[[Mork & Mindy]]''.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 1970s, \"[[jiggle television]]\"—programs oriented toward sexual gratification and [[farce]] comedy and situations—became popular.  Such programs included ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', and perhaps the genre's most popular, ''[[Three's Company]]''.\n\nSoap operas expanded their audiences beyond [[housewives]] with the rise of ''[[All My Children]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[Somerset]]'', and ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''; with many extending their episodes from 30 minutes to an hour. The soap ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' began a 16-month experiment in March 1979 by screening 90-minute episodes, the only serial to do so.\n\n[[Game shows]] such as ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'', ''[[Family Feud]]'', and many others saw its golden age on [[Daytime television in the United States|daytime television]]. The height of ''Match Game''{{'}}s popularity occurred between 1973 and 1977, before it was overtaken by ''Family Feud'' in 1978. Television's current longest-running game show, ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', began its run hosted by [[Bob Barker]] in 1972.\n\nAnother influential genre was the television newscast, which built on its initial widespread success in the 1960s.\n\nThe science fiction phenomenon of the late 1970s that began with ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' went to television with shows such as ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.\n\n[[Variety shows]], a staple of TV programming since the beginning, were also re-engineered to appeal to young viewers. Old standbys such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' were canceled and replaced by hipper programming like ''[[Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny & Marie]]''. ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' also ended its historic 11-year run in 1978. In the end, rising production costs largely did in variety shows. The exception was ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (then known as ''NBC's Saturday Night''), which was created by [[Lorne Michaels]] and premiered in 1975, with an original cast of [[Laraine Newman]], [[John Belushi]], [[Jane Curtin]], [[Gilda Radner]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Garrett Morris]], and [[Chevy Chase]].\n\n=====Pay television=====\nAs cable television became more affordable and accessible by U.S. consumers, the race to bring the silver screen to the small screen commenced with the launch of [[pay television]] services showing premium content.\n\n[[HBO]] launched on November 8, 1972, becoming the nation's first pay-television channel. On September 30, 1975, HBO became the first television network to continuously deliver signals via satellite when it showed the \"[[Thrilla in Manila]]\" boxing match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]].\n\nStar Channel launched its service offerings nationally in 1973 through the delivery of movies on videotapes for cable providers to broadcast. This proved problematic since the videotapes were often riddled with technical difficulties. Star Channel eventually was linked up to satellite in January 1978. Shortly after, Warner Communications acquired the channel and relaunched it on December 1, 1979, in its current form as [[The Movie Channel]].\n\nMedia giant [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] launched their premium service, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], nationally on July 1, 1976, after a brief, wildly successful test launch on their cable system in [[Dublin, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/corporate-profile-showtime|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629195653/http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/corporate-profile-showtime|url-status=dead|title=Corporate profile: Showtime - Marketplace.org|date=29 June 2012|archive-date=29 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Australia====\nIn 1974, Australian TV tested color transmissions (full-time color came in 1975). Popular shows during the decade include, ''[[Young Talent Time]]'', ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', ''[[The Aunty Jack Show]]'', ''[[Class of '74]]'', ''[[The Sullivans]]'', ''[[The Don Lane Show]]'', ''[[Cop Shop]]'', ''[[The Naked Vicar Show]]'', ''[[The Paul Hogan Show]]'' and ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]''.\n\n====South Africa====\nSouth Africa saw nationwide television service for the first time on January 5, 1976, although limited-view, locally available television began on May 5, 1975.\n\n===Computer and video games===\n[[File:Pong bs.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Pong]] (1972)]]\n[[File:Milton-Bradley-Microvision-Handheld-FL.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Microvision]] (1979) is the very first handheld game console that used interchangeable cartridges.]]\n{{Main|1970s in video games}}\n{{See also|History of video games#1970s}}\n\n* Popular and notable video games of the 1970s include: ''[[Space Invaders]]'', ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'', ''[[Pong]]'', and ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]''.\n* [[Golden age of video arcade games]]\n* ''[[Gun Fight]]'' was the first video game to contain a [[microprocessor]].\n* ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' was the first publicly available educational video game made available for widespread use in schools on December 3, 1971. The game is a cult classic and is still used today, in a wide variety of formats, through emulators and on smartphones.\n* The first commercially available video game console, entitled [[Magnavox Odyssey]], was released in September 1972, created by [[Ralph H. Baer]].\n*[[1974 in video gaming|1974]]: Both ''[[Maze War]]'' (on the [[Imlac PDS-1]] at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] in California) and ''[[Spasim]]'' (on PLATO) appeared, pioneering examples of early multiplayer 3D [[first-person shooter]]s.\n* In 1976, [[Mattel]] introduced the first [[handheld electronic game]] with the release of [[Mattel Auto Race]].\n* Then, in 1976, [[William Crowther (computer programmer)|William Crowther]] wrote the first modern text adventure game, [[Colossal Cave Adventure]].\n* [[Apple, Inc.]] ushered in the modern personal computing age with its June 1, 1977, launch of the first mass-produced personal computer, the [[Apple&nbsp;II]]. Although many business-focused personal workstations were available to corporations years earlier, the Apple&nbsp;II has the distinction of being the first to produce personal computers specifically targeted to home users, beating the [[Commodore PET]] and [[Atari 400]] to the market by five months. Its initial price tag was US$4999.99 for the [[CPU]] only.\n* The [[Atari 2600]] was released in October 1977 and was a huge commercial success. It was challenged by the [[Magnavox Odyssey²]] and [[Intellivision]].\n* [[Fairchild Channel F]] from 1976 becomes the first programmable [[ROM cartridge]]-based video game console.\n* The [[Microvision]] was the very first hand-held game console using interchangeable cartridges. It was released by the [[Milton Bradley Company]] in November 1979.\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|1970s in sports}}\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, Germany saw swimmer [[Mark Spitz]] set seven World Records and won a record seven gold medals. The [[1976 Summer Olympics]] were held in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada. Brazil won the [[FIFA World Cup 1970|1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico, West Germany won the [[FIFA World Cup 1974|1974 FIFA World Cup]] in West Germany, and Argentina won the [[FIFA World Cup 1978|1978 FIFA World Cup]] in Argentina. The [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] was the first world cup to be televised in color.\n\nOn April 9, 1975, Asia's first professional basketball league, the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (PBA) had its first game at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum|Araneta Coliseum]] in Cubao, [[Quezon City]], Philippines.\n\n====United States====\nThe [[Oakland Athletics]] three-peated at the World Series in [[1972 World Series|1972]]–[[1974 World Series|1974]].\n\nThe [[Cincinnati Reds]] go to the [[World Series]] in [[1970 World Series|1970]], [[1972 World Series|1972]], [[1975 World Series|1975]], and [[1976 World Series|1976]], led by the [[Big Red Machine]] winning two out of four.\n\nThe [[New York Yankees]] won the World Series in [[1977 World Series|1977]] and [[1978 World Series|1978]] after losing in [[1976 World Series|1976]].\n\nThe [[Dallas Cowboys]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] dominated the decade in the NFL. Steelers were led by [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Chuck Noll]], and the Cowboys were led by [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Tom Landry]], while the [[Miami Dolphins]] became the only team in NFL history to go \"all the way,\" winning the [[Super Bowl]] with an [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|undefeated record]]—a feat that remains unmatched to this day.\n\nThe [[Philadelphia Flyers]] won the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[1974 Stanley Cup Finals|1974]] and [[1975 Stanley Cup Finals|1975]], a team best remembered as \"The Broad Street Bullies\".\n\n====Disc sports (Frisbee)====\nAs numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They would form what would become known as the [[counterculture]]. The forms of escape and resistance would manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[frisbee]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Countercultural Sports in America: The History and Meaning of Ultimate Frisbee|first=Jordan |last=Holtzman-Conston |publisher=Waltham, Mass|year= 2010|isbn=978-3838311951}}</ref> What started with a few players like Victor Malafronte, Z Weyand and [[Ken Westerfield]] experimenting with new ways of throwing and catching a frisbee, later would become known as playing [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Freestyle Players Hall of Fame Pioneer Class|work=FPA Hall of Fame|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/hall-of-fame/|access-date=October 3, 2017|archive-date=April 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426195915/http://www.freestyledisc.org/hall-of-fame/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Organized disc sports, in the 1970s, began with promotional efforts from [[Wham-O]] and [[Irwin Toy]] (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using frisbee show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Frisbee and Flying Disc freestyle|work=Formative Years Frisbee Sports|url=http://www.freestyledisc.org/freestyle-history/#chapter2|access-date=October 3, 2017|date=2017-05-11}}</ref> Disc sports such as freestyle, [[double disc court]], [[Guts (flying disc game)|guts]], [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] became this sports first events.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/|work=WFDF Official Website|access-date=October 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-flying-disc|work=History of the Flying Disc|access-date=October 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|1970s in literature}}\nFiction in the early 1970s brought a return to old-fashioned storytelling, especially with [[Erich Segal]]'s ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''. The seventies also saw the decline of previously well-respected writers, such as [[Saul Bellow]] and [[Peter De Vries]], who both released poorly received novels at the start of the decade. Racism remained a key literary subject. [[John Updike]] emerged as a major literary figure. Reflections on the 1960s experience also found roots in the literature of the decade through the works of [[Joyce Carol Oates]] and [[Wright Morris]]. With the rising cost of hard-cover books and the increasing readership of \"[[genre fiction]]\", the paperback became a popular medium. Criminal non-fiction also became a popular topic. Irreverence and satire, typified in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', were common literary elements. The horror genre also emerged, and by the late 1970s [[Stephen King]] had become one of the most popular [[genre novelist]]s. The [[postmodern]] author [[Thomas Pynchon]] published his most famous work, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', in 1973.\n\nIn non-fiction, several books related to Nixon and the [[Watergate scandal]] topped the best-selling lists. 1977 brought many high-profile biographical works of literary figures, such as those of [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Agatha Christie]], and [[J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. Tolkien]].\n\nThe [[List of fake memoirs and journals|fake memoir]] ''[[Go Ask Alice]]'' was released in 1971. Upon its initial release the book was marketed as a real diary of a teenage girl who overdosed in the 1960s. However, it was later revealed that the book was actually written by [[Beatrice Sparks]].\n\n===Architecture===\n{{multiple image\n| direction         = horizontal\n| width1            = 118\n| width2            = 130\n| footer            = \n| image1            = World Trade Center, New York City - aerial view (March 2001).jpg\n| alt1              = \n| caption1          = The [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] towers were the world's tallest buildings from 1972 to 1973.\n| image2            = Sears Tower ss.jpg\n| alt2              = \n| caption2          = The [[Sears Tower]] became the world's tallest building when completed in 1973.\n}}\n\n[[File:CN Tower 1976.jpg|100px|thumb|The [[CN Tower]] was completed in 1976, becoming the world's tallest free-standing structure.]]\nArchitecture in the 1970s began as a continuation of styles created by such architects as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. Early in the decade, several architects competed to build the tallest building in the world. Of these buildings, the most notable are the [[John Hancock Center]] and [[Sears Tower]] in Chicago, both designed by [[Bruce Graham]] and [[Fazlur Khan]], and the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] towers in New York by American architect [[Minoru Yamasaki]]. The decade also brought experimentation in geometric design, [[pop-art]], [[postmodernism]], and early [[deconstructivism]].\n\nDesign trends in the 1970s were marked by a backlash against the bright colors and futurism of the 1950s and 1960s and a rise in popularity of dark, earthy tones with extensive use of brown, green, purple, and orange. Wood decor and paneling was integral to 1970s interior design as well, replacing the obsession of the 1950s and 1960s with chrome and aluminum. Darker colors not only reflected the back-to-nature mindset of the decade, but the sluggish world economy with its lowered optimism and expectations for the future.\n\nIn 1974, [[Louis Kahn]]'s last and arguably most famous building, the National Assembly Building of [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh, was completed. The building's use of open spaces and groundbreaking geometry brought rare attention to the small South Asian country. [[Hugh Stubbins]]'s [[Citigroup Center|Citicorp Center]] revolutionized the incorporation of solar panels in office buildings. The seventies brought further experimentation in glass and steel construction and geometric design. Chinese architect [[I. M. Pei]]'s [[John Hancock Tower]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, is an example, although like many buildings of the time, the experimentation was flawed and glass panes fell from the façade. In 1976, the completed [[CN&nbsp;Tower]] in Toronto became the world's tallest free-standing structure on land, an honor it held until 2007. The fact that no taller tower had been built between the construction of the CN Tower and the [[Burj Khalifa]] shows how innovative the architecture and engineering of the structure truly were.\n\nModern architecture was increasingly criticized as the decade went on from the point of view of postmodern architects, such as [[Philip Johnson]], Charles Moore, and [[Michael Graves]], who advocated a return to pre-modern styles of architecture and the incorporation of pop elements as a means of communicating with a broader public. Other architects, such as [[Peter Eisenman]] of the [[New York Five]], advocated the pursuit of form for the sake of form and drew on semiotics theory for support.\n\n\"High Tech\" architecture moved forward as [[Buckminster Fuller]] continued his experiments in [[geodesic domes]], while the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Georges Pompidou Center]], designed by [[Renzo Piano]] and [[Richard Rogers]], which opened in 1977, was a prominent example. As the decade drew to a close, [[Frank Gehry]] broke out in a new direction with his own house in Santa Monica, a highly complex structure, half excavated out of an existing bungalow and half cheaply built construction using materials such as chicken wire fencing.\n\n[[Terracotta Army]] figures, dating from 210 BC, were discovered in 1974 by some local farmers in Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China, near the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor (Chinese: 秦始皇陵; pinyin: Qín Shǐhuáng Ling). In 1978, electrical workers in [[Mexico City]] found the remains of the [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] in the middle of the city.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1970s in fashion}}\nClothing styles during the 1970s were influenced by outfits seen in popular music groups and in Hollywood films.<ref name=collectorsweekly>[http://www.collectorsweekly.com/1970s \"Time Machine > 1970s\".

As well as the hippie look, the 70s also gave way to [[glam rock]] styles, started off by [[David Bowie]] who was named the King of Glam Rock. Glam was a [[genderbent]] and outlandish style.\n\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1970s include:\n\n* [[Bell-bottoms|Bell-bottomed pants]] remained popular throughout the decade. These combined with [[Polo neck|turtle necked shirts]] and flower-prints to form the characteristic 1970s look. In the later part of the decade, this gave way to three-piece suits, in large part because of the movie ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''.\n* [[Sideburn]]s were popular for men, particularly mutton chops; as were [[beard]]s and [[mustaches]] which had been out of fashion since the 19th and early 20th century.\n* Women's hairstyles went from long and straight in the first half of the decade to the feathery cut of [[Farrah Fawcett]], a trend that continued through the first half of the 1980s. \n* [[Miniskirt]]s and [[minidress]]es were still popular in the first half of the decade, particularly with pleated \"rah-rah\" skirts with higher hemlines; but they were quickly phased out by the mid-70s in favor of [[hot pants]]. However, miniskirts and minidresses never totally went away, and they made a return to mainstream fashion in the mid-1980s and has remained a fashion staple in the decades since.\n* [[Crop top]]s and

In the built environment, the [[McMansion]] version of [[postmodern architecture]] remained strong throughout the decade. Public education about [[safe sex]] curbed the spread of the [[HIV]] virus in developed countries. [[Generation X]] young people often bonded over musical tastes. Humor in television and film was often marked by ironic [[self-reference]] mixed with [[popular culture]] references. Alternative music movements like [[grunge]], [[Eurodance]], and [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], became popular with young adults worldwide, aided by the rise in popularity of tiered pricing [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[cable television]], and the [[internet]]. New music genres such as [[drum and bass]], [[post-rock]], [[happy hardcore]], ''[[denpa song|denpa]]'', and [[trance music|trance]] emerged in the 1990s. The computer game industry began to boom again, the rivalry of music and film markets. Video game popularity exploded due to the development of [[CD-ROM]] supported [[3D computer graphics|3DCG]] on platforms such as [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Nintendo 64]], and [[Personal computer|PC]]s.\n\nThe 1990s saw advances in [[#Science and technology|technology]], with the [[World Wide Web]], the evolution of the [[Pentium (original)|Pentium microprocessor]] in accordance with [[Moore's Law]], rechargeable [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]], the first [[gene therapy]] trial, and [[cloning]] all emerging and being improved upon throughout the decade. The [[Human Genome Project]] was formally launched in 1990, building of the [[Large Hadron Collider]] commenced in 1998, and [[Nasdaq]] (established 1971) became the first stock market in the United States to trade online, using the slogan \"the stock market for the next hundred years\".<ref>https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/wealth-management/nasdaq/|Corporate{{Dead link|date=July 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Finance Institute</ref>\n\n[[#Environment|Environmentalism]] was divided between left-wing [[green politics]], [[primary industry]]-sponsored environmentalist [[front organization]]s, and a more business-oriented approach to the regulation of [[carbon footprint]] of businesses. As more businesses were using [[information technology]], the idea of the [[paperless office]] became a realistic long-term goal. The matter of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs) was an ongoing concern. In 1995, the Governing Council of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) called for global action to be taken on these \"chemical substances that persist in the environment, bio-accumulate through the food web, and pose a risk of causing adverse effects to human health and the environment\". The Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS) and the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) then prepared an assessment of the 12 worst chemical substances, leading to the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] of 2001.\n\nA combination of factors led to a realignment and consolidation of [[#Economics|economic]] and political power across the world, such as the continued mass-mobilization of [[capital market]]s through the wave of [[neoliberalism]], [[globalization]], and the end of the [[Cold War]] caused by the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. Network cultures were enhanced by the widespread proliferation of [[#Internet|new media]] such as the internet, and a new ability to self-publish web pages and make positive connections on a wide variety of professional, political and hobby topics. The new medium was dubbed the [[information superhighway]] and soon used by the so-called 'tech savvy'. The [[digital divide]] was immediate, with access to the World Wide Web limited to those who could afford it and knew how to operate a home or business computer. The internet also provided a degree of anonymity for individuals skeptical of the government. Online [[anonymity]] and the semi-impersonal nature of communication by email and [[chat room]]s led to the words [[Troll (slang)|troll]] and [[Etiquette in technology|netiquette]] enter the English language. Online scammers and sex offenders scared many people off the idea of home internet, and traditional mass media continued to perform strongly. However, mainstream internet users were optimistic about its benefits particularly the future of [[e-commerce]]. [[Web portal]]s, (such as AOL, [[Yahoo!]], [[Yahoo! GeoCities]] and [[Lycos]]), a type of curated bookmark homepage, were as popular as searching via [[web crawler]]s. The use of country-specific web portals popularized the phrases [[netizen]] and [[global village]]. The [[dot-com bubble]] of 1997–2000 brought great wealth to some [[entrepreneur]]s before its [[Stock market downturn of 2002|crash of the early-2000s]].\n\nMany countries were economically prosperous and spreading [[globalization]] during the 1990s. [[World Bank high-income economy|High-income countries]] experienced steady economic growth throughout the majority of the decade during the [[Great Moderation]] (1980s—2000s). Using a [[mobile phone]] in a public place was typical [[conspicuous consumption]] in the decade. In contrast, the [[GDP]] of the states of the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] declined, as a result of neoliberal restructuring. [[International trade]] increased with the passage of the establishments of the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993, the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) in 1994, and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 1995. The [[Asia-Pacific]] economies of the [[Four Asian Tigers]] (Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea), [[ASEAN]], Australia and Japan were hampered by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and the [[early 1990s recession]] (including the [[Lost Decades]]), resulted the [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia]], the [[1996 Australian federal election]] and the [[Anwar Ibrahim sodomy trials|trials on Anwar Ibrahim]], marked the dawn of the 32-year [[Suharto]] [[New Order (Indonesia)|dictatorship]], the [[Hawke–Keating government]] and [[Reformasi (Malaysia)|Mahathirism]] in Malaysia.\n\nMajor wars that began in the 1990s include the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s, the [[Rwandan Civil War]] and [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]], the [[Burundian Civil War]], the [[Somali Civil War]], the [[Algerian Civil War]], and the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] in [[Africa]]; the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in  [[Southeast Europe]]; the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s, and the [[Tajikistani Civil War]] in the former Soviet Union; and the [[Gulf War]] and [[1991 Iraqi uprisings]] in the [[Middle East]]. The [[Afghanistan conflict (1978–present)]] and [[Colombian conflict]] continued throughout the decade. The [[Oslo Accords]] at first seemed to herald an end to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], but these hopes were in vain. However, in [[Northern Ireland]], [[The Troubles]] came to a standstill in 1998 with the [[Good Friday Agreement]], ending 30 years of violence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|title=The Roaring Nineties|publisher=W.

President [[Saddam Hussein]] accused [[Kuwait]] of flooding the oil market, therefore driving down prices. As a result, Iraqi forces [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded and conquered Kuwait]]. \n**The UN ([[United Nations]]) immediately condemned the action and a coalition force led by the [[United States]] was sent to the [[Persian Gulf]]. [[Gulf War air campaign|Aerial bombing of Iraq]] began in January 1991, and one month later, the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from Kuwait in four days.\n*Two wars were fought in the region of [[Chechnya]]:\n**The [[First Chechen War]] (1994–1996) was a conflict between the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]]. After the initial campaign of 1994–1995, culminating in the devastating [[Battle of Grozny (August 1996)|Battle of Grozny]], Russian federal forces attempted to seize control of the mountainous area of Chechnya. Despite Russia's overwhelming manpower, weaponry, and [[air support]], they were set back by Chechen [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] and raids on the flatlands. The resulting widespread demoralization of Russian federal forces, and the universal{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s government to declare a [[ceasefire]] in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later.\n**The [[Second Chechen War]] (1999 – 2009) was started by the Russian Federation in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan (1999)|1999 invasion of Dagestan]] and the [[Russian apartment bombings]], which were blamed on the Chechens. In this military campaign, Russian forces largely recaptured the separatist region of Chechnya{{citation needed|date=April 2023}} and the outcome of the First Chechen War – in which the region gained de facto independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria – was essentially reversed.\n*The [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]] (1998–2000) was commenced by the invasion of Ethiopia by Eritrea due to a territorial dispute.<ref>{{cite news |date=2005-12-21 |title=International commission: Eritrea triggered the border war with Ethiopia |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4548754.stm |access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref> The conflict resulted in tens of thousands of deaths on both sides<ref name=\"Tens-of-thousands\">Tens of thousands [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1053983.stm Eritrea: Final deal with Ethiopia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060224212710/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1053983.stm |date=24 February 2006 }} BBC 4 December 2000\n* [http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/12/07/news/eritrea.php Eritrea orders Westerners in UN mission out in 10 days] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619042941/http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/12/07/news/eritrea.php |date=19 June 2008 }}, [[International Herald Tribune]], 7 December 2005</ref> and a peace agreement in December 2000.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2000-12-11 |title=Horn peace deal: Full text |language=en-GB |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1066401.stm |access-date=2021-12-30}}</ref>\n*The [[Kargil War]] (1999) began in May when Pakistan covertly sent troops to occupy strategic peaks in [[Kashmir]]. A month later, the [[Kargil War]] with India resulted in a political fiasco for Pakistani Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], followed by a Pakistani military withdrawal to the [[Line of Control]]. The incident led to a Pakistani [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état|military coup]] in October, in which Sharif was ousted by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Army Chief]] [[Pervez Musharraf]]. This conflict remains the only war fought between the two declared nuclear powers.\n\n*The [[Yugoslav Wars]] (1991–1995) followed the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], beginning on June 25, 1991, after the republics of [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] declared independence from [[Yugoslavia]]. These wars were notorious for war crimes and human rights violations, including [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]], with the overwhelming majority of casualties being Muslim [[Bosniaks]].\n**The [[Ten-Day War]] (1991) was a brief military conflict between Slovenian TO ([[Slovenian Territorial Defence]]) and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (\"JNA\") following [[Slovenia]]'s declaration of independence.\n**The [[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991–1995) was fought in modern-day [[Croatia]] between the Croatian government (having declared independence from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]) and both the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (\"JNA\") and [[Serbs of Croatia|Serb]] forces, who established the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (\"RSK\") within Croatia.\n**The [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995) involved several [[ethnicity|ethnically]]-defined factions within [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]: [[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs]], and [[Croats]], as well as [[Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia|a smaller Bosniak faction led by Fikret Abdić]]. The [[Siege of Sarajevo]] (1992–1995) marked the most violent [[urban warfare]] in Europe since [[World War II]] at that time, as [[Serbs|Serb]] forces bombarded and attacked Bosnian-controlled and populated areas of the city. War crimes occurred, including [[ethnic cleansing]] and the destruction of civilian property.\n**The final fighting in the Croatian and Bosnian wars ended in 1995 with the success of Croatian military offensives against Serb forces. This led to the mass exodus of [[Serbs]] from Croatia, Serb losses to Croat and Bosniak forces, and the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]], which internally partitioned Bosnia and Herzegovina into a [[Republika Srpska]] and a [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosniak-Croat Federation]].\n*The [[Kosovo War]] (1998–1999) was a war between Albanian separatists and Yugoslav military and Serb paramilitary forces in [[Kosovo]]. That conflict began in 1996 and escalated in 1998, with increasing reports of atrocities.\n**In 1999, the [[NATO]], led by the United States, launched [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|air attacks]] against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (then composed of only [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]) to pressure the Yugoslav government to end its military operations against Albanian separatists in [[Kosovo]]. The intervention lacked UN approval yet was justified by NATO based on accusations of war crimes committed by Yugoslav military forces working alongside nationalist Serb paramilitary groups. Finally, after months of bombing, Yugoslavia conceded to NATO's demands, and NATO forces (later UN peacekeeping forces) occupied Kosovo.\n*The [[South African Border War]] (1990) was a border war between [[Zambia]], [[Angola]], and [[Namibia]] that began in 1966 and ended in 1990.\n\n===Civil wars and guerrilla wars===\n[[File:Rwandan Genocide Murambi skulls.jpg|thumb|[[Rwandan genocide]]: Genocide victims in Murambi Technical School.

It included, as part of the perspective of the so-called \"Irish dimension,\" the [[principle of consent]] that the people of the island of Ireland had the exclusive right to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.<ref>\nPeatling, Gary (2004).

High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade during the [[Great Moderation]]. However, in the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]], GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed, and some [[capital flight]] occurred.\n*In 1993, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)]] was updated to include the creation of the [[World Trade Organization]], with the 76 existing GATT members and [[European Communities]] becoming the founding members of the World Trade Organization on 1 January 1995. Opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in [[Seattle]] in December 1999.\n**The [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] protests in the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in Seattle began on 30 November 1999. This marked the beginning of a steady increase in anti-globalization protests in the first decade of the 21st century and increasing hostility to [[neoliberalism]].\n*U.S. inflation moderated, beginning in 1990 at 5.39%, falling to a low of 1.55% in 1998 and rising slightly to 2.19% in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inflation in the 1990s|url=https://inflationdata.com/articles/inflation-in-the-1990s/|website=InflationData.com|access-date=28 December 2021}}</ref>\n*The [[G20]] or Group of Twenty formed on the 26 September 1999.\n\n'''North America'''\n[[File:President Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Mexican President Carlos Salinas participate in the... - NARA - 186460.jpg|thumb|US, Canadian, and Mexican dignitaries initialing the draft [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] in October 1992]]\n[[File:Dow jones.png|thumb|right|228px|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Index]] of the 1990s]]\n*The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United States and Canada, largely because of the unexpected advent of the Internet and the explosion of [[High tech|technology industries]]. The U.S. and Canadian economies experienced their longest period of peacetime economic expansion, beginning in 1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher productivity overall. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999 to 2001.\n*After the 1992 boom of the US [[stock market]], [[Alan Greenspan]] coined the phrase \"[[irrational exuberance]]\", a reference to the overenthusiam of investors that typified the trading of this period, and warned of [[overvaluation]] of assets and the stock market generally.\n*The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which phases out the trade barriers between the United States, Mexico, and Canada, was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]].\n\n'''Asia'''\n*In the [[China|People's Republic of China]], the government announced the major [[privatization]] of state-owned industries in September 1997. China entered the 1990s in a turbulent period due to the aftermath of both the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre|Tiananmen Square Massacre]] and [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline politicians]]' efforts to rein in [[Privately held company|private enterprise]] and attempt to revive old-fashioned [[propaganda]] campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of [[communism]] in Europe. In 1992 [[Deng Xiaoping]] [[Deng Xiaoping's southern tour|travelled]] to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize faith in [[Market economy|market economics]] and stop the country's slide back into [[Maoism]]. Afterward, China recovered and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade. Despite this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] launched a brutal crackdown against the [[Falun Gong]] [[Sect|religious sect]] in 1999. Deng Xiaoping died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|bombing of the Chinese embassy]] during the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|bombing of Serbia by NATO forces]], which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Facility.\n*[[1997 Asian financial crisis|Financial crisis]] hits [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n countries between 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic development, which continues into 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.\n*In [[Japan]], after three decades of [[Japanese economic miracle|economic growth]] put them in second place in the world's economies, the county experienced [[Lost Decades|an economic downturn]] after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, ending the seemingly unlimited prosperity that the country had previously enjoyed.\n*Less affluent nations such as [[India]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]] also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the continuation of terrorism in [[Third World]] regions that were once the \"frontlines\" for American and Soviet foreign politics, particularly in Asia.\n\n[[File:Bush Gorba P15623-25A.jpg|thumb|right|[[George H.

A [[Coup d'état|coup]] attempt by hardliners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence by 1991, and Gorbachev resigned from office on Christmas. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The new [[Russia|Russian Federation]] was headed by [[Boris Yeltsin]], and would face severe economic difficulty. [[Oligarchy|Oligarchs]] took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors, reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to [[Bribery|buy the support of]] the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the [[ruble]] continued, and with [[heart disease|heart]] and [[Alcoholism|alcohol troubles]], Yeltsin stepped down from office on the last day of 1999, handing power to [[Vladimir Putin]].\n*[[1998 Russian financial crisis|Russian financial crisis]] in the 1990s resulted in mass hyperinflation and prompted economic intervention from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and western countries to help Russia's economy recover.\n*The first [[McDonald's]] restaurant opened in [[Moscow]] in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and future Russian President Boris Yeltsin attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist [[free market]] economy and a move towards adopting elements of [[Western culture]].\n*[[Oil]] and [[Gasoline|gas]] were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and broader adoption of trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive [[Fossil fuel|fossil energy]], with low [[petroleum]] prices caused by increased oil production. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the [[Cold War]] led to economic development and higher living standards for many citizens.\n*Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the 1990s. However, problems including the massive [[1995 strikes in France|1995 general strikes in France]] following a recession and the difficulties associated with [[German reunification]] led to sluggish growth in these countries. However, the French and [[Germany|German]] economies improved in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the economies of Spain, [[Scandinavia]] and former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries accelerated at rapid speed during the decade. [[Unemployment|Unemployment rates]] were low due to many having experienced a deep [[recession]] at the start of the decade.\n*After the [[early 1990s recession]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Celtic Tiger|Ireland]] experienced rapid economic growth and falling unemployment that continued throughout the decade. Economic growth would continue until the [[Great Recession]], marking the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history.\n*Some [[Eastern Europe]]an economies struggled after the fall of communism, but [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] saw economic growth in the late 1990s.\n*With the creation of the [[European Union]] (EU), there is [[freedom of movement]] between member states, such as the [[European Union free trade agreements|1992 and 1995 free trade agreements]].\n**The [[Euro]] is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out the former national currencies of EU countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jsis.washington.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/05/the_euro.pdf|title=The Euro: Money Changes Everything|last1=Boschker|first1=Karen|last2=Sieberson|first2=Eric|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|date=2007|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''South America'''\n*A Latin American common market, [[Mercosur]], was established in 1991.

[[General Motors]] suffered huge losses because of an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] division fared well, [[Oldsmobile]] fell sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.\n\nCars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on.\n\n[[Chrysler]] ran into financial troubles as it entered the 1990s. Like GM, the Chrysler too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling [[Chrysler minivans|minivans]]) that were largely based on the aging [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]]. In 1992, chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]] and \"Cab-Forward\" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized [[Dodge Ram]] in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] (the parent company of [[Mercedes-Benz]]) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the [[Ford Taurus (second generation)|second]] and [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third]] generations of the [[Ford Taurus]] being named the best-selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the [[Toyota Camry]] starting in 1997, which became the best-selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, with the first model being sold in 1991. Ford's Explorer became the best-selling SUV on the market, outselling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee.\n\nJapanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The [[Honda Accord]] vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991 and outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the decade's second half. Many manufacturers that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Fabrication during the 1990s became gradually rounder and ovoid, the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|Ford Taurus]] and [[Mercury Sable]] being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as [[airbags]] and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars.\n\n===Science===\n[[File:Dollyscotland (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] is the first mammal to be [[cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]].]]\n[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n*Physicists develop [[M-theory]].\n*Detection of [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting [[star]]s other than the sun.\n*In the United Kingdom, the first [[cloning|cloned]] mammal, [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] was confirmed by the [[Roslin Institute]], and was reported by global media on 26 February 1997.

Female artists such as [[Reba McEntire]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Deana Carter]], [[LeAnn Rimes]] and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] all released platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. Rimes, a teenager at the time, spawned a \"teen movement\" in country music; with fellow teen artists [[Lila McCann]], [[Jessica Andrews]], [[Billy Gillman]], and others following suit; a feat that hasn't been duplicated since [[Tanya Tucker]] and [[Marie Osmond]] in the early 1970s. The [[Dixie Chicks]] became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s.

The National Organization for Women (NOW) claimed that the track was \"advocating violence against women\" due to the song's lyrics, which are themselves sampled from [[Ultramagnetic MCs]]s' Give the Drummer Some. The music video (directed by Jonas Åkerlund) featured a first-person POV of someone going clubbing, indulging in drugs and alcohol, getting into fist fights, abusing women and picking up a prostitute. At the end of the video, the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman.\n\n'''Deaths of artists'''\n\n[[Freddie Mercury]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Selena]],[[Eazy-E]], [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[the Notorious B.I.G.]] were the most publicized music-related deaths of the decade, in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 respectively. [[Richey Edwards]] of [[Manic Street Preachers]] was publicized in the media in 1991 following an incident involving [[Steve Lamacq]] backstage after a live show, in which Edwards carved '4 Real' into his arm.

In 1994, ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which originally starred [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]], [[Noah Wyle]] and [[George Clooney]], was a domestic and international success, lasting until 2009 and spawned similar series such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' (2005–present). It made [[NBC]] the most-watched channel in the United States. This show launched the career of [[George Clooney]]. That same year, ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', that starred [[Héctor Elizondo]], [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Adam Arkin]], was also a popular series for [[CBS]], lasting between 1994 and 2000.\n\nCrime drama and police detective shows returned to the spotlight after soap operas died down.

The show was then remade and renamed simply ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' and premiered in 2008. ''Beverly Hills, 90210'', and its spin-off ''[[Melrose Place]]'' also became a popular TV show throughout the 1990s. ''[[Baywatch]]'' became the most-watched TV show in history {{citation needed|date=December 2022}} and influenced pop culture.\n\n''[[Sex and the City]]''{{'s}} portrayal of relationships and sexuality caused controversy and acclaim, leading to a new generation of sexually progressive television shows in the 2000s.\n\n'''Other television shows and genres'''\n\nFantasy and science fiction shows were popular on television, with NBC airing ''[[SeaQuest DSV]]'' beginning in 1993, which made [[Jonathan Brandis]] a popular [[teen idol]], but was cancelled after three seasons. The 1990s saw a multitude of ''[[Star Trek]]'' content: in 1993, following the success of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', Paramount released the follow-up shows ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (1993–1999) and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' (1995–2001). ''[[Touched By an Angel]]'', broadcast by CBS in 1994, was intended as the comeback vehicle of [[Della Reese]], and also launched the career of [[Roma Downey]]. It wasn't an immediate success and was cancelled, but was revived the following year due to a fan letter-writing campaign, and ran for eight more seasons. At the end of the decade, the [[fantasy drama]] series [[Charmed]] gained a [[cult following]] and helped popularize [[the WB]].\n\nIn 1993, one of the last [[western (genre)|westerns]] to air on television was ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'', a [[crime drama]] starring [[Chuck Norris]] as the title character. Running for nine seasons, the show tackled a wide variety of subjects and was one of few shows to feature an actor performing karate stunts at that time.\n\n[[Reality television]] was not an entirely new concept (''[[An American Family]]'' aired on [[PBS]] in 1973) but proliferated for [[Generation X]] audiences with titles such as ''[[Judge Judy]]'', ''[[Eco-Challenge]],'' and ''[[Cops (TV program)|Cops]]''.\n\nThe 1990s saw the debut of live-action children's programs such as the educational ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' and ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' as well as the superhero show ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'', the latter becoming a pop culture phenomenon along with a line of action figures and other toys by Japanese toy manufacturer [[Bandai]]. This can also be said for the British pre-school series ''[[Teletubbies]]'', which was a massive hit loved by very young children. It also saw long time running shows such as ''[[Barney & Friends]]'' and the continuation of ''[[Sesame Street|Seasme Street]]'', both of which would continue in the following decades and so.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, two of the biggest professional wrestling companies: ''[[World Championship Wrestling]]'' and ''[[World Wrestling Federation]]'' were in a ratings battle that was called the [[Monday Night Wars]] (1995–2001). Each company fought to draw more viewers to their respective Monday night wrestling show. The \"War\" ended in 2001 when ''[[WWE]]'' bought ''[[WCW]]''. In November 2001, there was a Winner Takes All match with both companies in a Pay-Per-View called ''[[Survivor Series]]''. WWF won the match, putting an end to WCW.\n\nThe late 1990s also saw the evolution of a new TV genre: primetime game shows, popularized by the game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', hosted originally by [[Chris Tarrant]] on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Regis Philbin]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], as well as other first-run game shows aired in prime time on the newly launched [[Game Show Network]].\n\n'''Animated shows'''\n\nAn animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in December 1989 and became a domestic and international success in the 1990s. The show has since aired more than 600 episodes and has become an institution of pop culture. In addition, it has spawned the adult-oriented [[animated sitcom]] genre, inspiring more adult-oriented animated shows such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' (1993–1997), ''[[Daria]]'' (1997–2001), along with ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', the latter two of which began in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and continue to air new episodes through the 2000s and into the 2020s.\n\nCartoons produced in the 1990s are sometimes referred to as the \"Renaissance Age of Animation\" for cartoons in general, particularly for American animated children's programs. [[Disney Channel]], [[Nickelodeon]] (owned by Viacom, now Paramount Global) and [[Cartoon Network]] (owned by Warner Bros. Discovery) would dominate the animated television industry. These three channels are considered the \"Big Three\", of children's entertainment, even today, but especially during the 1990s.\n\nOther channels such as [[Warner Bros. Animation]] would create shows like ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and the start of the [[DC Animated Universe]] with shows such as ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', as well as syndicated shows like ''[[Phantom 2040]]''. Nickelodeon's first three animated series (''[[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]'', ''[[Rugrats]]'', ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'') all premiered in 1991 along with shows such as [[Hey Arnold!]], [[CatDog]], [[Rocket Power]], and in 1999 saw the debut of Nickelodeon's well known animated comedy series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. Cartoon Network would create shows like ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]], [[The Powerpuff Girls]], [[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]],'' and ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]''. Disney Channel would made shows like ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers (TV series)|Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers]],'' ''[[Darkwing Duck]], [[Adventures of the Gummi Bears]], and [[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]].''\n\nJapanese [[anime]] was popular in the 1980s and expanded to a worldwide audience by the 1990s for its expansive spectrum of story subjects and themes not limited to comedy and superhero action found in the US. It featured well-produced, well-written, visual, and story content that came to showcase animation's potential for emotional and intellectual depth and integrity on par with live action media to its viewers. Anime expanded to older and adult audiences in the medium of [[animation]]. Anime shows such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Digimon]]'', ''[[Pokémon (TV series)|Pokémon]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'', ''[[Detective Conan]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''[[Ranma ½]]'', ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'', ''[[Slayers]]'', ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'', ''[[Initial D]]'', ''[[Gunsmith Cats]]'', ''[[Outlaw Star]]'', to anime movies such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]'', ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'', ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'', ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', and imports by various distributors such as [[Viz Media|Viz]], [[AnimEigo]], [[Central Park Media]], [[A.D.

Also popular among children were light-up sneakers, [[jelly shoes]], and shoelace hair clips.\n*The [[Grunge]] hype at the beginning of the decade popularized [[flannel]] shirts among both genders during the 1990s.\n*[[Heroin chic]] appeared sporadically across film, fashion models and grunge music, but gave way by end of the US recession and the emergence of internet \"geek\" culture (a sassy tech-literate style centered on web searching and drinking coffee).  \n*Grunge- and [[hip-hop]]-inspired anti-fashion saw an expansion of the slouchy, casual styles of past decades, mostly seen in baggy and distressed jeans, cargo shorts and pants, baseball caps (often worn backward), chunky sneakers, oversized sweatshirts, and loose-fitting tees with [[Grandiloquence|grandiloquent]] [[graphics]] and [[logos]].\n*[[2000s in fashion|Svelte fashion]] was also popular from the beginning of the 1990s and into the 2000s, as the new millennium began. The rivalry of sloppy grunge fashion versus more expensive clothing made for fitter bodies was a repeat of the rock versus disco rivalry of a decade ago. Nineties fashion became darker, slinkier, and more [[Science fiction|futuristic-looking]] clothing in the late 1990s, with Keanu Reeves in The Matrix as a style icon.\n*[[Tattoo]]s and [[Body piercing|piercings]] became part of the [[wikt:mainstream|mainstream]] aesthetic. American model [[Christy Turlington]] revealed her [[Navel piercing|belly button piercing]] at a fashion show in London in 1993.

Although [[First-person shooter|FPS games]] had long since seen the transition to full 3D, other genres began to copy this trend by the end of the decade. The most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]''.\n\nThe violent nature of fighting games like [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', [[Sega]]'s ''[[Virtua Fighter (arcade game)|Virtua Fighter]]'', and [[Midway Games|Midway]]'s ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' prompted the video game industry to accept a [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|game rating system]]. Hundreds of knockoffs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) bursts onto the world scene, and instantly popularizes the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] genre. ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998) builds upon this, using gameplay without [[Level (video games)|levels]] and an immersive [[First-person narrative|first-person perspective]]. Half-Life became one of the most popular FPS games in history.\n\nThe [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) genre is introduced in 1992 with the release of ''[[Dune II]]''. ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'' (1994) popularizing the genre, and ''[[Command & Conquer]]'' and ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]'' in 1995, setting up the first major real-time strategy competition and popularizing multiplayer capabilities in RTS games. ''[[StarCraft]]'' in 1998 becomes the second best-selling computer game of all time. It remains among the most popular multiplayer RTS games today, especially in [[South Korea]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2022}} ''[[Homeworld]]'' in 1999 becomes the first successful 3D RTS game. The rise of the RTS genre is often credited with the fall of the [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) genre, popularized with ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' in 1991. ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' was introduced (in North America) in 1990 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and remains among the most popular video game [[Final Fantasy|franchises]], with many new titles to date and more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles. ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', released in 1997, especially popularized the series.\n\n[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs) see their entrance with ''[[Ultima Online]]'' in 1997. However, they do not gain widespread popularity until ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in 1999.

He was also notable outside of basketball thanks to his self-portrayal in the film ''[[Space Jam]]'' with the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters.\n*The [[National Hockey League]] would expand from 21 to 30 teams. During the expansion years, several teams would relocate to new cities: the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972-96)|Winnipeg Jets]] moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and became the [[Phoenix Coyotes]], the [[Quebec Nordiques]] moved to [[Denver]] and became the [[Colorado Avalanche]], the [[Hartford Whalers]] moved to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] and became the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], and the [[Minnesota North Stars]] moved to [[Dallas]] and became the [[Dallas Stars]].\n**The NHL's 1990s expansion saw new teams in cities that previously never had NHL hockey: [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] ([[San Jose Sharks]]), [[Anaheim]] ([[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]]), [[Nashville]] ([[Nashville Predators]]), Miami ([[Florida Panthers]]), and [[Tampa]] ([[Tampa Bay Lightning]]).

Afterwards, a second boom period from the middle of the decade was initiated due to the [[Monday Night Wars]] between the WWF and [[WCW]] to later spawn the WWF's [[Attitude Era]], home to some of the biggest names in wrestling history such as [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], and [[Triple H]]. Meanwhile, the highly popular [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] stable, along with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], brought WCW major success.\n*The [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won an unprecedented [[treble (association football)|treble]] of the [[Premier League]], [[FA Cup]] and [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League]] after defeating [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 2–1 in May 1999.\n*The United States hosted the 15th staging of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].

As economic deconstruction increased in the developed world, multiple [[multinational corporations]] associated with the manufacturing industry relocated into [[Thailand]], [[Mexico]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and [[China]]. [[Japan]] and [[West Germany]] saw large economic growth during this decade. The [[AIDS epidemic]] became recognized in the 1980s and has since killed an estimated 39 million people ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aids.gov/federal-resources/around-the-world/global-aids-overview/|title=Global HIV/AIDS Overview|work=aids.gov|access-date=16 April 2016}}</ref> [[Global warming]] became well known to the scientific and political community in the 1980s.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] moved closer to [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic policies]], beginning a trend towards global instability of international trade that would pick up more steam in the [[1990s|following decade]] as the fall of the USSR made [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] economic policy more powerful.\n\nThe final decade of the Cold War opened with the US-Soviet confrontation continuing largely without any interruption. Superpower tensions escalated rapidly as President Reagan scrapped the policy of détente and adopted a new, much more aggressive stance on the Soviet Union. The world came perilously close to nuclear war for the first time since the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962, but the second half of the decade saw a dramatic easing of superpower tensions and ultimately the total collapse of Soviet communism.\n\nDeveloping countries across the world faced economic and social difficulties as they suffered from multiple debt crises in the 1980s, requiring many of these countries to apply for financial assistance from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]]. [[Ethiopia]] witnessed [[1984–1985 famine in Ethiopia|widespread famine in the mid-1980s]] during the corrupt rule of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], resulting in the country having to depend on foreign aid to provide food to its population and worldwide efforts to address and raise money to help Ethiopians, such as the [[Live Aid]] concert in 1985.\n\nMajor civil discontent and violence occurred, including the [[Angolan Civil War]], the [[Ethiopian Civil War]], the [[Moro conflict]], the [[Ugandan Bush War]], the [[insurgency in Laos]], the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], the [[1982 Lebanon War]], the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], the [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency]], and the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. [[Islamism]] became a powerful political force in the 1980s and many [[jihadist]] organizations, including [[Al Qaeda]], were set up.\n\nBy 1986, nationalism was making a comeback in the Eastern Bloc, and the desire for democracy in [[socialist state]]s, combined with economic recession, resulted in [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]], which reduced Communist Party power, legalized dissent and sanctioned limited forms of capitalism such as [[joint venture]]s with companies from [[capitalist]] countries. After tension for most of the decade, by 1988 relations between the communist and capitalist blocs had improved significantly<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Flora|title=FOREIGN AFFAIRS; Cold War Recedes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/29/opinion/foreign-affairs-cold-war-recedes.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 29, 1988}}</ref> and the Soviet Union was increasingly unwilling to defend its governments in satellite states.\n\n1989 brought the overthrow and attempted overthrow of a number of governments led by communist parties, such as in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] in China, the [[Velvet Revolution|Czechoslovak \"Velvet Revolution\"]], [[Erich Honecker]]'s East German regime, Poland's Soviet-backed government, and [[Romanian Revolution|the violent overthrow]] of the [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] regime in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]. Destruction of the 155-km [[Berlin Wall]], at the end of the decade, signaled a seismic geopolitical shift. The [[Cold War]] ended in the early 1990s with the successful [[Reunification of Germany]] and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR's demise]] after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August Coup]] of 1991.\n\nThe 1980s was an era of tremendous population growth around the world, surpassing the 1970s and 1990s, and arguably being the largest in human history. During the 1980s, the world population grew from 4.4 to 5.3 billion people. There were approximately 1.33 billion births and 480 million deaths. Population growth was particularly rapid in a number of African, Middle Eastern, and [[South Asia]]n countries during this decade, with rates of natural increase close to or exceeding 4% annually. The 1980s saw the advent of the ongoing practice of [[sex-selective abortion]] in China and India as [[ultrasound]] technology permitted parents to selectively abort baby girls.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/about/journals/ipsrh/2011/09/sex-selective-abortions-during-past-three-decades-may-explain-absence|title=Sex-Selective Abortions During Past Three Decades May Explain Absence of Millions of Girls in India|date=29 September 2011 |journal=International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|volume=37 |pages=162–163 |last1=Melhado |first1=Lisa }}</ref>\n\nThe 1980s saw great advances in genetic and digital technology.

The [[video game crash of 1983]] ended the system's popularity and decimated the industry until the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] re-established the console market in North America. The hand-held [[Game Boy]] launched in 1989. ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Tetris]]'' were the decade's best selling games. ''[[Pac-Man]]'' was the highest grossing arcade game. [[Home computers]] became commonplace. The 1981 [[IBM PC]] led to a large market for [[IBM PC compatible]]s. The 1984 release of the [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] popularized the [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]] style of interaction.\n\n==Politics and wars==\n{{See also|List of sovereign states in the 1980s}}\n[[File:Sesel map of socialist states.PNG|thumb|Cold War Map of Communist & Socialist countries in 1985]]\n\n===Wars===\n{{Main|List of wars 1945–89#1980–1989}}\nThe most prominent [[armed conflict]]s of the decade include:\n\n====International wars====\n[[File:US Army Rangers parachute into Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury.jpg|thumb|right|[[Invasion of Grenada]], October 1983]]\nThe most notable wars of the decade include:\n* The [[Cold War]] (1947–1991)\n** [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (1979–1989) – a war fought between the [[Soviet Union]] and the Islamist Mujahideen Resistance in Afghanistan. The mujahideen found other support from a variety of sources including the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] of the [[United States]] (see [[Operation Cyclone]]), as well as [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Pakistan]] and other Muslim nations through the context of the Cold War and the regional India–Pakistan conflict.\n** [[Invasion of Grenada]] (1983) – a 1983 U.S.-led invasion of [[Grenada]], triggered by a [[military coup]] which ousted a brief [[revolution]]ary government. The successful invasion led to a change of government but was controversial due to charges of [[American imperialism]], [[Cold War]] politics, the involvement of [[Cuba]], the unstable state of the Grenadian government, and Grenada's status as a [[Commonwealth realm]].\n** [[Salvadoran Civil War]] (1980–1992) – part of the cold war conflicts, reached its peak in the 1980s, 70,000 Salvadorans died.\n* Argentina invaded the [[Falkland Islands]], sparking the [[Falklands War]]. It occurred from April 2 to July 14, 1982, between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Argentina]] as British forces fought to recover the islands. Britain emerged victorious and its stance in international affairs and its long-decaying reputation as a [[Colonialism|colonial power]] received an unexpected boost. The [[military junta]] of Argentina, on the other hand, was left humiliated by the defeat; and its leader [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] was deposed three days after the end of the war. A military investigation known as the Rattenbach Report even recommended his execution.\n* [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] (early 20th century – present)\n** [[1982 Lebanon War]] – the [[Politics of Israel|Government of Israel]] ordered the invasion as a response to the assassination attempt against Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, [[Shlomo Argov]], by the [[Abu Nidal Organization]] and due to the constant terror attacks on northern Israel made by the terrorist organizations which resided in Lebanon. After attacking the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]], as well as [[Syria]]n, leftist and [[Muslim]] [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] forces, Israel occupied southern Lebanon and eventually surrounded the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] in west [[Beirut]] and subjected to heavy bombardment, they negotiated passage from Lebanon.\n** In October 1985 eight Israeli [[F-15 Eagles]] carried out [[Operation Wooden Leg]] intending to bomb the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]]'s new headquarters in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], more than 2,000&nbsp;km from Israel. The attack cost 270 lives, most of them Tunisian civilians. The attack was later condemned by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The United States is thought to have assisted or known of the attack.\n* The [[Iran–Iraq War]] took place from 1980 to 1988. [[Iraq]] was accused of using illegal [[chemical weapons]] to kill [[Iran]]ian forces and against its own dissident [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] populations. Both sides suffered enormous casualties, but the poorly equipped Iranian armies suffered worse for it, being forced to use soldiers as young as 15 in human-wave attacks. Iran finally agreed to an armistice in 1988.\n* The United States launched an [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|aerial bombardment of Libya]] in 1986 in retaliation for Libyan support of terrorism and attacks on US personnel in [[Germany]] and [[Turkey]].\n* The [[South African Border War]] between South Africa and the alliance of [[Angola]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zambia]] ended in 1989, ending over thirty years of conflict.\n* The United States engaged in significant direct and indirect conflict in the decade via alliances with various groups in a number of Central and South American countries claiming that the U.S. was acting to oppose the spread of [[communism]] and end illicit drug trade. The U.S. government supported the government of [[Colombia]]'s attempts to destroy its large illicit [[cocaine]]-trafficking industry and provided support for right-wing military government in the [[Salvadoran civil war]] which became controversial after the [[El Mozote massacre]] on December 11, 1981, in which U.S.-trained Salvadoran paramilitaries killed 1000 Salvadoran civilians. The United States, along with members of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]], [[Invasion of Grenada|invaded]] [[Grenada]] in 1983. The [[Iran–Contra affair]] erupted which involved U.S. interventionism in [[Nicaragua]], resulting in members of the U.S. government being indicted in 1986. U.S. military action began against [[Panama]] in December 1989 to overthrow its dictator, [[Manuel Noriega]] resulting in 3,500 civilian casualties and the restoration of democratic rule.\n* [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]] took place as part of the [[Angolan civil war]] and [[South African Border War]] from 1987 to 1988. The battle involved the largest fighting in Africa since World War II between military forces from [[Angola]], [[Cuba]] (expeditionary forces) and [[Namibia]] versus military forces from South Africa and the dissident Angolan [[UNITA]] organization.\n* The [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]] between [[Azerbaijan]] and the [[Armenia]] started in 1988 and ended in 1994.\n* The [[United States invasion of Panama]] in December 1989 led to the deposition of [[Manuel Noriega]].\n\n====Civil wars and guerrilla wars====\nThe most notable internal conflicts of the decade include:\n* The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] occurred in the People's Republic of China in 1989, in which pro-democracy protesters demanded political reform. The protests were crushed by the People's Liberation Army.\n* The [[First Intifada]] (First Uprising) in the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]] began in 1987 when Palestinian Arabs mounted large-scale protests against the Israeli military presence in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, largely inhabited by Palestinians. The First Intifada would continue until peace negotiations began between the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and the Israeli government in 1993.\n* [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–1990) – Throughout the decade, Lebanon was engulfed in civil war between Islamic and Christian factions.\n* The [[Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front]] began a violent campaign for independence in [[New Caledonia]].\n* [[Greenpeace]]'s attempts to monitor [[French nuclear testing]] on [[Mururoa]] were halted by the [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|sinking]] of the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|Rainbow Warrior]]''.\n* The [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] erupts in 1983 between the [[Muslim]] government of [[Sudan]] in the north and non-Muslim rebel secessionists in [[South Sudan|Southern Sudan]]. The conflict continues through the present day [[Darfur genocide]].\n* [[Internal conflict in Peru]]: The communist [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] starts its fight against the Peruvian state in 1980, that would continue until the end of the 1990s.\n* [[Haiti]]an [[dictator]] [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] was overthrown by a popular [[Anti-Duvalier protest movement|uprising]] on February 6, 1986.\n* [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] continued.\n* [[Ethiopian Civil War]] (1974–1991)\n* [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002)\n* [[Ugandan Bush War]] (1980–1986)\n* [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] (1983–2009)\n\n===Terrorist attacks===\n{{Main|List of terrorist incidents#1970–present}}\n[[File:Beirutbarr.jpg|thumb|right|[[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]]]]\n\nThe most notable terrorist attacks of the decade include:\n* [[Bologna massacre]] in [[Italy]] on August 2, 1980, three members of the [[neo-fascist]] group [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]] detonate a time bomb at [[Bologna Central Station]], killing 85 people.\n* [[El Mozote massacre]] in [[El Salvador]] on December 11, 1981, against civilians, committed by government forces supported by the [[United States]] during their anti-guerrilla campaign against Marxist–Leninist rebels.\n* The [[Rome and Vienna airport attacks]] took place on December 27, 1985, against the Israeli [[El Al]] airline. The attack was done by militants loyal to [[Abu Nidal]], backed by the government of [[Libya]].\n* The [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] – during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] two [[truck bomb]]s struck separate buildings housing United States and French military forces killing 299 American and French servicemen. The organization [[Islamic Jihad Organization|Islamic Jihad]] claimed responsibility for the bombing.\n* [[Air India Flight 182]] was destroyed on June 23, 1985, by Sikh-Canadian militants. It was the biggest mass murder involving Canadians in Canada's history.\n* On December 21, 1988, [[Pan Am Flight 103]] was blown up over the village of Lockerbie, Scotland, while en route from London's Heathrow Airport to New York's JFK. The bombing killed all 259 people on board, 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground, totaling 270 fatalities who were citizens of 21 nationalities. The bombing was and remains the worst terrorist attack on [[UK]] soil.\n\n===Coups===\n{{Main|List of coups d'état and coup attempts#1980 - 1989}}\nThe most prominent [[coups d'état]] of the decade include:\n* A [[1980 Surinamese coup d'état|military coup]] is launched in [[Suriname]] on February 25, 1980; the country's politics are dominated by the military until 1991.\n* [[Nigeria]] suffered multiple [[military coup]]s in 1983 and 1985.\n* [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] staged two [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|military coups in Fiji]] in 1987, and declared the country a [[republic]] the same year.\n* The \"[[Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution]]\" – a series of interconnected coups d'états – take place in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from 1988 to 1989 through mass protests organized and committed by supporters of Serbian politician [[Slobodan Milošević]] overthrow the governments of Serbia's autonomous provinces of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], and the government of [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]], and finally the main government of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]] with Milošević becoming [[President of Serbia]].\n\n===Nuclear threats===\n[[File:IAF F-16A Netz 243 CIAF 2004.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Israeli Air Force]] [[F-16A]] Netz '243' that was flown by Colonel [[Ilan Ramon]] during [[Operation Opera]] ]]\n* [[Operation Opera]] – a 1981 surprise [[Israel]]i [[air strike]] that destroyed the [[Iraq]]i [[nuclear reactor]] being constructed near [[Baghdad]]. Israeli [[military intelligence]] assumed this was for the purpose of [[plutonium]] production to further an Iraqi [[nuclear weapons]] program. Israeli intelligence also believed that the summer of 1981 would be the last chance to destroy the reactor before it would be loaded with [[nuclear fuel]].\n* US President Reagan's decision to station intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe provoked mass protests involving more than one million people.\n\n===Decolonization and independence===\n* Following the decolonization and independence of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth realms]].\n** In 1982, Canada gained official independence from the United Kingdom with the [[Canada Act 1982]], authorized by the signature by [[Elizabeth II]]. This act severed all political dependencies of the United Kingdom in Canada (although the Queen remained the head of state).\n** In 1986, Australia gained full independence from the United Kingdom with the [[Australia Act 1986]], which severed the last remaining powers of the British government over the Australian government, including the removal of the privy council as the highest court of appeal. Australia retained the queen as head of state.\n** In 1986, New Zealand and the United Kingdom fully separated New Zealand's governments from the influence of the British Parliament, resulting in New Zealand's full independence with the [[Constitution Act 1986]] which also reorganized the [[New Zealand Government|New Zealand government]].\n** Independence was granted to [[Vanuatu]] from the British/French condominium (1980), [[Kiribati]] from joint US-British government (1981) and [[Palau]] from the United States (1986).\n** [[Zimbabwe]] becomes independent from official colonial rule of the United Kingdom in 1980.\n** Independence was given to [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Belize]] (both 1981), and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] (1983) in the Caribbean; [[Brunei]] (1984) and [[Thailand]] formed a US-British government (1981) in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Prominent political events===\n\n====Americas====\n[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev signing.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev signing the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]], 1987]]\n* [[Ronald Reagan]] was elected U.S. president in 1980. In international affairs, Reagan pursued a hardline policy towards preventing the spread of communism, initiating a considerable buildup of U.S. military power to challenge the Soviet Union. He further directly challenged the [[Iron Curtain]] by demanding that the Soviet Union dismantle the [[Berlin Wall]].\n* The [[Reagan Administration]] accelerated the [[War on Drugs]], publicized through anti-drug campaigns including the [[Just Say No]] campaign of First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]]. Drugs gained attention in the US as a serious problem in the '80s. Cocaine was relatively popular among celebrities and affluent youth, while crack, a cheaper offshoot of the drug, was linked to high crime rates in inner cities during the [[American crack epidemic]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* The [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)]] (PATCO) declared a strike on August 3, 1981, seeking better working conditions, better pay, and a 32-hour workweek. The strike caused considerable disruption of the U.S. air transportation system. Resolution came when [[Ronald Reagan]] fired over 11,000 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored the order, banning them from federal service for life. After seeking appeals, many of the controllers were re-hired while the FAA attempted to replace much of their air traffic control staffing. The remainder continued to be banned until President Clinton lifted the final aspects in 1993. \n* Political unrest in the province of [[Quebec]], which, due to the many differences between the dominant francophone population and the anglophone minority, and also to francophone rights in the predominantly [[Canadian English|English]]-speaking Canada, came to a head in 1980 when the provincial government called a public [[1980 Quebec referendum|referendum]] on partial separation from the rest of Canada. The referendum ended with the \"no\" side winning majority (59.56% no, 40.44% yes).\n* [[Military dictatorship]]s give way to democracy in [[History of Argentina#New democracy (1983–present)|Argentina]] (1983), [[History of Uruguay#20th century|Uruguay]] (1984–85), [[1980s in Brazil|Brazil]] (1985–1988) and [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|Chile]] (1988–89). This marked the end of the [[Operation Condor]] for 30 years.\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked the beginning of German reunification]]\n[[File:UKK-hautajaissaattue.jpg|thumb|150px|Former [[president of Finland]] from 1956 to 1982.

At the end of his presidency the [[Mani pulite]] corruption scandal broke up, causing the collapse of the political system.\n* Significant political reforms occurred in a number of communist countries in eastern Europe as the populations of these countries grew increasingly hostile and politically active in opposing communist governments. These reforms included attempts to increase individual liberties and market liberalization, and promises of democratic renewal. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe was generally peaceful, the exception being [[Romanian Revolution|Romania]], whose leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] tried to keep the people isolated from the events happening outside the country. While making a speech in Bucharest in December 1989, he was booed and shouted down by the crowd, and then tried to flee the city with his wife [[Elena Ceaușescu|Elena]]. Two days later, they were captured, charged with genocide, and shot on Christmas Day.\n* In [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], following the death of communist leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] in May 1980, the trend of political reform of the communist system occurred along with a trend towards [[ethnic nationalism]] and inter-ethnic hostility, especially in Serbia, beginning with the 1986 [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] followed by the agenda of Serbian communist leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] who aggressively pushed for increased political influence of Serbs in the late 1980s, condemning non-Serb Yugoslav politicians who challenged his agenda as being enemies of Serbs.\n* There was continuing civil strife in Northern Ireland, including the adoption of hunger strikes by Irish Republican Army prisoners seeking the reintroduction of political status.\n* [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, and initiated major reforms to the Soviet Union's government through increasing the rights of expressing political dissent and opening elections to opposition candidates (while maintaining legal dominance of the Communist Party). Gorbachev pursued negotiation with the United States to decrease tensions and eventually end the [[Cold War]].\n* During the [[Revolutions of 1989]], most of the communist governments in Eastern Europe collapsed. The [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 would be followed in 1990 by the [[German reunification]]. \n* The United Kingdom was governed by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], the first female leader of a Western country. Under her [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Premiership]], the party introduced widespread economic reforms including the [[privatisation]] of industries and the de-regulation of [[stock market]]s echoing similar reforms of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. She was also a staunch opponent of communism, earning her the nickname ''The Iron Lady''.\n* Poor industrial relations marked the beginning of the decade; the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)]] was a major [[industrial action]] affecting the [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|UK coal industry]]. The strike by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM) was led by [[Arthur Scargill]], although some NUM members considered it to be unconstitutional and did not observe it. The [[BBC]] has referred to the strike as \"the most bitter industrial dispute in British history.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=1984: The beginning of the end for British coal |location=London |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/12/newsid_3503000/3503346.stm|access-date=20 December 2014}}</ref> At its height, the strike involved 142,000 mineworkers, making it the biggest since the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]].<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strikes Around the World, 1968–2005: Case-studies of 15 Countries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ2ms23ZuVQC|location=Amsterdam |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |page=353 |date=2007 |isbn=978-90-5260-285-1}}</ref>\n* In November 1982, [[Leonid Brezhnev]], who had led the Soviet Union since 1964, died. He was followed in quick succession by [[Yuri Andropov]], the former KGB chief, and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], both of whom were in poor health during their short tenures in office.\n\n====Asia====\n* Following the [[assassination of Park Chung-hee]], South Korean president [[Chun Doo Hwan]] came to power at the end of 1979 and ruled as a dictator until his presidential term expired in 1987. He was responsible for the [[Gwangju Uprising]] in May 1980 when police and soldiers battled armed protesters. Relations with North Korea showed little sign of improvement during the 1980s. In 1983, when Chun was in Burma, [[Rangoon bombing|a bomb apparently planted by North Korean agents]] killed a number of South Korean government officials. After leaving office, he was succeeded by [[Roh Tae Woo]], the first democratic ruler of the country, which saw its international prestige greatly rise with hosting the Olympics in 1988. Roh pursued a policy of normalizing relations with China and the Soviet Union, but had to face militant left-wing student groups who demanded reunification with North Korea and the withdrawal of US troops.\n* In the Philippines, after almost 20 years of dictatorship, Philippine president [[Ferdinand Marcos]] left the presidency and was replaced by [[Corazon Aquino]] through the \"[[People Power Revolution]]\" from February 22 to 25, 1986. This has been considered by some a peaceful revolution despite the fact that the Armed Forces of the Philippines issued an order to disperse the crowds on [[EDSA]] (the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila).\n* Democratization in South Korea and Taiwan, having lasted 42 and 27 years under the authoritarian regime since the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]] (including the lifting of [[martial law in Taiwan]] and the [[1987 South Korean presidential election|first direct presidential elections]] in South Korea).\n* The [[1988 Summer Olympics]] were held in South Korea, the first time the country hosted them.\n\n==Assassinations and attempts==\n[[File:Official Portrait of President Reagan 1981.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Ronald Reagan]]]]\n[[File:Anwar as-Sadat.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Anwar Sadat]]]]\nProminent assassinations, targeted killings, and assassination attempts include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:120px;\"| Date\n!

Sixty-five people were killed and thousands injured, with major structural damage on freeways and buildings and broken gas-line fires in [[San Francisco]], California. The cost of the damage totaled $13 billion (1989 [[United States dollar|USD]]).\n* The [[1988–89 North American drought]] decimated the US with many parts of the country affected. This was the worst drought to hit the United States in many years. The drought caused $60 billion in damage (between $80 billion and $120 billion for 2008 [[United States dollar|USD]]). The concurrent [[heat wave]]s killed 5,800 to 17,000 people in the United States.\n* [[Hurricane Allen]] (1980), [[Hurricane Alicia]] (1983), [[Hurricane Gilbert]] (1988), [[Hurricane Joan–Miriam|Hurricane Joan]] (1988), and [[Hurricane Hugo]] (1989) were some notably destructive Atlantic hurricanes of the 1980s.\n* Other natural disasters of the 1980s include the 1982–1983 [[1982–83 El Niño event|El Niño]] which brought destructive weather to most of the world; the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], which registered 8.0 on the [[moment magnitude scale]] and devastated Mexico City and other areas throughout central Mexico; the 1985 [[Nevado del Ruiz]] [[lahar]] in [[Colombia]]; the 1986 [[Lake Nyos]] [[limnic eruption]] in [[Cameroon]]; and the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]], which rocked the [[Caucasus]] region of the [[USSR]].\n\n===Non-natural disasters===\n[[File:Challenger explosion.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Space Shuttle Challenger|space shuttle ''Challenger'']] disintegrates on January 28, 1986]]\n\n* On April 25, 1980, [[Dan-Air Flight 1008]] crashed on approach to [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]].

This was the first disaster involving the destruction of a NASA space shuttle. A faulty [[O-ring]] was the cause of the accident.\n*On February 8, 1986 near Hinton, Alberta, Canada (west of Edmonton) a westbound Canadian National (CN Rail) freight train slammed head-on into an oncoming eastbound VIA Rail passenger train, resulting in twenty-six casualties & dozens of serious injuries. A judicial inquiry that followed concluded that the freight train crew failed to obey signals (which were working properly) & ran through the switch off a siding, back into the single main track. It was also noted that the crew of the freight train were possibly asleep on duty.   \n* On April 26, 1986, the [[Chernobyl disaster]], a large-scale [[nuclear meltdown]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]], spread a large amount of radioactive material across Europe, killing 47 people, dooming countless others to future radiation-related cancer, and causing the displacement of 300,000 people.\n* On June 14, 1986, [[Fantasyland (West Edmonton Mall)|Fantasyland's]] [[Mindbender (Galaxyland)|Mindbender]] inside [[West Edmonton Mall]], derails and kills 3 people, injuring one, and slams into a concrete post.\n* On August 31, 1986, [[1986 Cerritos mid-air collision|Aeroméxico Flight 498]] crashed after colliding with a private [[Piper Cherokee]] over [[Cerritos, California]], killing everyone on both airplanes and several others on the ground.

All 159 aboard were killed.\n* On December 7, 1987, 43 people were killed when an irate former [[US Airways|USAir]] employee went on a rampage aboard [[Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771|PSA Flight 1771]].\n* On December 20, 1987, the [[Philippines|Philippine]] passenger ferry [[MV Doña Paz|MV ''Doña Paz'']] burned and sank after colliding with the oil tanker [[MT Vector|MT ''Vector'']]. With an estimated death toll of over 4,000, this was and remains the world's deadliest peacetime maritime disaster.\n* On July 3, 1988, [[Iran Air Flight 655]] was shot down by the U.S. missile cruiser [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)|USS ''Vincennes'']] over the [[Strait of Hormuz]], killing all 290 people on the plane. The event is one of the most controversial aviation occurrences of all time, with the true cause disputed between the Americans and the Iranians.\n* On December 21, 1988, an American passenger 747 airliner en route from Frankfurt to Detroit (via London and New York) [[Pan Am Flight 103]] was destroyed by a bomb while it was flying over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing the 259 passengers and crew members on board and 11 people on the ground. This was the worst terrorist attack to have occurred on British soil. \n* On March 24, 1989, the [[oil tanker]] [[Exxon Valdez]] ran aground on [[Bligh Reef]] in [[Alaska]]'s [[Prince William Sound]] spilling an estimated equivalent of 260,000 to 750,000 barrels of crude oil. Although not among the largest oil spills in history, its remote and sensitive location made it one of the most devastating ecological disasters ever. The after effects of the spill continue to be felt to this day.\n* On April 15, 1989, The [[Hillsborough disaster]] occurs during a [[FA Cup]] Semi-Final in [[Sheffield]], England fatally crushing 96 football fans and injuring nearly 1,000 more.\n* On July 19, 1989, [[United Airlines Flight 232]], carrying 296 people, suffered an in-flight engine failure and was forced to crash-land at [[Sioux City, Iowa]]. 185 survived, while 111 were killed when the plane burst into flames upon touchdown.\n\n==Science and technology==\n{{main|1980s in science and technology}}\n\n===Medicine and biology===\nThe 1980s had many fundamental advances in medicine and biology.

But a variety of factors, including a glut of low-quality games and the rise of home computers, caused a [[North American video game crash of 1983|tremendous crash]] in late 1983. For the next three years, the video game market practically ceased to exist in the US. But in the second half of the decade, it would be revived by [[Nintendo]], whose Famicom console and mascot [[Mario]] had been enjoying considerable success in Japan since 1983. Renamed the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], it would claim 90% of the American video game market by 1989. The 1980s are considered to be the decade when video games achieved massive popularity. In 1980, Pac-Man was introduced to the arcades, and became one of the most popular video games of all time. Also in 1980, [[Game & Watch]] was created; it was not one of the most well known game systems, but it facilitated mini-games and was concurrent with the NES. ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', released in 1981, was a smash arcade hit and market breakthrough for [[Nintendo]]. ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and the ''[[Mega Man]]'' series would become major hits for the console.\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:ColecoVision-Console-FL.jpg|The [[ColecoVision]] video game System.\nFile:NES-Console-Set.jpg|The [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Entertainment System's]] Control Deck.\nFile:Atari-7800-wControl-Pad-L.jpg|[[Atari 7800]] System (PAL system with Joypad controller).\nFile:Sega-Mega-Drive-JP-Mk1-Console-Set.jpg|[[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]], known as the Genesis in North America, succeeded the [[Master System]].\n</gallery>\n\nThe [[personal computer]] experienced explosive growth in the 1980s, transitioning from a hobbyist's toy to a full-fledged consumer product.

[[MSX]] standard was the dominant computer platform in [[Japan]] and in most parts of [[Asia]]. [[Apple Computer]] superseded its [[Apple II series|Apple II]] and [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] models by introducing the first [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] computer in 1984.

Consumer [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s and video rental stores became commonplace as [[VHS]] won out over the competing [[Betamax]] standard. In addition, in the early 1980s various companies began selling compact, modestly priced [[synthesizer]]s to the public. This, along with the development of [[MIDI|Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI), made it easier to integrate and synchronize synthesizers and other electronic instruments, like drum machines, for use in musical composition.\n\nHigh definition television (HDTV) of both the analog and digital variety were first developed in the 1980s though their use did not become widespread until the mid-2000s.\n\nIn 1981, [[Hayes Microcomputer Products]] started selling the Smartmodem. The Smartmodem paved the way for the modern modems that exist today, mainly because it was the first modem to transform what had previously required a two-stage process into a process involving only one stage. The Smartmodem contributed to the rise in popularity of [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] systems in the 1980s and early 1990s, which were the main way to connect to remote computers and perform various social and entertainment activities before the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]] finally became popular in the mid-1990s.\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Motorola DynaTAC.jpg|In 1984, the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X becomes the first commercially available '''[[mobile phone]]''' model\nFile:PIC_0011_Samsung_SF100.jpg|During the decade the standardization of Group 3 facsimile terminals by the International Telecommunication Union contributed to the significant spread of the '''[[fax]]''' machine.\nFile:VHS vs Betamax size.jpg|[[VHS]] won out over the competing '''[[Betamax]]''' standard, becoming the leading standard in home video systems\nFile:Hayes 300 Baud Smartmodem 02.jpg|[[Hayes Microcomputer Products|Hayes]]'s '''Smartmodem'''\n</gallery>\n\n=== Information technology ===\n* During the decade [[Microsoft]] released the operating systems '''[[MS-DOS]]''' (1981), '''[[Windows 1.0]]''' (1985), and '''[[Windows 2.0]]''' (1987).\n* The '''[[CD]]''' - the most basic CD (\"Digital Audio Compact Disc\") was released in October 1982 for distribution and listening to [[digital audio]], and at the time contained up to 74 minutes of music.\n* '''[[TCP/IP]]''': [[ARPANET]] officially changed its main protocol from NCP to [[TCP/IP]] on January 1, 1983, when the new protocols were activated. The TCP/IP protocol will become the dominant communications protocol from then onwards, and would be used as the foundation on which the [[Internet]] would be based.\n* The '''[[GNU Project]]''' (1983). The '''[[Free Software Foundation]]''' (1985).\n* '''[[FidoNet]]''' - In 1984, FidoNet was launched, enabling [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] users to send private messages (e-mails) and public messages (in the forum) between all BBS systems that were connected to the FidoNet network, in addition to sending files to each other. The rise in popularity and availability of the Internet around the world around the mid-1990s eventually contributed to the irrelevance of FidoNet.\n* '''[[World Wide Web]]''' - In 1989, the British computer scientist [[Tim Berners-Lee]] first proposed a project to his employer [[CERN]], based on the concept of [[hypertext]], to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. In mid-November 1989 he would develop the first successful communication between a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) client and server via the [[internet]]. In the coming years Berners-Lee developed the system which would later become the foundation of the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"190\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:MS-Dos screenshot.png|In 1981, Microsoft introduced the [[MS-DOS]] operating system, which would become the world's most widely used [[operating system]] in the 1980s and first half of the 1990s.\nFile:CD autolev crop new.jpg|The most basic [[CD]] was first introduced in October 1982 for the purpose of distribution and listening to digital audio\nFile:Tim Berners-Lee.jpg|In 1989, the British computer scientist [[Tim Berners-Lee]] first proposed the [[World Wide Web]], which he would develop in the coming years \n</gallery>\n\n===Space exploration===\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|The [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] seconds after engine ignition, 1981]]\nAmerican interplanetary probes continued in the 1980s, the Voyager duo being the most known. After making a flyby of Jupiter in 1979, they went near Saturn in 1980–1981. Voyager 2 reached Uranus in 1986 (just a few days before the ''Challenger'' disaster), and Neptune in 1989 before the probes exited the solar system.\n\nNo American probes were launched to Mars in the 1980s, and the [[Viking program|Viking]] probes, launched there in 1975, completed their operations by 1982. The Soviets launched two Mars probes in 1988, but they failed.\n\nThe arrival of [[Halley's Comet]] in 1986 was met by a series of Soviet, Japanese and [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) probes, namely [[Halley Armada]].\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus, American space flights with astronauts resumed with the launch of the space shuttle Columbia in April 1981. The shuttle program progressed smoothly from there, with three more orbiters entering service in 1983–1985. But that all came to an end with the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|tragic loss]] of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']] ([[STS-51-L]]) on January 28, 1986, taking with it seven astronauts, including [[Christa McAuliffe]], who was to have been the first teacher in space. In full view of the world, a faulty O-ring on the right solid rocket booster allowed hot gases to burn through the external fuel tank and cause it to explode, destroying the shuttle in the process. Extensive efforts were made to improve [[NASA]]'s increasingly careless management practices, and to make the shuttle safer. Flights resumed with the launch of [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] in September 1988.\n\nThe Soviet program with cosmonauts went well during the decade, experiencing only minor setbacks. The [[Salyut 6]] space station, launched in 1977, was replaced by [[Salyut 7]] in 1982. Then came ''[[Mir]]'' in 1986, which ended up operating for more than a decade, and was destined to be the last in the line of Soviet space stations that had begun in 1971. One of the Soviet Union's last \"superprojects\" was the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'' space shuttle]]; it was only used once, in 1988.\n\n===Automobiles===\nThe American auto industry began in the 1980s in a thoroughly grim situation, faced with poor quality control, rising import competition, and a severe economic downturn.<ref>{{cite magazine|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924408-8,00.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071130033908/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924408-8,00.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= November 30, 2007 |title=Detroit's Uphill Battle |magazine=Time |date=1980-09-08 |first1=Alexander |last1=Taylor |first2=Christopher |last2=Redman |first3=Barrett |last3=Seaman |access-date=2015-04-18}}</ref> [[Chrysler]] and [[American Motors]] (AMC) were near bankruptcy, and Ford was little better off.<ref>{{cite magazine| first1=Alexander |last1=Taylor |first2=Christopher |last2=Redman |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922223-2,00.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121105153045/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922223-2,00.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= November 5, 2012|title=Detroit's Road Is Still Rocky |magazine=Time |date=1980-12-15 |access-date=2015-04-18}}</ref> Only GM continued with business as usual. But the auto makers recovered with the economy by 1983, and in 1985 auto sales in the United States hit a new record. However, the Japanese were now a major presence, and would begin manufacturing cars in the US to get around tariffs. In 1986, Hyundai became the first Korean auto maker to enter the American market. In the same year, the Yugoslavian-built [[Zastava Koral|Yugo]] was brought to the US, but the car was so small and cheap, that it became the subject of jokes. It was sold up to 1991, when economic sanctions against Yugoslavia forced its withdrawal from the American market.\n\nAs the decade progressed, cars became smaller and more efficient in design. In 1983, Ford design teams began to incorporate aerodynamic styling to decrease drag while in motion. The Thunderbird was one of the first cars to receive these design changes. In 1985, Ford released the Taurus with a design that was revolutionary among domestic mass market automobiles.\n\nGeneral Motors began suffering significant losses in the late 1980s, partially the result of chairman Roger Smith's restructuring attempts, and partially because of increasingly dated cars. An example were customers who increasingly purchased European luxury cars rather than Cadillacs. In 1985, GM started [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] (the first new American make since the Edsel), with the goal of producing high-quality import fighters. Production would not begin until 1990.\n\nChrysler introduced its new compact, front-wheel drive [[Chrysler K platform|K-cars]] in 1981. Under the leadership of [[Lee Iacocca]], the company turned a profit again the following year, and by 1983 paid off its government loans. A succession of models using this automobile platform followed. The most significant were the minivans in 1984. These proved a to be popular and they would dominate the van market for more than a decade. In 1987, Chrysler purchased the Italian makes of Lamborghini and Maserati. In the same year, Chrysler bought AMC from Renault laying to rest the last significant independent U.S. automaker, but acquiring the hugely profitable [[Jeep]] line and continuing the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] brand until the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holusha |first=John |title=Chrysler is Buying American Motors; Cost is $1.5&nbsp;billion |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/10/business/chrysler-is-buying-american-motors-cost-is-1.5-billion.html |work=The New York Times |date=1987-03-10 |access-date=2015-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe [[DMC DeLorean]] was the brainchild of [[John DeLorean]], a flamboyant former GM executive. Production of the gull-winged sports car began in Northern Ireland in 1981. John DeLorean was arrested in October 1982 in a sting operation where he was attempting to sell cocaine to save his struggling company. He was acquitted of all charges in 1984, but too late for the DeLorean Motor Company, which closed down in 1983. The DeLorean gained renewed fame afterward as the time machine in the [[Back to the Future (series)|''Back to the Future'' film trilogy]].\n\nThe imposition of CAFE fuel-mileage standards in 1979 spelled the end of big-block engines, but performance cars and convertibles reemerged in the 1980s. Turbochargers were widely used to boost the performance of small cars, and technology from [[fuel injection]] began to take over from the widely used application of [[carburetors]] by the late 1980s. Front-wheel drive also became dominant.\n\nThe Eighties marked the decline of European brands in North America by the end of the decade. [[Renault]], [[Citroen]], and [[Peugeot]] ceased importation by the end of the decade. [[Alfa Romeo]] would continue until 1993. [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] also ceased imports to North America in the Eighties.\n\n==Economics==\n* The early 1980s was marked by a severe global [[Early 1980s recession|economic recession]] that affected much of the developed world.\n* Inflation peaked in the U.S. in April 1980 at 14.76% and subsequently fell to a low of 1.10% in December 1986 but then rebounded to 4.65% at the end of the decade.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inflation and CPI Consumer Price Index 1980–1989|url=http://inflationdata.com/articles/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-1980-1989/|website=InflationData.com|access-date=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n* Finland's economy grew by almost the fastest pace in the world, which eventually culminated in the recession of the 1990s Finnish economy. In Finland, the 1980s were called the \"Nousukausi\", or \"economic upswing\".\n* International debt crisis in developing countries, reliance of these countries on aid from the [[International Monetary Fund]].\n* Revival of [[laissez-faire economics|laissez faire]]/[[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics in the developed world led by the UK and US governments emphasising reduced government intervention, lower taxes and deregulation of the stock markets associated with an economic revival in the mid- to late-1980s. Consumers became more sophisticated in their tastes (a trend begun in the 1960s), and things such as European cars and designer clothing became fashionable in the US.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n* Brazil and Mexico suffers from a [[Latin American debt crisis|debt crisis in Latin America]] starting in 1982 under President [[João Figueiredo]] and [[Miguel de la Madrid]].

The Plan was a near failure, as most of the targets were not met. With the ascent of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], the twelfth Five-Year Plan sought to [[Uskoreniye|accelerate]] and [[Perestroika|restructure]] the Soviet economy through reforms to decentralize production and distribution systems.\n* Under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]], China embarked on [[Chinese economic reform|extensive reforms]] in the 1980s, opening the country's economy to the West and allowing capitalist enterprises to operate in a [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|market socialist system]].

Attempts by the Communist government to prevent the rise of the Solidarity movement failed and negotiations between the movement and the government took place. Solidarity would be instrumental in encouraging people in other communist states to demand political reform.\n* The financial world and the stock market were glamorized in a way they had not been since the 1920s, and figures like [[Donald Trump]] and [[Michael Milken]] were widely seen as symbols of the decade. Widespread fear of Japanese economic strength would grip the United States in the '80s.\n* The \"Black Monday\" [[stock market crash]] on October 19, 1987, decreased the value of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] by more than 22%, causing widespread secondary drops in world markets.\n* During the 1980s, for the first time in world history, transpacific trade (with [[East Asia]], such as China, and [[Latin America]], primarily with Mexico) equaled that of transatlantic trade (with [[Western Europe]] or with neighboring Canada),<ref>\"The Next Hundred Years\", George Friedman, 2009, pg 4</ref> solidifying American economic power.<ref>\"The Next Hundred Years\", George Friedman, 2009, pg 45</ref>\n* [[Savings and loan crisis|The Savings and Loan crisis]] and [[Keating Five|Keating five]] scandal.\n*  The phrase [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]], used in reference to the sudden deregulation of financial markets, was coined to describe measures, including abolition of fixed commission charges and of the distinction between stockjobbers and stockbrokers on the London Stock Exchange and change from open-outcry to electronic, screen-based trading, effected by Margaret Thatcher in 1986.\n\n==Popular culture==\n<gallery widths=\"190\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:NES-Console-Set.jpg|The [[third generation of video game consoles]] like [[SG-1000]], [[Master System]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (pictured), and [[Atari 7800]] were released in the 1980s.\nFile:Full House 1987 TV series logo.png| TV shows like ''[[Full House]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'',  ''[[EastEnders]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', ''[[Knots Landing]]'', and ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' were popular in the 1980s. \nFile:Michael Jackson Thriller Jacket.jpg|[[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' became the best-selling album of all time, followed by the critically acclaimed album ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' five years later, and a musical film adaptation titled ''[[Moonwalker]]''.\nFile:MTV Logo.svg|[[MTV]] was launched in 1981, which had a great influence on the way music is marketed and on the rise of many prominent rock stars during the decade.

They were [[Princess Diana]]'s favorite band. In 1982, they released their world famous, omnipresent [[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]] which ignited a global craze. Their catchy flagship song from the album, [[Hungry Like the Wolf]], reached number 1 in Canada, number 3 in the United States, number 4 in Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa and number 5 in the United Kingdom and Australia. It won a Grammy Award in 1984. [[Rio (song)|The title track]] was another mega hit song that was issued worldwide in October 1982 and became a Top 10 hit in the UK Singles Chart. As of October 2021, \"Rio\" was the third most streamed Duran Duran song in the UK. By 1985, the musical band stood on top of the world as absolute conquerors of music and music video. They were the darlings of MTV and the center of female teen fan's attention. In that same year, the [[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]] theme song to the same-titled [[James Bond]] movie reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and it remains the only Bond theme to achieve this chart placing. Their massive appeal was widespread on a worldwide scale in music, video and fashion. Their influence was so intense that they helped shape how music was defined throughout the 80s decade. They extensively toured the US, Canada, Australia, Europe, Mexico, South America, Japan and other parts of Asia. Highly stylized videos showcasing their other mega hit songs like, [[Planet Earth (Duran Duran song)|Planet Earth]], [[New Moon on Monday]], [[The Wild Boys (song)|The Wild Boys]], [[Save a Prayer]] and [[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]] made Duran Duran a popular household name.\n\n[[Michael Jackson]] was one of the icons of the 1980s and his [[leather jacket]], white [[glove]], and [[Moonwalk dance]] were often imitated. Jackson's 1982 album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' became—and currently remains—the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling album of all time]], with sales estimated by various sources as somewhere between 65 and 110 million copies worldwide. His 1987 album ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' sold over 45 million copies and became the first album to have five number-one singles chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Jackson had the most number-one singles throughout the decade (9), and spent the most weeks at number one (27 weeks). His 1987 [[Bad (tour)|Bad World Tour]] grossed over $125 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing world tour by a solo artist during the decade. Jackson earned numerous awards and titles during the 1980s, the most notable of which were a record eight [[Grammy Award]]s and eight [[American Music Award]]s in 1984, and the honor of \"Artist of the Decade\" by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush.]] Jackson was arguably the biggest star during this time, and would eventually sell more than one billion records around the world.\n\n[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] was a popular star of the 1980s and the most successful chart act of the decade. His breakthrough album [[1999 (Prince album)|''1999'']], released in 1982, produced three top-ten hits and the album itself charted at number nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. His sixth studio album [[Purple Rain (album)|''Purple Rain'']] was an international success, boosting Prince to superstardom and selling over 25 million copies worldwide. The album produced the US number-one singles, \"[[When Doves Cry]]\" and \"[[Let's Go Crazy]]\" and sold 13 million copies in the U.S. as of 1996. Prince released an album every year for the rest of the decade, all charting within the top ten, with the exception of ''[[Lovesexy]]''. In the [[1990s]], he infamously changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol in response to a record dispute with [[Warner Brothers]].

Groundbreaking artists such as [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[George Strait]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Janie Fricke]], [[The Judds]], and [[Randy Travis]] achieved multiple platinum and award status, foreshadowing the genre's popularity explosion in the 1990s.

The [[house music]] style, another form of electronic dance music, emerged in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in the early 1980s. It was initially popularized in mid-1980s discothèques catering to the African-American, Latino and gay communities, first in Chicago, then in New York City and Detroit. It eventually reached Europe before becoming infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide.\n\n[[Punk rock]] continued to make strides in the musical community.

[[College rock]] caught on in the underground scene of the 1980s in a nationwide movement with a distinct [[DIY ethic|D.I.Y]] approach.

In the mid-1980s, a wave of British directors, including [[Ridley Scott]], [[Alan Parker]], [[Adrian Lyne]] and [[Tony Scott]] (with the latter directing a number of Don Simpson films) ushered in a new era of blockbusters using the crowd-pleasing skills they had honed in UK television commercials.<ref>{{cite news|first=Delaney|last=Sam|title=Jets, jeans and Hovis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/24/1|agency=The Guardian|date=August 24, 2007|access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA significant development in the home media business is the establishment of [[The Criterion Collection]] in 1984, an American company \"dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality\".

Films such as ''[[Class (film)|Class]]'', ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'', ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'', ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'', ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'', ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', and ''[[Valley Girl (1983 film)|Valley Girl]]'' were popular teen comedies of the era and launched the careers of several major celebrities such as: [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]], [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Andrew McCarthy]], [[Judd Nelson]], [[Molly Ringwald]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Michael J. Fox]]. Other popular films included ''[[About Last Night (1986 film)|About Last Night...]]'', ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', ''[[Flashdance]]'', ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', ''[[Raging Bull]]'' and ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' which also launched the careers of high-profile celebrities like [[Demi Moore]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Patrick Swayze]], and [[River Phoenix]].\n\nHorror films were a popular genre during the decade, with several notable horror franchises being born during the 1980s. Among the most popular were the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]],'' ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Child's Play (film series)|Child's Play]]'', ''[[Hellraiser (franchise)|Hellraiser]]'', and ''[[Poltergeist (film series)|Poltergeist]]'' franchises. ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' although a popular film from 1980 decades later, it was initially met with mixed reviews from critics and even the [[Stephen King|author]] of the [[The Shining (novel)|book]], and was moderately successful financially. Aside from these films, the concept of the [[B movie|B horror film]] gave rise to a plethora of horror films that went on to earn a cult status. An example of such is the 1981 film ''[[The Evil Dead]]'', which marked the directorial debut of [[Sam Raimi]]. Comedy horror films such as ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and ''[[Gremlins]]'' also gained cult status.\n\nSeveral action film franchises were also introduced during the 1980s. The most popular of these were the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'', ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'', ''[[Lethal Weapon (film series)|Lethal Weapon]]'', and ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' franchises. Other action films from the decade which are of notable status include ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Escape from New York]]'', ''[[Red Dawn]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', and ''[[RoboCop]]''. These films propelled the careers of modern celebrities such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Danny Glover]], and [[Charlie Sheen]] to international recognition. On the other side of the globe, [[Hong Kong action cinema]] and [[martial arts film]]s were being revolutionized by a new wave of inventive filmmakers that include [[Jackie Chan]], [[Sammo Hung]], [[Tsui Hark]], and [[John Woo]], while the American martial arts film movement was being led by actors like [[Chuck Norris]], [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] and [[Steven Seagal]].\n\nFive more [[James bond films]] were released, with [[Roger Moore]] continuing in the role in ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', ''[[Octopussy (film)|Octopussy]]'', and ''[[A View to a Kill (film)|A View To A Kill]]'', before handing over the role to [[Timothy Dalton]] who starred in ''[[The Living Daylights (film)|The Living Daylights]]'' and ''[[Licence to Kill (film)|Licence To Kill]]''.\n\n'''Animated films'''\n\nAlthough [[animated feature films]] did not gain mainstream popularity until the mid to late-1990s due to public preference of television animation, some important films were produced during the decade. After leaving [[Disney]] in 1979, [[Don Bluth]] formed [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|his own studio]] and went on direct ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'', ''[[An American Tail]]'', ''[[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]'' and ''[[All Dogs Go To Heaven]]''. At the same time, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|the Disney studio]] wasn't having good times and almost bankrupted after ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' bombed at the box office. However, in later years, they slowly recovered with the modest success of [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] directed ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'', the live-action animated hybrid [[Robert Zemeckis]] directed ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' co-produced with Steven Spielberg, and eventually regained public confidence following the release of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''.

Other well-known anime films of that decade include ''[[Golgo 13: The Professional]]'', ''[[Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'', ''[[Lensman (1984 film)|Lensman]]'', ''[[Vampire Hunter D (1985 film)|Vampire Hunter D]]'', ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]],'' ''[[Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland]]'' and the ''[[Urusei Yatsura (film series)|Urusei Yatsura film series]]''.

It was bundled with ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and it suddenly became a success. The NES dominated the American and Japanese market until the rise of the next generation of consoles in the early 1990s, causing some to call this time the ''[[Nintendo era]]''. [[Sega]] released its 16-bit console, [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], in 1988 in Japan and in North America in 1989.\nIn 1989, Nintendo released the [[Game Boy]], a monochrome handheld console.\n{{Clear}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"190\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:PacmanUserbox.gif|The game ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980) became immensely popular and an icon of 1980s popular culture\nFile:Donkey Kong arcade - zapwizard 34102189 (cropped).jpg|The popular 1980s arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]''\nFile:Game & Watch WS- Snoopy Tennis.jpg|[[Game & Watch]] was the popular mobile game during the decade until it was replaced in the early 1990s with more advanced [[Game Boy]].\n</gallery>\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\n{{Main|1980s in fashion}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-1018-012, Berlin, Modeausblick.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A German couple in 1985.]]\nThe beginning of the decade saw the continuation of the clothing styles of the [[1970s in fashion|late 1970s]] and evolved into [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fashion by the end. However,  fashion became more extravagant during the 1980s. The 1980s included  teased and colourfully-dyed hair, ripped jeans, neon clothing and many colours and different designs which at first were not accepted.\n\nSignificant hairstyle trends of the 1980s include the [[Perm (hairstyle)|perm]], the [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]], the [[Jheri curl]], the [[hi-top fade]], and [[big hair]].\n\nSignificant clothing trends of the 1980s include [[Shoulder pads (fashion)#1980s|shoulder pads]], [[Denim|jean jackets]], [[leather]] pants, leather [[aviator jacket]]s, [[jumpsuit]]s, [[Members Only (fashion brand)|Members Only jackets]], [[Slim-fit pants#The 1980s|skin-tight acid-washed jeans]], [[Izod Lacoste]] and \"preppy\" [[polo shirt]]s, [[leggings]] and [[leg warmer]]s (popularized in the film ''[[Flashdance]]''), off-the-shoulder shirts, and cut sweatshirts (popularized in the same film).\n\n[[Miniskirt]]s returned to mainstream fashion in the mid-1980s after a ten-year absence, mostly made of [[denim]] material. From that point on, miniskirts and minidresses have remained in mainstream fashion to this day.\n\nMakeup on the 1980s was aggressive, shining and colourful. Women emphasised their lips, eyebrows and cheeks with makeup. They used much [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] and [[Eye liner|eyeliner]].\n\nAdditional trends of the 1980s include athletic [[headband]]s, [[Ray-Ban Aviator]] sunglasses (popularized in the film ''[[Top Gun]]''), [[Ray-Ban Wayfarer|Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses]] (popularized in the films ''[[Risky Business]]'' and ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' and the TV series ''[[Miami Vice]]''), [[Swatch#A fashion statement|Swatch watches]], and the [[Rubik's Cube]] (became a popular fad throughout the decade).

The end of [[World War II]] saw the United States, France, United Kingdom, [[Soviet Union]] and the Republic of China emerging as the primary victors.

Unlike most century years, the year [[2000]] was a [[leap year]], and the second [[century leap year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]] after [[1600]].\n\nThe century had the first [[World war|global-scale]] [[total war]]s between world powers across continents and oceans in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. [[Nationalism]] became a major political issue in the world in the 20th century, acknowledged in [[international law]] along with the right of nations to [[self-determination]], official [[decolonization]] in the mid-century, and related regional conflicts.\n\nThe century saw a major shift in the way that many people lived, with changes in politics, ideology, economics, society, culture, science, technology, and medicine. The 20th century may have seen more technological and scientific progress than all the other centuries combined since the dawn of civilization. Terms like ''[[nationalism]]'', ''[[globalism]]'', ''environmentalism'', ''ideology'', ''[[world war]]'', ''[[genocide]],'' and ''[[nuclear war]]'' entered common usage. Scientific discoveries, such as the [[theory of relativity]] and [[quantum physics]], profoundly changed the foundational models of physical science, forcing scientists to realize that the universe was more complex than previously believed, and dashing the hopes (or fears) at the end of the 19th century that the last few details of scientific knowledge were about to be filled in. It was a century that started with horses, simple automobiles, and [[Cargo ship|freighters]] but ended with [[high-speed rail]], [[cruise ships]], global [[Airline|commercial air travel]] and the [[Space Shuttle]]. Horses and other [[pack animal]]s, every society's basic form of personal transportation for thousands of years, were replaced by automobiles and buses within a few decades. These developments were made possible by the exploitation of [[fossil fuel]] resources, which offered energy in an easily portable form, but also caused concern about pollution and long-term impact on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Humans explored [[outer space|space]] for the first time, taking their first footsteps on the [[Moon]].\n\n[[File:World_1914_empires_colonies_territory.PNG|thumb|750px|center|{{center|World powers and empires in 1914, just before the First World War. <br /> }}]]\n\nMass media, telecommunications, and information technology (especially computers, [[paperback book]]s, [[public education]], and the [[Internet]]) made the world's knowledge more widely available. Public health improvements led to global life expectancy increasing from 35 years to 65 years. Rapid technological advancements, however, also allowed warfare to reach unprecedented levels of destruction. World War II alone killed over 60 million people, while [[nuclear weapons]] gave humankind the means to annihilate itself in a short time. However, these same wars resulted in the destruction of the imperial system. For the first time in human history, empires and their wars of expansion and colonization ceased to be a factor in international affairs, resulting in a far more globalized and cooperative world. The last time major powers clashed openly was in 1945, and since then, violence has seen an unprecedented decline.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/betterangelsofou00pink|title=The Better Angels of Our Nature|last1=Pinker|first1=Stephen|date=2011|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0-670-02295-3}}</ref>\n\nThe world also became more [[Cultural homogenization|culturally homogenized]] than ever with developments in transportation and communications technology, [[popular music]] and other influences of [[Western culture]], [[Multinational corporation|international corporations]], and what was arguably a truly [[economic globalization|global economy]] by the end of the 20th century.\n\n===Summary===\nAt the beginning of the period, the [[British Empire]] was the world's most powerful nation,<ref name=\"ferguson\">{{Cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |year=2004 |title=Empire: The rise and demise of the British world order and the lessons for global power |publisher=Basic Books |location =New York |isbn=978-0-465-02328-8}}</ref> having [[Pax Britannica|acted as the world's policeman]] for the past century.\n\nTechnological advancements during [[World War I]] changed the way war was fought, as new inventions such as [[tank]]s, [[chemical weapons]], and aircraft modified tactics and strategy. After more than four years of [[trench warfare]] in Western Europe, and up to 22 million dead, the powers that had formed the [[Triple Entente]] ([[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], later replaced by the United States and joined by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]) emerged victorious over the [[Central Powers]] ([[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]). In addition to annexing many of the [[Colony|colonial possessions]] of the vanquished states, the Triple Entente exacted punitive restitution payments from them, plunging Germany in particular into [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|economic depression]]. The Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires were dismantled at the war's conclusion. The [[Russian Revolution]] resulted in the overthrow of the [[Tsar]]ist regime of [[Nicholas II]] and the onset of the [[Russian Civil War]]. The victorious [[Bolsheviks]] then established the [[Soviet Union]], the world's first [[communist state]].\n\n[[File:League of Nations Anachronous Map.PNG|thumb|Anachronous world map showing [[member states of the League of Nations]], the first [[Global governance|global international body of governance]] created to prevent war after [[World War I]], during its 26-year [[interwar period]] history.]]\n\n[[Fascism]], a movement which grew out of post-war [[angst]] and which accelerated during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, gained momentum in [[Italian Fascism|Italy]], [[Nazism|Germany]], and [[Falangism|Spain]] in the 1920s and 1930s, culminating in [[World War II]], sparked by [[Nazi Germany]]'s aggressive expansion at the expense of its neighbors. Meanwhile, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] had rapidly transformed itself into a technologically advanced industrial power and, along with Germany and Italy, formed the [[Axis powers]].

After the victory of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in Europe, the [[Pacific War|war in Asia]] ended with the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] and the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping of two atomic bombs]] on Japan by the US, the first nation to develop [[nuclear weapons]] and the only one to use them in warfare. In total, World War II left some 60 million people dead.\n\n[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|left|The [[mushroom cloud]] of the detonation of [[Little Boy]], the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first nuclear attack]] in history, on 6 August 1945 over [[Hiroshima]], igniting the [[nuclear age]] with the international security dominating thread of [[mutual assured destruction]] in the latter half of the 20th century.]]\n\nFollowing World War II, the United Nations, successor to the [[League of Nations]], was established as an international forum in which the world's nations could discuss issues diplomatically. It enacted [[United Nations resolution|resolutions]] on such topics as the conduct of warfare, environmental protection, international [[sovereignty]], and human rights. [[Peacekeeping]] forces consisting of troops provided by various countries, with various United Nations and other aid agencies, helped to relieve famine, disease, and poverty, and to suppress some local armed conflicts. Europe slowly united, economically and, in some ways, politically, to form the [[European Union]], which consisted of 15 European countries by the end of the 20th century.\n\nAfter the war, Germany was [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupied]] and divided between the [[Western Bloc|Western]] powers and the Soviet Union. [[East Germany]] and the rest of [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]] became Soviet [[puppet states]] under communist rule. Western Europe was rebuilt with the aid of the American [[Marshall Plan]], resulting in a major [[Post–World War II economic expansion|post-war economic boom]], and many of the affected nations became close allies of the United States.\n\nWith the Axis defeated and Britain and France rebuilding, the United States and the Soviet Union were left standing as the world's only superpowers. Allies during the war, they soon became hostile to one another as their competing ideologies of [[communism]] and [[democratic capitalism]] proliferated in Europe, which became divided by the [[Iron Curtain]] and the [[Berlin Wall]]. They formed competing military alliances ([[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]) which engaged in a decades-long standoff known as the [[Cold War]]. The period was marked by a [[Nuclear arms race|new arms race]] as the USSR became the second nation to develop nuclear weapons, which were produced by both sides in sufficient numbers to [[Nuclear holocaust|end most human life on the planet]] had a large-scale nuclear exchange ever occurred. [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutually assured destruction]] is credited by many historians as having prevented such an exchange, each side being unable to [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|strike first]] at the other without ensuring an equally devastating [[Second strike|retaliatory strike]]. Unable to engage one another directly, the conflict played out in a series of [[proxy war]]s around the world—particularly in [[Chinese Civil War|China]], [[Korean War|Korea]], [[Cuban revolution|Cuba]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghanistan]]—as the USSR sought to [[World communism|export communism]] while the US attempted to [[Containment|contain it]]. The technological competition between the two sides led to substantial investment in [[research and development]] which produced innovations that reached far beyond the battlefield, such as [[Space Race|space exploration]] and the Internet.\n\n[[File:Africa independence dates.PNG|thumb|The international community grew in the second half of the century significantly due to a new wave of decolonization, particularly in Africa. Most of the newly independent states, were grouped together with many other so called [[developing countries]].

Meanwhile, [[globalization]] opened the door for several nations to exert a strong influence over many world affairs. The US's global military presence spread [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] around the world with the advent of the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood motion picture industry]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[jazz]], rock music, and pop music, fast food and [[hippy]] counterculture, [[hip-hop]], [[house music]], and [[disco]], as well as [[street style]], all of which came to be identified with the concepts of popular culture and [[youth culture]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Delaney |first1=Tim |title=Pop Culture: An Overview |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/64/Pop_Culture_An_Overview |website=Philosophy Now |access-date=12 September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bell |last2=Bell |first1=P. |first2=R. |title=\"Americanization\": Political and cultural examples from the perspective of \"Americanized\" Australia |journal=American Studies |date=1996 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/162640366.pdf |access-date=12 September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Malchow |first1=Howard |title=Special Relations: The Americanization of Britain? |date=2011 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-804-77399-7}}</ref> After [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union collapsed]] under internal pressure in 1991, most of the communist governments it had supported around the world [[Revolutions of 1989|were dismantled]]—with the notable exceptions of China, [[North Korea]], [[Cuba]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Laos]]—followed by awkward transitions into market economies.\n\n=== Nature of innovation and change ===\nDue to continuing industrialization and expanding trade, many significant changes of the century were, directly or indirectly, economic and technological in nature. Inventions such as the [[light bulb]], the [[automobile]], and the telephone in the late 19th century, followed by [[supertanker]]s, [[airliner]]s, motorways, [[radio]], [[television]], air conditioning, [[antibiotics]], [[nuclear power]], [[frozen food]], [[computers]] and [[microcomputer]]s, the Internet, and [[mobile telephone]]s affected people's [[quality of life]] across the developed world. The quantity of goods consumed by the average person expanded massively. Scientific research, engineering professionalization and technological development—much of it motivated by the [[Cold War]] arms race—drove changes in everyday life.\n\n=== Social change ===\n[[File:Martin_Luther_King_-_March_on_Washington.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]], an [[African Americans|African American]] civil rights leader ([[I Have a Dream|Washington, August 1963]])]]\n\nAt the beginning of the century, strong discrimination based on race and sex was significant in most societies. Although the [[Atlantic slave trade]] had ended in the 19th century, movements for equality for non-white people in the white-dominated societies of [[Civil rights movement|North America]], Europe, and [[Apartheid|South Africa]] continued. By the end of the 20th century, in many parts of the world, women had the same legal rights as men, and racism had come to be seen as unacceptable, a sentiment often backed up by legislation.<ref>Fleegler, Robert L.

China, an ancient nation comprising a fifth of the world population, was finally [[Chinese economic reform|open to the world]], creating a new state after the near-complete destruction of the old cultural order. With the end of colonialism and the Cold War, nearly a billion people in Africa were left in new nation states.\n\nThe world was undergoing its second major period of [[globalization]]; the first, which started in the 18th century, having been terminated by World War I. Since the US was in a dominant position, a major part of the process was [[Americanization]]. The influence of China and India was also rising, as the world's largest populations were rapidly integrating with the world economy.\n\n[[Terrorism]], dictatorship, and the spread of [[nuclear weapon]]s were pressing [[global issues]].

In the process, the internal structure of [[atom]]s came to be clearly understood, followed by the discovery of [[elementary particle]]s.\n* It was found that all the known [[force]]s can be traced to only four [[fundamental interaction]]s. It was discovered further that two forces, [[electromagnetism]] and [[weak interaction]], can be merged in the [[electroweak interaction]], leaving only three different fundamental interactions.\n* Discovery of [[nuclear reaction]]s, in particular [[nuclear fusion]], finally revealed the source of [[sun|solar]] energy.\n* [[Radiocarbon dating]] was invented, and became a powerful technique for determining the age of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] animals and plants as well as historical objects.\n\n=== Astronomy ===\n* A much better understanding of the evolution of the [[universe]] was achieved, its [[Age of the universe|age]] (about 13.8&nbsp;billion years) was determined, and the [[Big Bang]] theory on its origin was proposed and generally accepted.\n* The age of the [[Solar System]], including Earth, was determined, and it turned out to be much older than believed earlier: more than 4&nbsp;billion years, rather than the 20 million years suggested by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1862.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=Sir William |title=On the Age of the Sun's Heat |journal=Macmillan's Magazine |year=1862 |volume=5 |pages=288–293 |url=http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_the_age_of_the_suns_heat.html}}</ref>\n* The planets of the Solar System and their moons were closely observed via numerous [[space probe]]s. [[Pluto]] was discovered in 1930 on the edge of the solar system, although in the early 21st century, it was reclassified as a [[dwarf planet]] instead of a planet proper, leaving eight planets.\n* No trace of life was discovered on any of the other planets orbiting [[Sun|the Sun]] (or elsewhere in the universe), although it remained undetermined whether some forms of primitive life might exist, or might have existed, somewhere in the Solar System. [[Extrasolar planets]] were observed for the first time.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Wheat yields in Least Developed Countries.svg|thumb|Wheat yields greatly increased from the [[Green Revolution]] in the world's [[least developed countries]].]]\n\n*[[Norman Borlaug]] fathered the [[Green Revolution]], the set of research [[technology transfer]] initiatives occurring between 1950 and the late 1960s that increased agricultural production in parts of the world, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s, and is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.\n\n=== Biology ===\n* [[Genetics]] was unanimously accepted and significantly developed. The [[structure of DNA]] was determined in 1953 by [[James D. Watson|James Watson]],<ref name=\"nobelmedicine1962\">{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/|work=NobelPrize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|access-date=November 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Franklin\"/> [[Francis Crick]],<ref name=\"nobelmedicine1962\"/><ref name=\"Franklin\"/> [[Rosalind Franklin]]<ref name=\"Franklin\">{{cite web |title=James Watson, Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/james-watson-francis-crick-maurice-wilkins-and-rosalind-franklin |work=Science History Institute |access-date=20 March 2018 |date=June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321132408/https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/james-watson-francis-crick-maurice-wilkins-and-rosalind-franklin |archive-date=21 March 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[Maurice Wilkins]],<ref name=\"nobelmedicine1962\"/><ref name=\"Franklin\"/> following by developing techniques which allow to read DNA sequences and culminating in starting the [[Human Genome Project]] (not finished in the 20th century) and [[Dolly (sheep)|cloning the first mammal]] in 1996.\n* The role of [[sexual reproduction]] in evolution was understood, and [[bacterial conjugation]] was discovered.\n* The convergence of various sciences for the formulation of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] (produced between 1936 and 1947), providing a widely accepted account of [[evolution]].\n\n=== Medicine ===\n[[File:Faroe stamp 079 europe (fleming).jpg|thumb|right|A stamp commemorating [[Alexander Fleming]]. His discovery of [[penicillin]] changed the world of medicine by introducing the age of antibiotics.]]\n\n* [[Placebo]]-[[scientific control|controlled]], [[random sample|randomized]], [[blind experiment|blinded]] [[clinical trial]]s became a powerful tool for testing new medicines.\n* [[Antibiotics]] drastically reduced mortality from [[bacterial disease]]s.\n* A [[vaccine]] was developed for [[polio]], ending a worldwide epidemic. Effective vaccines were also developed for a number of other serious infectious diseases, including [[influenza vaccine|influenza]], [[DPT vaccine|diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus]], [[MMR vaccine|measles]], [[mumps vaccine|mumps]], [[MMR vaccine|rubella (German measles)]], [[varicella vaccine|chickenpox]], [[hepatitis A vaccine|hepatitis A]], and [[hepatitis B vaccine|hepatitis B]].\n* [[Epidemiology]] and [[vaccination]] led to the eradication of the [[smallpox]] virus in humans.\n* [[X-ray]]s became a powerful diagnostic tool for a wide spectrum of diseases, from bone fractures to cancer. In the 1960s, [[computerized tomography]] was invented. Other important diagnostic tools developed were [[sonography]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]].\n* Development of [[vitamins]] virtually eliminated [[scurvy]] and other vitamin-deficiency diseases from industrialized societies.\n* New psychiatric drugs were developed. These include [[antipsychotic]]s for treating [[hallucination]]s and [[delusion]]s, and [[antidepressant]]s for treating depression.\n* The role of [[tobacco smoking]] in the causation of cancer and other diseases was proven during the 1950s (see [[British Doctors Study]]).\n* New methods for cancer treatment, including [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], and [[immunotherapy]], were developed. As a result, cancer could often be [[cure]]d or placed in [[remission (medicine)|remission]].\n* The development of [[blood type|blood typing]] and [[blood bank]]ing made [[blood transfusion]] safe and widely available.\n* The [[invention]] and development of [[immunosuppressive drug]]s and [[tissue typing]] made [[organ transplant|organ and tissue transplantation]] a clinical reality.\n* New methods for [[heart surgery]] were developed, including [[pacemaker]]s and [[artificial heart]]s.\n* [[Cocaine]] and heroin were widely illegalized after being found to be addictive and destructive. [[Psychoactive drug]]s such as [[LSD]] and [[MDMA]] were discovered and subsequently prohibited in many countries. [[Prohibition of drugs]] caused a growth in the black market drug industry, and [[War on drugs|expanded enforcement]] led to a larger prison population in some countries.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Engel|first=Pamela|date=April 23, 2014|title=Watch How Quickly The War On Drugs Changed America's Prison Population|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-war-on-drugs-changed-americas-prison-population-2014-4?op=1|website=Business Insider}}</ref>\n* [[Contraceptive]] drugs were developed, which reduced population growth rates in industrialized countries, as well as decreased the taboo of [[premarital sex]] throughout many western countries.\n* The development of medical [[insulin]] during the 1920s helped raise the life expectancy of [[diabetes|diabetics]] to three times of what it had been earlier.\n* Vaccines, hygiene and clean water improved health and decreased mortality rates, especially among infants and the young.\n\n==== Notable diseases ====\n* An [[influenza]] pandemic, [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Flu]], killed anywhere from 17 to 100 million people between 1918 and 1919.\n* A new [[virus|viral]] disease, called the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]], or HIV, arose in Africa and subsequently killed millions of people throughout the world. HIV leads to a syndrome called [[Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome]], or AIDS. Treatments for HIV remained inaccessible to many people living with AIDS and HIV in [[developing countries]], and a cure has yet to be discovered.\n* Because of increased [[Life expectancy|life spans]], the [[prevalence]] of cancer, [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and other diseases of [[old age]] increased slightly.\n* Changes in food production, along with [[sedentary lifestyle]]s due to labor-saving devices and the increase in home entertainment, contributed to an \"epidemic\" of [[obesity]], at first in the rich countries, but by the end of the 20th century spreading to the developing world.\n\n=== Energy and the environment ===\n[[File:Oilfields California.jpg|thumb|[[Oil field]] in California, 1938.\n\nThe first modern oil well was drilled in 1848 by Russian engineer F.N. Semyonov, on the [[Apsheron Peninsula]] north-east of [[Baku]].]]\n* [[Fossil fuels]] and [[nuclear power]] were the dominant forms of energy sources.\n* Widespread use of petroleum in industry—both as a chemical precursor to plastics and as a fuel for the automobile and airplane—led to the geopolitical importance of petroleum resources. The Middle East, home to many of the world's oil deposits, became a center of geopolitical and military tension throughout the latter half of the century. (For example, oil was a factor in Japan's decision to go to war against the United States in 1941, and the oil cartel, [[OPEC]], used an oil embargo of sorts in the wake of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in the 1970s).\n* The increase in [[fossil fuel]] consumption also fueled a major scientific controversy over its effect on air pollution, [[global warming]], and global [[climate change]].\n* [[Pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s and other [[toxicity|toxic]] [[chemical substance|chemicals]] accumulated in the environment, including in the bodies of humans and other animals.\n* [[Population growth]] and worldwide [[deforestation]] diminished the [[environmental quality|quality of the environment]].\n* In the last third of the century, concern about humankind's impact on the Earth's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] made environmentalism popular. In many countries, especially in Europe, the movement was channeled into politics through [[Green party|Green parties]]. Increasing awareness of [[global warming]] began in the 1980s, commencing decades of social and political debate.\n\n== Engineering and technology ==\n[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|right|First flight of the [[Wright brothers]]' ''[[Wright Flyer]]'' on December 17, 1903, in [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]]; Orville piloting with Wilbur running at wingtip.]]\n\nOne of the prominent traits of the 20th century was the dramatic growth of technology. Organized research and practice of science led to advancement in the fields of communication, electronics, engineering, travel, medicine, and war.\n* Basic [[home appliance]]s including [[washing machine]]s, [[clothes dryer]]s, furnaces, [[exercise machine]]s, [[dishwashers]], [[refrigerator]]s, freezers, [[electric stove]]s and [[vacuum cleaner]]s became popular from the 1920s through the 1950s. Radios were popularized as a form of entertainment during the 1920s, followed by television during the 1950s.\n* The first airplane, the ''[[Wright Flyer]]'', was flown in 1903. With the engineering of the faster [[jet engine]] in the 1940s, mass [[air travel]] became commercially viable.\n* The [[assembly line]] made mass production of the automobile viable. By the end of the 20th century, billions of people had automobiles for personal transportation. The combination of the automobile, [[motor boat]]s and air travel allowed for unprecedented personal mobility. In western nations, motor vehicle accidents became the greatest cause of death for young people. However, expansion of [[divided highway]]s reduced the death rate.\n* The [[triode|triode tube]] was invented.\n*Air conditioning of buildings became common\n* New materials, most notably [[stainless steel]], [[Velcro]], [[silicone]], [[polytetrafluoroethylene|teflon]], and plastics such as [[polystyrene]], [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[polyethylene]], and nylon came into widespread use for many various applications. These materials typically have tremendous performance gains in strength, temperature, chemical resistance, or mechanical properties over those known prior to the 20th century.\n* Aluminum became an inexpensive metal and became second only to iron in use.\n* Thousands of [[chemical]]s were developed for industrial processing and home use.\n* Digital computers came into use\n\n=== Space exploration ===\n[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|Photo of American astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] during the [[Apollo 11|first moonwalk]] in 1969, taken by [[Neil Armstrong]]. The relatively young [[aerospace engineering]] industries rapidly grew in the 66 years after the Wright brothers' first flight.]]\n* The [[Space Race]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] gave a peaceful outlet to the political and military tensions of the [[Cold War]], leading to the first [[human spaceflight]] with the Soviet Union's [[Vostok 1]] mission in 1961, and man's first landing on another world—the [[Moon]]—with America's [[Apollo 11]] mission in 1969. Later, the first [[space station]] was launched by the [[Soviet space program]]. The United States developed the first reusable spacecraft system with the [[Space Shuttle program]], first launched in 1981. As the century ended, a permanent crewed presence in space was being founded with the ongoing construction of the [[International Space Station]].\n* In addition to human spaceflight, uncrewed space probes became a practical and relatively inexpensive form of exploration. The first orbiting space probe, [[Sputnik 1]], was launched by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1957. Over time, a massive system of artificial satellites was placed into orbit around Earth. These satellites greatly advanced navigation, communications, military intelligence, geology, climate, and numerous other fields. Also, by the end of the 20th century, uncrewed probes had visited or flown by the Moon, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and various asteroids and comets, with [[Voyager 1]] being the farthest manufactured object from Earth at 23,5&nbsp;billion kilometers away from Earth as of 6 September 2022, and together with [[Voyager 2]] both carrying The [[Voyager Golden Record]] containing sounds, music and greetings in 55 languages as well as 116 images of nature, human advancement, space and society.\n* The [[Hubble Space Telescope]], launched in 1990, greatly expanded our understanding of the Universe and brought brilliant images to TV and computer screens around the world.\n* The [[Global Positioning System]], a series of satellites that allow land-based receivers to determine their exact location, was developed and deployed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/communications/policy/GPS_History.html|title= Global Positioning System History|date=2012-10-27|access-date=2018-02-07}}</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{see also|List of 20th-century religious leaders}}\n* 1900s – A number of related [[Pentecostalism#Early revivals: 1900–1929|revival movements]] mark the start of [[Pentecostalism]].\n* 1904 – [[Aleister Crowley]] dictates ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the foundational text of [[Thelema]].\n* 1922 – The [[Soviet Union]] establishes a doctrine of [[state atheism#Soviet Union|state atheism]].\n* 1924 – [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] abolishes the Islamic [[Caliphate]], in favor of [[secularism]].

In the middle of 20th century America, the leading cause of death was [[heart disease]] with 355.5 deaths per 100,000 followed by cancer at 139.8 deaths per 100,000. Although death rates dropped significantly in the latter part of the 20th century, the leading killers are still constant. The United States saw 192.9 people per 100,000 die from heart disease in 2010 followed by cancer with 185.9 people per 100,000.\n\nAn estimated 70 to 120 million people died from [[Famine#20th century|famine in the 20th century]], of whom over half died in China.  [[Malnutrition]] and [[hunger]] was also a leading cause of the global [[infant mortality]] and [[child mortality]].\n\nThe world population in the [[20th century]] experienced a large amount of death due to two major world wars. [[World War II]] was responsible for the most war related deaths in the 1900s with a death toll between 40,000,000 and 85,000,000 deaths. Other predominate wars in the 1900s include [[World War I]] with up to 22,000,000 deaths, the [[Russian Civil War]] with up to 9,000,000 deaths, the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan Civil War]] with up to 2,000,000 deaths, and the [[Mexican Revolution]] with up to 2,000,000 deaths. Several other major wars took place in the 20th century, such as the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], the [[second Sudanese civil war]], the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam war]].\n\nIt is estimated that [[traffic collision]]s caused the death of around 60 million people during the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visualnews.com/2013/03/19/visualizing-major-causes-of-death-in-the-20th-century/|title=Visualizing Major Causes of Death in the 20th Century|work=Visual News|access-date=20 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520222249/http://www.visualnews.com/2013/03/19/visualizing-major-causes-of-death-in-the-20th-century/|archive-date=20 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Ageing population==\n\nA natural population increase occurs when birth rates are higher than death rates. Recently and most notably, the years immediately after [[World War II]] saw an explosion in fertility rates called the [[Baby Boom]] because the returning soldiers and displaced people started new families. Death rates were significantly lower during the baby boom and thus populations increased substantially. Today these baby boomers are approaching old age and driving up the average age of the overall population. The World Bank predicts a dramatic decrease in population size from the increase in death rates over the next decade.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beyond Economic Growth|url=http://www.worldbank.org/depweb/english/beyond/beyondco/beg_03.pdf|work=World Population Growth|publisher=Worldbank}}</ref>\n\n[[Fertility rate]]s and consequently live birth rates declined over the century, while age-adjusted death rates fell more dramatically. Children in 1999 were 10 times less likely to die than children in 1900.\n\nFor adults 24–65, death rates have been halved. The death rate for Americans aged 65 to 74 fell from nearly 7% per year to fewer than 2% per year.\n\n==Improvements in public health==\n\nDuring the 20th century, an enormous improvement in public health led to an overall decrease in death rates. Infant mortality rates and maternal mortality rates have dramatically decreased. In the early 1900s, 6–9 women died in pregnancy-related complications for every 1,000 births, while 100 infants died before they were 1 year old. In 1999, at the end of the century, the infant mortality rate in the United States declined more than 90% to 7.2 deaths per 1,000 live births. Similarly, maternal mortality rates declined almost 99% to less than 0.1 reported deaths per 1,000 live births.\n\nThere are a variety of causes for this steep decline in death rates in the 20th century:\n* Environmental interventions\n* Improvement in nutrition\n* Advances in clinical medicine (sulfonamide in 1937, penicillin in the 1940s)\n* Improved access to health care\n* Improvements in surveillance and monitoring disease\n* Increases in education levels\n* Improvement in standards of living.\n\nDespite these tremendous decreases in infant mortality and maternal mortality, the 20th century experienced significant disparities between minority death rates compared to death rates for white mothers. In the 1900s, black women were twice as likely to die while giving birth compared to white women. Towards the end of the 20th century, black women are three times as likely to die while giving birth. This disparity is often cited as a lack in stronger [[Health care in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC|title=Achievements in Public Health, 1900–1999: Healthier Mothers and Babies|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4838a2.htm|access-date=13 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of countries by death rate]]\n* [[List of countries by life expectancy]]\n* [[Birth rate]]\n* [[Mortality rate]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://data.worldbank.org World Bank Open Data]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Death Rates In The 20th Century}}\n[[Category:20th-century deaths| ]]","_bytes":8049,"_xml:space":"preserve"},"timestamp":"2023-03-14T10:35:00Z"},"title":"Death rates in the 20th century","text":"","clean_content":"","extracted_details":{"stadiums":"[]","championship_wins":"[]","founding_dates":"[]","team_captains":"[]","famous_players":"[]","top_scorers":"[]","match_details":"[]"}}

The period also saw great population growth with increased birth rates and the emergence of the [[baby boomer]] generation.\nDespite this recovery, the [[Cold War]] developed from its modest beginnings in the late 1940s to a heated competition between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] by the early 1960s. The ideological clash between [[communism]] and [[capitalism]] dominated the decade, especially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].\n\nIn the United States, a wave of [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] sentiment known as the [[McCarthyism|Second Red Scare]] aka [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthyism]] resulted in Congressional hearings by both houses in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. In the Soviet Union, the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death]] of [[Joseph Stalin]] would lead to a political campaign and reforms known as \"[[de-Stalinization]]\" initiated by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] leading to the [[Sino-Soviet split|deterioration]] between the [[Sino-Soviet relations|relationship]] of the USSR and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in the 60s.\n\nThe beginning of the Cold War lead to beginning of the [[Space Race]] with the launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik&nbsp;1]] in 1957 and the United States would create [[NASA]] in response in 1958. Along with increased testing of [[nuclear weapon]]s (such as [[RDS-37]] and [[Operation Upshot–Knothole|Upshot–Knothole]]) called the [[Nuclear arms race|arms race]], the tense geopolitical situation created a politically conservative climate.\n\nThe beginning of [[decolonization]] in [[Decolonisation of Africa|Africa]] and [[Decolonisation of Asia|Asia]] also took place in this decade and accelerated in the following decade albeit would lead to several conflicts throughout the decade and so on. Wars include the [[First Indochina War]], [[Malayan Emergency]], [[Korean War]], the [[Algerian War]], the [[First Sudanese Civil War]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cuban Revolution]], and the [[Suez Crisis]]. Coups include the [[1952 Egyptian Revolution|Egyptian Revolution]], the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|Iranian coup d'état]], the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|Guatemalan coup d'état]], the [[14 July Revolution]] in [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], and the [[1958 Pakistani coup d'état|Pakistani coup d'état]] in 1958.\n\n[[Television]], which first reached the marketplace in the 1940s, became a common innovation in American homes during the 1950s culminating in the [[Golden Age of Television|Golden Age of TV]]. This led many to purchase more products and upgrade whatever they currently had resulting in mass [[consumerism]]. While outside of America, it would take a few decades for TV to become commonplace in other countries.\n\nThe 1950s saw a turning point for [[polio]] with the [[Announcement of polio vaccine success|successful discovery]] of the [[polio vaccine]]. Following the widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly in many [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] while it would gradually decline for the next few decades in [[Developing country|developing countries]] reducing the number of death rates from this disease.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the world population increased from 2.5 to 3.0 billion, with approximately 1 billion births and 500 million deaths. \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Politics and wars==\n{{See also|List of sovereign states in the 1950s}}\n[[File:Cold War Map 1959.png|thumb|750px|center|The world map of military alliances during the Cold War in 1959]]\n\n===Wars===\n{{Main|List of wars 1945–1989#1950–1959}}\n[[File:Koreanwarmontage.jpg|right|190px|thumb|[[Korean War]]]]\n* [[Cold War]] conflicts involving the influence of the rival superpowers of the Soviet Union and the United States\n** [[Korean War]] (1950–1953) – The war, which lasted from June 25, 1950, until the signing of the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] on July 27, 1953, started as a [[civil war]] between [[North Korea]] and the Republic of Korea ([[South Korea]]). When it began, North and South Korea existed as provisional governments competing for control over the Korean peninsula, due to the [[division of Korea]] by outside powers. While originally a civil war, it quickly escalated into a war between the Western powers under the [[United Nations Command]] led by the United States and its allies and the communist powers of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.{{paragraph}} On September 15, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] conducted [[Operation Chromite]], an amphibious landing at the city of Inchon (Song Do port). The North Korean army collapsed, and within a few days, MacArthur's army retook [[Seoul]] (South Korea's capital). He then pushed north, capturing Pyongyang in October. Chinese intervention the following month drove UN forces south again. MacArthur then planned for a full-scale invasion of China, but this was against the wishes of President Truman and others who wanted a limited war. He was dismissed and replaced by General Matthew Ridgeway. The war then became a bloody stalemate for the next two and a half years while peace negotiations dragged on.{{paragraph}} The war left 33,742 American soldiers dead, 92,134 wounded, and 80,000 missing in action (MIA) or [[prisoner of war]] (POW). Estimates place [[Korean War#Armistice (July 1953–November 1954)|Korean and Chinese casualties]] at 1,000,000–1,400,000 dead or wounded, and 140,000 MIA or POW.\n** [[First Indochina War]] (1946-1954).\n** The [[Vietnam War]] began in 1955. Diệm instituted a policy of death penalty against any communist activity in 1956. The [[Viet Minh]] began an assassination campaign in early 1957. An article by French scholar [[Bernard Fall]] published in July 1958 concluded that a new war had begun.

Following the nationalisation of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1956 by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], the United Kingdom, France and [[Israel]] subsequently invaded. The operation was a military success, but after the United States and Soviet Union united in opposition to the invasion, the invaders were forced to withdraw. This was seen as a major humiliation, especially for the two Western European countries, and symbolizes the beginning of the end of colonialism and the weakening of European global importance, specifically the collapse of the [[British Empire]].\n* [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962) – An important [[decolonization]] war, it was a complex conflict characterized by [[guerrilla warfare]], [[maquis (World War II)|maquis]] fighting, [[terrorism]] against civilians, use of torture on both sides and [[counter-terrorism]] operations by the [[French Army]]. The war eventually led to the independence of [[Algeria]] from France.\n\n===Internal conflicts===\n[[File:CheyFidel.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Che Guevara]] and [[Fidel Castro]].

This led to [[concentration camps]] in Kenya, a British military victory, and the election of moderate nationalist [[Jomo Kenyatta]] as leader of Kenya.\n* [[First Sudanese Civil War]] (1955–1972)\n* The [[wind of destruction]] began in Rwanda in 1959 following the assault of [[Hutu]] politician [[Dominique Mbonyumutwa]] by [[Tutsi]] forces. This was the beginning of decades of ethnic violence in the country, which culminated in the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].\n* [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] – A massive, spontaneous popular uprising in the Soviet [[satellite state]] of [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] against that country's Soviet-backed [[Marxist-Leninist]] regime, inspired by political changes in Poland and the Soviet Union.  The uprising, fought primarily by students and workers, managed to fight the invading Soviet Army to a standstill, and a new, pro-reform government took power.  While the top Soviet leaders even considered withdrawing from Hungary entirely, they soon crushed the Revolution with a massive second invasion, killing thousands of Hungarians and sending hundreds of thousands more into exile.  This was the largest act of internal dissent in the history of the [[Soviet Bloc]], and its violent suppression served to further discredit the Soviet Union even among its erstwhile supporters.\n* [[1951 Nepalese revolution]] – The overthrow of the autocratic [[Rana dynasty|Rana regime]] in Nepal and the establishment of democracy in [[Nepal]].\n\n===Coups===\n{{Main|List of coups d'état and coup attempts#1950–1959}}\n\nProminent [[coups d'état]] of the decade included:\n\n* [[1952 Egyptian Revolution]]: A group of army officers led by [[Mohammed Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] overthrew [[King of Egypt|King]] [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] and the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|Muhammad Ali Dynasty]] in July 1952.\n* On March 10, 1952, [[Fulgencio Batista]] led a bloodless [[1952 Cuban coup d'état|coup]] to topple the democratically elected government in [[Cuba]].\n* [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]]: In August 1953, a coup jointly led by the United States and United Kingdom and codenamed Operation Ajax, overthrew Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]].\n* [[1953 Pakistani constitutional coup]]: [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Ghulam Mohammad]], supported by Field Marshal [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]], dismissed the prime minister and dissolved the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan|Constituent Assembly]].\n* [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]]: The democratically elected government of Colonel [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]] was ousted by Colonel [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] in an operation organized by the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]].\n* The 1954 [[1954 Paraguayan coup d'état|Paraguayan coup]] brings [[Alfredo Stroessner]] to power.\n* [[14 July Revolution]] in Iraq: The [[Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemite monarchy]] was overthrown and the [[Iraqi Republic (1958–1968)|Iraqi Republic]] was established, with [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] as Prime Minister.\n* [[May 1958 crisis in France]]: General [[Jacques Massu]] took over [[Algiers]] and threatened to invade Paris unless [[Charles de Gaulle]] became head of state.\n* The [[1958 Pakistani coup d'état]]: The first [[President of Pakistan]] [[Iskander Mirza]] abrogated the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] and declared [[martial law]], and lasted until October 27, when Mirza himself was deposed by General [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]].\n\n[[File:Nepali Congress 1951.jpg|alt=Leading figures of the Nepali Congress and King Tribhuvan|thumb|Leading figures of the Nepali Congress and King Tribhuvan]]\n\n===Decolonization and independence===\n* [[Decolonization]] of former European [[colonial empire]]s. The [[French Fourth Republic]] in particular faced conflict on two fronts within the [[French Union]], the [[Algerian War]] and the [[First Indochina War]]. The [[Federation of Malaya]] peacefully gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957. [[French Algeria|French rule]] ended in [[Algeria]] in 1958, [[Vietnam]] left [[French Indo-china|French Indochina]] in 1954. The rival states of [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]] were formed. [[Cambodia under Sihanouk (1954–1970)|Cambodia]] and the [[Kingdom of Laos]] also gained independence, effectively ending French presence in Southeast Asia. Elsewhere, the [[Belgian Congo]] and other African nations gained their independence from France, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.\n* Large-scale decolonization in Africa first began in the 1950s. In 1951, [[Libya]] became the first African country to gain independence in the decade, and in 1954 the [[Algerian War]] began. 1956 saw [[Sudan]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]] become independent, and the next year [[Ghana]] became the first [[sub-saharan Africa]]n nation to gain independence.\n\n===Prominent political events===\n* [[European Common Market]] – The [[European Communities]] (or Common Markets), the precursor of the [[European Union]], was established with the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957.\n* On November 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican nationalists staged an [[Attempted assassination of Harry S. Truman|attempted assassination]] on U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]]. The leader of the team [[Griselio Torresola]] had firearm experience and [[Oscar Collazo]] was his accomplice. They made their assault at the [[Blair House]] where President Truman and his family were staying. Torresola mortally wounded a White House policeman, [[Leslie Coffelt]], who shot Torresola dead before expiring himself. Collazo, as a co-conspirator in a felony that turned into a homicide, was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death in 1952 but then his sentence was later commuted to life in prison.\n* On July 7, 1950, the first [[Group Areas Act]] was promulgated by the [[Parliament of South Africa]] and implemented over a period of several years. The passing of the Act contributed significantly to the period of institutionalised [[racial segregation]] and [[discrimination]] in [[South Africa]] known as [[Apartheid]], which lasted from 1948 to 1991. One of the most famous uses of the Group Areas Act was the destruction of [[Sophiatown]], a suburb of [[Johannesburg]], which began on the 9th of February 1955.\n* Establishment of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], through the [[Bandung Conference]] of 1955, consisting of [[Member states of the United Nations|nations]] not formally aligned with or against any [[Cold War|major power bloc]].\n\n[[File:Soviet empire 1960.png|thumb|The maximum territorial extent of countries in the world under [[Soviet Empire|Soviet]] [[Sphere of influence|influence]], after the [[Cuban Revolution]].]]\n\n====Asia====\n* The U.S. ended its occupation of Japan, which became fully independent. Japan held democratic elections and recovered economically.\n* Within a year of its establishment, the People's Republic of China had reclaimed Tibet and intervened in the Korean War, causing years of hostility and estrangement from the United States. Mao admired Stalin and rejected the changes in Moscow after Stalin's death in 1953, leading to growing tension with the Soviet Union.\n* In 1950–1953 France tried to contain a growing communist insurgency led by [[Ho Chi Minh]]. After their defeat in the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954 France granted independence to the nations of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]]. At the [[Geneva Conference of 1954]] France and the Communists agreed to divide Vietnam and hold elections in 1956. The U.S. and South Vietnam rejected the Geneva accords and the division became permanent.\n* The [[Chinese Civil War]], which had started officially in 1927 and continued until the [[Second World War]] had ended on May 7, 1950. It resulted in the previous incumbent government in China, the [[Republic of China]], retreating to the islands of Taiwan and [[Hainan]] until the [[Landing Operation on Hainan Island]].\n\n====Africa====\n* Africa experienced the beginning of large-scale top-down economic interventions in the 1950s that failed to cause improvement and led to charitable exhaustion by the [[Western world|West]] as the century went on. The widespread corruption was not dealt with and war, disease, and famine continued to be constant problems in the region.\n* Egyptian general [[Gamel Abdel Nasser]] overthrew the Egyptian monarchy, establishing himself as President of [[Egypt]]. Nasser became an influential leader in the Middle East in the 1950s, leading Arab states into war with [[Israel]], becoming a major leader of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and promoting [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab unification]].\n* In 1957, [[Kwame Nkrumah|Dr. Kwame Nkrumah]], after a series of negotiations with the then British empire, secured the independence of Ghana. Ghana was hitherto referred to as Gold Coast, a colony of the [[British Empire]].\n\n====Americas====\n[[File:Dwight D. Eisenhower, official photo portrait, May 29, 1959.jpg|thumb|Official portrait of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[president of the United States]] for a majority of the 1950s]]\n\n* In 1950, [[Colony of Greenland|Greenland]] (27 May) became a [[Danish colonial empire|Colony]] of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]. [[North Greenland]] and [[South Greenland]] were united with one [[list of governors of Greenland|governor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Greenland.html|title=Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat)|publisher=World Statesmen|language=en|access-date=30 June 2016}}</ref> \n* In 1953, [[County of Greenland|Greenland]] (5 June) was made an equal and integral part of [[Denmark]] as an [[amt]].\n* In 1954, the [[CIA]] [[Operation PBSUCCESS|orchestrated the overthrow of the Guatemalan government]] of [[Jacobo Arbenz]] and installed [[Carlos Castillo Armas]].\n* In 1956, the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] occurred against the policy of [[racial segregation]] on the public transit system of [[Montgomery, Alabama]], US. It was a foundational event in the [[civil rights movement]], sparked by activist [[Rosa Parks]], and officially ended when the federal ruling ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' took effect and led to a Supreme Court decision that declared the Alabama laws that segregated buses were unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis55.htm#1955mbb |title=Montgomery Bus Boycott |website=Civil Rights Movement Archive }}</ref>\n* In 1957, Dr. [[François Duvalier]] came to power in an election in [[Haiti]]. He later declared himself president for life, and ruled until his death in 1971.\n*In 1958, the military dictatorship of Venezuela was overthrown.\n* In 1959, [[Alaska]] (3 January) and [[Hawaii]] (21 August) became the 49th and 50th states respectively of the United States.\n* In 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] overthrew the regime of [[Fulgencio Batista]] in [[Cuba]], establishing a [[Communism|communist]] government in the country. Although Castro initially sought aid from the US, he was rebuffed and later turned to the Soviet Union.\n* [[NORAD]] signed in 1959 by Canada and the United States creating a unified North American air defense system.\n* [[Brasília]] was built in 41 months, from 1956, and on April 21, 1960, became the capital of Brazil\n\n====Europe====\n* With the help of the [[Marshall Plan]], post-war reconstruction succeeded, with some countries (including West Germany) adopting free market capitalism while others adopted Keynesian-policy welfare states. Europe continued to be divided into ''Western'' and ''Soviet bloc'' countries. The geographical point of this division came to be called the [[Iron Curtain]].\n* Because previous attempts for a unified state failed, Germany remained divided into two states: the capitalist [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the west and the socialist [[German Democratic Republic]] in the east. The Federal Republic identified itself as the legal successor to the [[Nazi Germany|fascist dictatorship]] and was obliged in paying war reparations. The GDR, however, denounced the fascist past completely and did not recognize itself as responsible for paying reparations on behalf of the Nazi regime. The GDR's more harsh attitude in suppressing [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and [[Russophobia|Russophobic]] sentiment lingering in the post-Nazi society resulted in increased emigration to the west.\n* While the United States military maintained its bases in western Europe, the Soviet Union maintained its bases in the east. In 1953, [[Joseph Stalin]], the leader of the Soviet Union, died. This led to the rise of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who denounced Stalin and pursued a more liberal domestic and foreign policy, stressing peaceful competition with the West rather than overt hostility. There were anti-Stalinist uprisings in East Germany and Poland in 1953 and Hungary in 1956.\n* The [[Coronation of Elizabeth II]] took place on June 2, 1953, months after the death of her father King [[George VI]]. [[Elizabeth II]] was crowned Queen of the [[United Kingdom]] and other [[Commonwealth realms]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] in [[London]] in a first ever televised broadcast.\n\n==Disasters==\n[[File:Watersnoodramp 1953.jpg|thumb|[[North Sea flood of 1953]]]]\n\n'''Natural:'''\n* On August 15, 1950, the 8.6 {{M|w|link=y}} [[1950 Assam–Tibet earthquake|Assam–Tibet earthquake]] shakes the region with a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of XI (''Extreme''), killing between 1,500 and 3,300 people.\n* On January 18, 1951, [[Mount Lamington]] erupted in [[Papua New Guinea]], killing 3,000 people.\n* On January 31, 1953, the [[North Sea flood of 1953]] killed 1,835 people in the southwestern Netherlands (especially [[Zeeland]]) and 307 in the United Kingdom<ref>{{Cite book|title=Agricultural Records|last=Stratton|first=J.

Eisenhower.\n\nInflation was moderate during the decade of the 1950s. The first few months had a deflationary hangover from the 1940s but the first full year ended with what looked like the beginnings of massive inflation with annual inflation rates ranging from 8% to 9% a year. By 1952 inflation subsided. 1954 and 1955 flirted with deflation again but the remainder of the decade had moderate inflation ranging from 1% to 3.7%.

He is considered as the leading figure of the [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]] movement of the 1950s.]]\n\n[[Popular music]] in the early 1950s was essentially a continuation of the crooner sound of the previous decade, with less emphasis on the jazz-influenced big band style and more emphasis on a conservative, operatic, symphonic style of music. [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Frankie Laine]], [[Patti Page]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Kay Starr]], [[Perry Como]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Georgia Gibbs]], [[Eddie Fisher]], [[Teresa Brewer]], [[Dinah Shore]], [[Kitty Kallen]], [[Joni James]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Julie London]], [[Toni Arden]], [[June Valli]], [[Doris Day]], [[Arthur Godfrey]], [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Nat King Cole]], and vocal groups like the [[Mills Brothers]], [[The Ink Spots]], [[The Four Lads]], [[The Four Aces]], [[The Chordettes]], [[The Fontane Sisters]], [[The Hilltoppers (band)|The Hilltoppers]] and the [[Ames Brothers]]. [[Jo Stafford]]'s \"You Belong To Me\" was the #1 song of 1952 on the Billboard Top 100 chart.\n\nThe middle of the decade saw a change in the popular music landscape as [[classic pop]] was swept off the charts by rock-and-roll. Crooners such as [[Eddie Fisher]], [[Perry Como]], and [[Patti Page]], who had dominated the first half of the decade, found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed by the decade's end.<ref>R. S. Denisoff, W. L. Schurk, ''Tarnished gold: the record industry revisited'' (Transaction Publishers, 3rd edn., 1986), p. 13.</ref>\n[[Doo-wop]] entered the pop charts in the 1950s. Its popularity soon spawns the parody \"[[Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)]]\".\n\n[[Rock-n-roll]] emerged in the mid-1950s with [[Little Richard]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Jackie Wilson]], [[Gene Vincent]], [[Fats Domino]], [[James Brown]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Bobby Darin]], [[Ritchie Valens]], [[Duane Eddy]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[Bobby Vee]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Neil Sedaka]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[Tommy Steele]], [[Billy Fury]], [[Marty Wilde]] and [[Cliff Richard]] being notable exponents. In the mid-1950s, [[Elvis Presley]] became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of [[rock and roll]] with a series of network television appearances and chart-topping records. [[Chuck Berry]], with \"[[Maybellene]]\" (1955), \"[[Roll Over Beethoven]]\" (1956), \"[[Rock and Roll Music (song)|Rock and Roll Music]]\" (1957) and \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\" (1958), refined and developed the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, focusing on teen life and introducing [[guitar solo]]s and [[Guitar showmanship|showmanship]] that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.<ref name=\"Campbell2008p168\">M. Campbell, ed., ''Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on'' (Cengage Learning, 3rd edn., 2008), pp. 168–9.</ref> [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]], Presley, [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Conway Twitty]], [[Johnny Horton]], and [[Marty Robbins]] were [[Rockabilly]] musicians. [[Doo-wop]] was another popular genre at the time. Popular Doo Wop and Rock-n-Roll bands of the mid to late 1950s include [[The Platters]], [[The Flamingos]], [[The Dells]], [[The Silhouettes]], [[Frankie Lymon]] and [[The Teenagers]], [[Little Anthony and The Imperials]], [[Danny & the Juniors]], [[The Coasters]], [[The Drifters]], [[The Del-Vikings]] and [[Dion and the Belmonts]].\n\n[[File:Harry Belafonte singing 1954.jpg|thumb|left|155px|[[Harry Belafonte]] in 1954, whose breakthrough album ''[[Calypso (album)|Calypso]]'' (1956) was the first million-selling LP by a single artist.]]\n\nThe new music differed from previous styles in that it was primarily targeted at the teenager market, which became a distinct entity for the first time in the 1950s as growing prosperity meant that young people did not have to grow up as quickly or be expected to support a family. Rock-and-roll proved to be a difficult phenomenon for older Americans to accept and there were widespread accusations of its being a communist-orchestrated scheme to corrupt the youth, although rock and roll was extremely market-based and capitalistic.\n\n[[Jazz]] stars in the 1950s who came into prominence in their genres called [[bebop]], [[hard bop]], [[cool jazz]] and the [[blues]], at this time included [[Lester Young]], [[Ben Webster]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Miles Davis]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Art Tatum]], [[Bill Evans]], [[Ahmad Jamal]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Gil Evans]], [[Jerry Mulligan]], [[Cannonball Adderley]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Chet Baker]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Art Blakey]], [[Max Roach]], the [[Miles Davis Quintet]], the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Dinah Washington]], [[Nina Simone]], and [[Billie Holiday]].\n\nThe [[American folk music revival]] became a phenomenon in the [[United States in the 1950s]] to mid-1960s with the initial success of [[The Weavers]] who popularized the genre. Their sound, and their broad repertoire of traditional folk material and [[topical song]]s inspired other groups such as [[the Kingston Trio]], the [[Chad Mitchell Trio]], [[The New Christy Minstrels]], and the \"collegiate folk\" groups such as [[The Brothers Four]], [[The Four Freshmen]], [[The Four Preps]], and [[The Highwaymen (folk band)|The Highwaymen]]. All featured tight vocal harmonies and a repertoire at least initially rooted in folk music and topical songs.\n\nOn 3 February 1959, a chartered plane transporting the three American [[rock and roll]] musicians [[Buddy Holly]], [[Ritchie Valens]] and [[The Big Bopper|J. P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson]] goes down in foggy conditions near [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], killing all four occupants on board, including pilot [[Roger Peterson (pilot)|Roger Peterson]]. The tragedy is later termed \"[[The Day the Music Died]]\", popularized in [[Don McLean]]'s 1971 song \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\". This event, combined with the conscription of Presley into the US Army, is often taken to mark the point where the era of 1950s rock-and-roll ended.\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Family watching television 1958.jpg|thumb|An American family watching television together in 1958.]]\n\nThe 1950s are known as the Golden Age of Television  by some people. Sales of TV sets rose tremendously in the 1950s and by 1950 4.4 million families in America had a television set. Americans devoted most of their free time to watching television broadcasts. People spent so much time watching TV, that movie attendance dropped and so did the number of radio listeners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kallen|first=Stuart|title=A Cultural History of the United States|year=1999|publisher=Lucent|location=San Diego}}</ref> Television revolutionized the way Americans see themselves and the world around them.

Thornhill in ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959)]]\n\n[[European cinema]] experienced a renaissance in the 1950s following the deprivations of World War II. Italian director [[Federico Fellini]] won the first [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|foreign language film]] [[Academy Award]] with ''[[La Strada]]'' and garnered another Academy Award with ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]''. [[Sidney Poitier]] became the first Black actor to receive an Academy Award nomination [[Academy Award for Best Actor|for Best Actor]] for the 1958 film ''[[The Defiant Ones]]'' (an award he later won in the 1960s).\n\nSimilarly with the mid 50s rush of [[Rock_and_roll|Rock and Roll]] & teenage rebellion, The movies of [[Marlon Brando]] & [[James Dean]] had a profound effect on American culture.\n\nIn [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], the epic ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' grabbed a record 11 [[Academy Awards]] in 1959 and its success gave a new lease of life to [[motion picture]] studio [[MGM]].\n\nBeginning in 1953, with ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' and ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'', [[widescreen]] motion pictures became the norm.\n\nThe \"Golden Era\" of [[3D film|3D cinematography]] transpired during the 1950s.\n\nAnimated films in the 1950s presented by Walt Disney included ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' and ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', followed by ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''.\n\n===Art movements===\nIn the early 1950s [[abstract expressionism]] and artists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] were enormously influential. However, by the late 1950s [[Color Field]] painting and [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]'s paintings became more in focus to the next generation.\n\n[[Pop art]] used the [[iconography]] of television, photography, comics, cinema and advertising. With its roots in [[dadaism]], it started to take form towards the end of the 1950s when some European artists started to make the symbols and products of the world of [[advertising]] and [[propaganda]] the main subject of their artistic work. This return of [[figurative art]], in opposition to the abstract expressionism that dominated the aesthetic scene since the end of World War II was dominated by Great Britain until the early 1960s when [[Andy Warhol]], the most known artist of this movement began to show Pop Art in galleries in the United States.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{See also|1945–60 in Western fashion}}\n[[Image:Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell at Chinese Theater.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Jane Russell]] in 1953, showing American fashions and popular hairstyles of the era]]\n[[File:Elizabeth Taylor, late 1950s.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Liz Taylor]] in the 1950s, a fashion icon of the era]]\n\nThe 1950s saw the birth of the [[teenager]] and with it [[rock n roll]] and youth fashion dominating the fashion industry. In the UK the [[Teddy boy]] became both style icons and anti-authoritarian figures. While in America [[Greaser (subculture)|Greaser]]s had a similar social position. Previously teenagers dressed similarly to their parents but now a rebellious and different youth style was being developed. This was particularly noticeable in the overtly sexual nature of their dress. Men wore tight trousers, leather jackets and emphasis was on slicked, greasy hair.\n\nNew ideas meant new designers who had a concept of what was fashion. Fashion started gaining a voice and style when Christian Dior created “[[The New Look (style)|The New Look]]” collection. The 1950s was not only about spending on luxurious brands but also the idea of being comfortable was created. It was a time where resources were available and it was a new type of fashion. Designers were creating collections with different materials such as: taffeta, nylon, rayon, wool and leather that allowed different colors and patterns. People started wearing artificial fibers because it was easier to take care of and it was price effective.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fashion-era.com/1950s_glamour.htm|title=1950s Fashion History 50s Glamour, Dior New Look|last=Thomas|first=Pauline|website=www.fashion-era.com|access-date=2016-10-31}}</ref> It was a time where shopping was part of a lifestyle.\n\nDifferent designers emerged or made a comeback on the 1950s because as mention before it was a time for fashion and ideas. The most important designers from the time were:\n\n'''[[Christian Dior]]:''' everything started in 1947 after World War II was over. Christian Dior found that there were a lot of resources in the market. He created the famous and inspirational collection named [[The New Look (style)|“The New Look.”]] This consisted on the idea of creating voluminous dresses that would not only represent wealth but also show power on women. This collection was the first collection to use 80 yards of fabric.<ref name=\":0\" /> He introduced the idea of the hourglass shape for women; wide shoulders, tight waistline and then voluminous full skirts. Dior was a revolutionary and he was the major influence for the next collections. He is known for always developing new ideas and designs, which led to a rapid expansion and becoming worldwide known.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Fashion: A Visual History from Regency & Romance to Retro & Revolution: A Complete Illustrated Chronology of Fashion from the 1800s to the Present Day.|last=Stevenson|first=N.

He not only made the hourglass shape very famous but he also developed the H-line as well as the A and Y-Lines.

Marquesa de Casa Torre helped Balenciaga enter the world of couture.<ref name=\":1\" /> His first suit was very dramatic. The suit consisted on cutout and cut-ins the waist over a slim skirt, something not seen before.<ref name=\":1\" /> Balenciaga was a revolutionary designer who was not afraid to cut and let loose because he had everything under control. In the 1950s and 1960s his designs were well known for attention to color and texture. He was creating different silhouettes for women, in 1955 he created the tunic, 1957 the sack dress and 1958 the Empire styles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/fashion-clothing-industry/fashion-designers/cristobal-balenciaga|title=Cristóbal Balenciaga|newspaper=LoveToKnow|access-date=2016-10-31}}</ref> He was known for moving from tailored designs to shapeless allowing him to show portion and balance on the bodies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Showing that his designs evolved with time and maintained his ideologies.\n\n'''[[Coco Chanel]]:''' Her style was well known over the world and her idea of having functional luxurious clothing influenced other designers from the era. Chanel believed that luxurious should come from being comfortable that is why her designers were so unique and different from the time period, she also achieved her looks by adding accessories such as pearl necklaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/coco-chanel-9244165#!|title=Coco Chanel Biography|date=August 12, 2016|website=Biography.com}}</ref> Chanel believed that even though Dior designs were revolutionary for the time period they did not managed to represent the women of the time.

The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and [[food prices]] at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the [[subprime mortgage crisis|crisis in housing and credit]] in the United States in late 2007 and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions.

[[Myspace]] was the most popular social networking website until June 2009, when Facebook overtook it in number of American users. [[Email]] continued to be popular throughout the decade and began to replace \"[[Mail|snail mail]]\" as the primary way of sending letters and other messages to people in distant locations. [[Google]], [[YouTube]], [[Ask.com]] and [[Wikipedia]] emerged to become among the top 10 most popular websites. [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] overtook [[eBay]] as the most-visited e-commerce site in 2008. [[AOL]] significantly declined in popularity throughout the decade, falling from being the most popular website to no longer being within the top 10. [[Excite (web portal)|Excite]] and [[Lycos]] fell outside the top 10, and [[MSN]] fell from the second to sixth most popular site, though it quadrupled its monthly visits.

[[Al-Qaeda]] and affiliated [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. The [[Second Congo War]], the deadliest conflict since World War II, ended in July 2003. Further wars that ended included the [[Algerian Civil War]], the [[Angolan Civil War]], the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]], the [[Second Liberian Civil War]], the [[Nepalese Civil War]], and the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]].

The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) announced that the 2000s may have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 having occurred in this decade. The WMO's findings were later echoed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]].

Beginning in 1964, the [[FARC]] and [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] narcoterrorist groups were taking control of rural areas of the country by the beginning of the decade, while terrorist paramilitaries grew in other places as businesspeople and politicians thought the State would lose the war against guerrillas. However, after the failure of the peace process and the activation of [[Plan Colombia]], [[Álvaro Uribe Vélez]] was elected president in 2002, starting a massive attack on terrorist groups, with cooperation from civil population, foreign aid and legal armed forces. The [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]] paramilitary organization disbanded in 2006, while ELN guerrillas have been weakened. The [[Popular Liberation Army]] demobilized while the country's biggest terrorist group, [[FARC]] has been weakened and most of their top commanders have been killed or died during the decade. During the second half of the decade, a new criminal band has been formed by former members of AUC who did not demobilize, calling themselves [[Aguilas Negras]]. Although the Colombian State has taken back control over most of the country, narcoterrorism still causes pain in the country. Since 2008, the Internet has become a new field of battle. Facebook has gained nationwide popularity and has become the birthplace of many civil movements against narcoterrorism such as \"Colombia Soy Yo\" (I am Colombia) or \"Fundación Un Millón de Voces\" (One Million Voices Foundation), responsible for the international protests against illegal groups during the last years.\n* The [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] (1991–2002) came to an end when the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) finally laid down their arms.

The hollowing out of manufacturing was felt in Japan and parts of the United States and Europe which had not been able to develop successful innovative industries. Opponents point out that the practice of offshore outsourcing by countries with higher wages leads to the reduction of their own domestic employment and domestic investment.

The Internet also allowed more artists to distribute music relatively inexpensively and independently without the previously necessary financial support of a record label. Music sales began to decline following the year 2000, a state of affairs generally attributed to unlicensed uploading and downloading of sound files to the Internet, a practice which became more widely prevalent during this time. Business relationships called [[360 deal]]s—an arrangement in which a company provides support for an artist, and, in exchange, the artist pays the company a percentage of revenue earned not only from sales of recorded music, but also live performances and publishing—became a popular response by record labels to the loss of music sales attributed to online copyright infringement.<ref name=\"usatoday.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-12-29-musicdecade29_CV_N.htm| work=USA Today| title=The decade in music: Sales slide, pirates, digital rise| date=December 30, 2009| access-date=December 23, 2011| first1=Edna| last1=Gundersen}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/arts/music/new-pop-music-sounds-like-its-predecessors.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all| work=The New York Times| title=The Songs of Now Sound a Lot Like Then| date=July 15, 2011| access-date=December 2, 2011| first1=Simon| last1=Reyonolds| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614122202/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/arts/music/new-pop-music-sounds-like-its-predecessors.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all| archive-date=June 14, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] reached a commercial peak and heavily influenced various aspects of popular culture, dominating the musical landscape of the decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=boyd/040818|first=Todd|last=Boyd|title=They're playing bas-ket-ball|work=ESPN|date=August 19, 2004|access-date=February 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927203643/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=boyd%2F040818|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2009/11/myth-no-4-biggie-tupac-are-hip-hops-pillars/| website=Spin| title=MYTH No. 4: Biggie & Tupac Are Hip-Hop's Pillars|date=November 9, 2009|access-date=September 4, 2011| first1=Jon| last1=Caramanica|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207075950/https://www.spin.com/2009/11/myth-no-4-biggie-tupac-are-hip-hops-pillars//|archive-date=December 7, 2013 }}</ref> The best-selling musical artist of the decade was American [[rapping|rapper]] [[Eminem]], who sold 32 million albums.

Pictured with [[Ryan Lochte]] (left) and [[László Cseh]] (right)]]\nThe Sydney [[2000 Summer Olympics]], followed the centennial anniversary of the modern era Olympic Games, held in Atlanta in 1996. The Athens [[2004 Summer Olympics]], were a strong symbol, for modern Olympic Games were inspired by the competitions organized in [[Ancient Greece]]. Finally, the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Games]] saw the emergence of China as a major sports power, with the highest number of titles for the first time. The [[2002 Winter Games|2002 Salt Lake City]] and the [[2006 Winter Games|2006 Turin]] Winter Olympic Games were also major events, though slightly less popular.\n\nAssociation football's important events included two World Cups, one organized in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|South Korea and Japan]], which saw Brazil win a record fifth title, and the other in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|Germany]], which saw Italy win its fourth title. The regional competitions, the [[Copa América]] and [[UEFA European Championship]], saw five nations rising the cup: Colombia (2001) and Brazil (2004, 2007) won the Copa América, while France (2000), Greece (2004) and Spain (2008) won the European Championship.\n\nIn 2001, after the [[9/11 attacks]], both the [[National Football League]] and [[Major League Baseball]] canceled their upcoming games for a week. As a result, the [[2001 World Series|World Series]] would be played in November for the first time and the [[Super Bowl XXXVI|Super Bowl]] would be played in February for the first time.\n\nThe expansion and rise of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) occurred after the airing of [[The Ultimate Fighter]] in 2005.\n\n[[Rugby football|Rugby]] increased in size and audience, as the [[Rugby World Cup]] became the third most watched sporting event in the world with the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] organized in France.\n\n[[Bloodgate]] is the nickname for a rugby union scandal involving the English team Harlequins in their Heineken Cup match against the Irish side Leinster on April 12, 2009. It was so called because of the use of fake blood capsules, and has been seen by some as one of the biggest scandals in rugby since professionalisation in the mid-1990s, indeed even as an argument against the professional ethos. The name is a pun on Watergate.\n\nThe [[New York Yankees]] won the first [[Major League Baseball]] [[World Series]] of the decade in 2000, as well as the last World Series of the decade in 2009. The [[Boston Red Sox]] won their first [[World Series]] since 1918 in 2004 and then again in 2007.\n\nThe [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] won a record sixth Super Bowl on February 1, 2009, against the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. Pittsburgh's Super Bowl win would remain the championship record for an NFL franchise until [[Super Bowl LIII|a decade later]] when the [[New England Patriots]] defeated the [[Los Angeles Rams]] to tie the Super Bowl championship record.\n\n'''Athletes'''\n\nOne of the most prominent events of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] held in Beijing was the achievement of [[Michael Phelps]] the American swimmer, frequently cited as the greatest swimmer and one of the greatest Olympians of all time.<ref>{{cite news|title=5 things we learned about Michael Phelps|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/swimming/news/newsid=229303.html|first=Pamela|last=Barone|date=August 17, 2008|access-date=July 30, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103052144/http://www.nbcolympics.com/swimming/news/newsid%3D229303.html|archive-date=November 3, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Phelps officially world's greatest athlete ever|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26194188|work=[[NBC News]]|first=Mike|last=Celizic|date=August 16, 2008|access-date=July 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=It's over, there are no arguments ...

[[Lance Armstrong]] won all the [[Tour de France]] between 1999 and 2005, also an all-time record, but was later stripped of all his titles when evidence emerged of his use of performance-enhancing drugs. Swiss tennis player [[Roger Federer]] won 16 [[Grand Slam title]]s to become the most titled player.\n\nThe decade saw the continued rise of several of the most notable and popular [[quarterbacks]] in [[NFL]] history, including [[Peyton Manning]], [[Tom Brady]], [[Brett Favre]], [[Drew Brees]], [[Ben Roethlisberger]], [[Donovan McNabb]], [[Kurt Warner]], [[Eli Manning]], [[Steve McNair]], [[Tony Romo]] and others.\n\n'''Timeline of sporting events'''\n\nIn May 2004, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] became the only top-tier team to go through an entire league season (2003/4) unbeaten when they won the English Premier League and became 'The Invincibles'. This feat had also been achieved in the 19th century, when the league was in its infancy and there were far fewer matches in a season, but not in the modern era. Arsenal's unbeaten run extended to 49 matches in total, and into the subsequent season.\n\nIn September 2004, [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] footballer [[Adrian Mutu]] failed a drugs test for cocaine and was released on October 29, 2004. He also received a seven-month ban and a £20,000 fine from [[The Football Association]].\n\nThe [[2006 Italian football scandal]], also known as \"''Calciopoli''\", involved Italy's top professional football leagues, [[Serie A]] and [[Serie B]]. The scandal was uncovered in May 2006 by Italian police, implicating league champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], and other major teams including [[A.C. Milan]], [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and [[Reggina 1914|Reggina]] when a number of telephone interceptions showed a thick network of relations between team managers and referee organisations. Juventus were the champions of Serie A at the time. The teams have been accused of rigging games by selecting favourable referees.\n\nThe [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final]] in Berlin, [[Zinedine Zidane]] widely considered by experts and fans as one of the greatest football players of all time, was sent off in the 110th minute of the game, which was to be the last match of his career. After headbutting [[Marco Materazzi]] in the chest, Zidane did not participate in the penalty shootout, which Italy won 5–3. It was later discovered through interviews that Materazzi had insulted Zidane's mother and sister that last moment which is what led to Zidane's heightened anger and reaction.\n\nJanuary 11, 2007 – When English footballer [[David Beckham]] joined the [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]], he was given the highest player salary in the league's history; with his playing

In a 2008 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article entitled \"Why Nobody's Boycotting Beijing\", Vivienne Walt wrote:\n'Leaders in power are more mindful of China's colossal clout in an increasingly shaky world economy, and therefore of the importance of keeping good relations with its government.'<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Walt |first=Vivienne |date=July 16, 2008 |title=Why Nobody's Boycotting Beijing |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1823561,00.html |magazine=Time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822212632/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1823561%2C00.html |archive-date=August 22, 2013 |access-date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Ron Atkinson]], is an English former football player and manager.

The consequences of the war lingered well into the second half of the decade, with a war-weary Europe divided between the jostling [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]] of the [[Western world]] and the [[Soviet Union]], leading to the beginning of the [[Cold War]]. To some degree internal and external tensions in the [[post-war]] era were managed by new institutions, including the [[United Nations]], the [[welfare state]], and the [[Bretton Woods system]], facilitating the [[post–World War II economic expansion]], which lasted well into the 1970s. The conditions of the post-war world encouraged [[decolonization]] and the emergence of new states and governments, with [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Israel]], [[Vietnam]], and others declaring independence, although rarely without bloodshed. The decade also witnessed the early beginnings of new technologies (such as [[computer]]s, [[nuclear power]], and [[jet engine|jet propulsion]]), often first developed in tandem with the war effort, and later adapted and improved upon in the post-war era.\n\nThe world population increased from about 2.25 to 2.5 billion over the course of the decade, with about 850 million births and 600 million deaths in total.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Politics and wars==\n{{See also|List of sovereign states in the 1940s}}\n[[File:Flag-map of the world (1942).png|thumb|750px|center|Flag map of the world from 1942, during World War II]]\n\n=== Wars ===\n{{Main|List of wars 1900–1944#1930–1944|List of wars 1945–1989#1945–1949}}\n[[File:EasternFrontWWIIcolage.png|right|thumb|250px|[[World War II]]]]\n[[File:German Reich 1942.svg|220px|thumb|In Green: {{flag|Nazi Germany|name=German Reich}} at its peak (1942):\n{{legend|#336733|[[:en:Nazi Germany|Germany]]}}\n{{legend|#55c255|Civilian-administered occupied territories ''([[:en:Reichskommissariat|Reichskommissariat]]'' and [[:en:General Government|General Government]])}}\n{{legend|#a5dfa5|Military-administered occupied territories ''([[:en:Military Administration (Nazi Germany)|Militärverwaltung]])''}}]]\n* [[World War II]] (1939–1945)\n** [[Nazi Germany]] invades [[Poland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Benelux]], and the [[French Third Republic]] from 1939 to 1941.\n** [[Soviet Union]] invades [[Poland]], [[Finland]], occupies [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]] and Romanian region of [[Bessarabia]] from 1939 to 1941.\n** Germany faces the [[United Kingdom]] in the [[Battle of Britain]] (1940).

The idea of function seemed to overtake fashion, if only for a few short months until the end of the war. Fabrics shifted dramatically as rationing and wartime shortages controlled import items such as silk and furs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} Floral prints dominated the early 1940s, with the mid-to-late 1940s also seeing what is sometimes referred to as \"atomic prints\" or geometric patterns and shapes.
