Bush was seen as the early favorite for the [[2000 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican nomination]], and after a contentious primary battle with [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John McCain]] and others, secured the nomination by [[Super Tuesday]]. Bush chose former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] as his [[running mate]], while Gore chose [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Joe Lieberman]].\n\nBoth major-party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal [[social insurance]] programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Due to President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal|sex scandal]] with [[Monica Lewinsky]] and subsequent [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]], Gore avoided campaigning with Clinton. Republicans denounced Clinton's indiscretions, while Gore criticized Bush's lack of experience. On election night, it was unclear who had won, with the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] of the state of [[Florida]] still undecided. The returns showed that Bush had won Florida by such a close margin that state law required a [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|recount]]. A month-long series of legal battles led to the highly controversial 5–4 [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', which ended the recount.\n\nThe recount having been ended, Bush won Florida by 537 votes, a margin of 0.009%. The Florida recount and subsequent litigation resulted in major post-election controversy, and with speculative analysis suggesting that limited county-based recounts would likely have confirmed a Bush victory, whereas a statewide recount would likely have given the state to Gore.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The American Statistician|date=February 2003|volume=57|number=1|pages=1–14|publisher=American Statistical Association|doi=10.1198/0003130031144|title=Statistical Practice: Reliability of the Uncertified Ballots in the 2000 Presidential Election in Florida|first1=Kirk|last1=Wolter|first2=Diana|last2=Jergovic|first3=Whitney|last3=Moore|first4=Joe|last4=Murphy|first5=Colm|last5=O'Muircheartaigh|url=http://www.amstat.org/misc/PresidentialElectionBallots.pdf|jstor=3087271|s2cid=120778921|access-date=June 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318154912/http://www.amstat.org/misc/PresidentialElectionBallots.pdf|archive-date=March 18, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"battle\"/> Ultimately, Bush won 271 electoral votes, one vote more than the 270-to-win majority, despite Gore receiving 543,895 more votes (a margin of 0.52% of all votes cast).<ref name=el2000>{{cite web|title=Federal Elections 2000: 2000 Presidential Electoral and Popular Vote Table|url=https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/elecpop.htm|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|access-date=March 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709174557/https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/elecpop.htm|archive-date=July 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Bush flipped 11 states that had voted Democratic in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]]: [[2000 United States presidential election in Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Arizona|Arizona]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Kentucky|Kentucky]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Louisiana|Louisiana]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Missouri|Missouri]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Nevada|Nevada]], [[2000 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Ohio|Ohio]], [[2000 United States presidential election in Tennessee|Tennessee]] and [[2000 United States presidential election in West Virginia|West Virginia]].

His second term expired at noon on January 20, 2001.]]\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two]] of the [[Constitution of the United States|United States Constitution]] dictates that the President and Vice President of the United States must be [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizens]] of the United States, at least 35 years old, and residents of the United States for a period of at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties, in which case each party devises a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Traditionally, the primary elections are [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president.\n\nPresident [[Bill Clinton]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and former [[List of governors of Arkansas|Governor of Arkansas]], was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]]; in accordance with Section{{nbsp}}1 of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], his term expired at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] on January 20, 2001.\n\n==Republican Party nomination==\n{{Main article|George W.

Bush took the majority of the remaining contests and won the Republican nomination on March 14, winning his home state of Texas and his brother [[Jeb Bush|Jeb's]] home state of Florida, among others. At the [[2000 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Philadelphia, Bush accepted the nomination.\n\nBush asked former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] to head up a team to help select a running mate for him, but ultimately chose Cheney himself as the vice presidential nominee. While the U.S. Constitution does not specifically disallow a president and a vice president from the same state, it prohibits electors from casting both of their votes for persons from their own state. Accordingly, Cheney—who had been a resident of [[Texas]] for nearly 10 years—changed his voting registration back to Wyoming. Had Cheney not done this, either he or Bush would have forfeited his electoral votes from Texas.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cheney changes voter registration, boosts Bush running mate chances|website=[[Deseret News]]|date=July 22, 2000|url=https://www.deseret.com/2000/7/22/19519524/cheney-changes-voter-registration-boosts-bush-running-mate-chances|access-date=November 18, 2023}}</ref>\n\n;Delegate totals\n*Governor George W.

While former basketball star [[Michael Jordan]] campaigned for him in the early primary states, Bradley announced his intention to campaign \"in a different way\" by conducting a positive campaign of \"big ideas.\" His campaign's focus was a plan to spend the record-breaking budget surplus on a variety of social welfare programs to help the poor and the middle class, along with campaign finance reform and [[gun control]].\n\nGore easily defeated Bradley in the primaries, largely because of support from the Democratic Party establishment and Bradley's poor showing in the Iowa caucus, where Gore successfully painted Bradley as aloof and indifferent to the plight of farmers. The closest Bradley came to a victory was his 50–46 loss to Gore in the New Hampshire primary.

Gore balanced Bush by sweeping the [[Northeastern United States]] (with the exception of [[New Hampshire]], which Bush won narrowly), the Pacific Coast states, [[Hawaii]], [[New Mexico]], and most of the [[Upper Midwest]].\n\nAs the night wore on, the returns in a handful of small-to-medium-sized states, including [[Wisconsin]], [[Iowa]], [[Oregon]] and New Mexico (Gore by 355 votes) were extremely close, but the election came down to Florida. As the final national results were tallied the following morning, Bush had clearly won 246 electoral votes and Gore 250, with 270 needed to win. Two smaller states—Wisconsin (11 electoral votes) and Oregon (7)—were still too close to call, but Florida's 25 electoral votes would be decisive regardless of their results. The election's outcome was not known for more than a month after voting ended because of the time required to count and recount Florida's ballots.\n\n===Florida recount===\n{{Main|2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida}}\n[[File:TallahaseePalmBeachBallotBox1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|2000 Palm Beach County voting stand and ballot box]]\nBetween 7:50&nbsp;p.m. and 8:00&nbsp;p.m. EST on November 7, just before the polls closed in the largely Republican Florida panhandle, which is in the Central time zone, all major television news networks ([[CNN]], [[NBC]], [[Fox News|FOX]], [[CBS]], and [[ABC News|ABC]]) declared that Gore had won Florida. They based this prediction substantially on [[exit poll]]s. But in the vote, Bush began to take a wide lead early in Florida, and by 10 p.m. EST, the networks had retracted their predictions and placed Florida back in the \"undecided\" column. At approximately 2:30&nbsp;a.m. on November 8, with 85% of the vote counted in Florida and Bush leading Gore by more than 100,000 votes, the networks declared that Bush had carried Florida and therefore been elected president. But most of the remaining votes to be counted in Florida were in three heavily Democratic counties—[[Broward County, Florida|Broward]], [[Miami-Dade County|Miami-Dade]], and [[Palm Beach County|Palm Beach]]—and as their votes were reported Gore began to gain on Bush. By 4:30&nbsp;a.m., after all votes were counted, Gore had narrowed Bush's margin to under 2,000 votes, and the networks retracted their declarations that Bush had won Florida and the presidency. Gore, who had privately conceded the election to Bush, withdrew his [[Concession (politics)|concession]]. The final result in Florida was slim enough to require a mandatory recount (by machine) under state law; Bush's lead dwindled to just over 300 votes when it was completed the day after the election. On November 8, Florida Division of Elections staff prepared a press release for [[Florida Secretary of State]] [[Katherine Harris]] that said overseas ballots must be \"postmarked or signed and dated\" by Election Day. It was never released.<ref name=\"battle\"/>{{rp|16}} A count of the overseas ballots later boosted Bush's margin to 930 votes. (According to a report by ''The New York Times'', 680 of the accepted overseas ballots were received after the legal deadline, lacked required postmarks or a witness signature or address, or were unsigned or undated, cast after election day, from unregistered voters or voters not requesting ballots, or double-counted.<ref name=\"NYT07152001\">{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html|title=Examining the Vote; How Bush Took Florida: Mining the Overseas Absentee Vote|first1=David|last1=Barstow|first2=Don Jr. |last2=Van Natta|date=July 15, 2001|access-date=November 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115173828/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html|archive-date=November 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>)\n[[File:1116c6 (5124003635).jpg|thumb|right|Florida Supreme Court during the recount]]\nMost of the post-electoral controversy revolved around Gore's request for hand recounts in four counties (Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia]]), as provided under Florida state law. Harris, who also co-chaired Bush's Florida campaign, announced she would reject any revised totals from those counties if they were not turned in by 5&nbsp;p.m. on November 14, the statutory deadline for amended returns. The [[Florida Supreme Court]] extended the deadline to November 26, a decision later [[vacated]] by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. Miami-Dade eventually halted its recount and resubmitted its original total to the state canvassing board, while Palm Beach County failed to meet the extended deadline, turning in its completed recount results at 7&nbsp;p.m., which Harris rejected. On November 26, the state canvassing board certified Bush as the winner of Florida's electors by 537 votes. Gore formally contested the certified results. A state court decision overruling Gore was reversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered a recount of over 70,000 ballots previously rejected as undervotes by machine counters. The U.S. Supreme Court halted that order the next day, with [[Justice Scalia]] issuing a concurring opinion that \"the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner\" (Bush).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://election2000.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/00-949x.pdf\n|title=SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.

He was also the first son of a former president to be elected president himself since [[John Quincy Adams]] in 1824.\n\nBush was the first Republican in American history to win the presidency without carrying Vermont, Illinois, or New Mexico, as well as the second Republican to win the presidency without carrying California after [[James A. Garfield]] in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]], and Pennsylvania, Maine, and Michigan after [[Richard Nixon]] in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], as well as the first winning Republican not to receive any electoral votes from California as Garfield received one electoral vote in 1880. Bush was the first Republican to win without New Jersey, Delaware, or Connecticut since 1888. As of 2020, Bush is the last Republican nominee to win New Hampshire. No state in the Northeast has voted Republican since except for Pennsylvania in 2016. This marked the first time since Iowa entered the union in 1846 in which the state voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in four elections in a row and the last time until 2020 that Iowa did not vote for the overall winner. This election was the first time since 1976 that New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont, Maine, Illinois, New Mexico, Michigan, and California voted for the losing candidate, as well as the first since 1980 that Maryland did so, the first since 1948 that Delaware did so, and the first since 1968 that Pennsylvania did so.\n\nThere were two counties in the nation that had voted Republican in [[United States Presidential Election, 1996|1996]] and voted Democratic in 2000: [[Charles County, Maryland]], and [[Orange County, Florida]], both rapidly diversifying counties.<ref>{{cite web|title = The 2016 Streak Breakers|publisher = Sabato Crystal Ball|access-date = 2017-09-15|url = http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-2016-streak-breakers/}}</ref> The 2000 election was also the last time a Republican won a number of populous urban counties that have since turned into Democratic strongholds.

Many of Florida's 2000 election night problems stemmed from [[usability]] and ballot design factors with voting systems, including the potentially confusing \"[[butterfly ballot]].\" Many voters had difficulties with the paper-based [[voting machine#Punch card|punch card]] voting machines and were either unable to understand the voting process or unable to perform it. This resulted in an unusual number of [[overvote]]s (voting for more candidates than is allowed) and [[undervote]]s (voting for fewer than the minimum candidates, including none at all). Many undervotes were caused by voter error, unmaintained punch card voting booths, or errors having to do merely with the characteristics of punch card ballots (resulting in hanging, dimpled, or pregnant [[Chad (paper)|chads]]).\n\nA proposed solution to these problems was the installation of modern [[electronic voting]] machines. The 2000 presidential election spurred the debate about election and voting reform but did not end it.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA) was passed to help states upgrade their election technology in the hopes of preventing similar problems in future elections. But the electronic voting systems that many states purchased to comply with HAVA actually caused problems in the 2004 presidential election.<ref>Freeman, Steven & Bleifuss, Joel.

She was captured by the [[Royal Navy]] on 9 May 1941 and provided a number of secret cipher documents to the British. ''U-110''{{'}}s capture, later given the code name \"Operation Primrose\", was one of the biggest secrets of the war, remaining so for seven months. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was only told of the capture by [[Winston Churchill]] in January 1942.\n\n==Design==\n[[German Type IXB submarine]]s were slightly larger than the original [[German Type IXA submarine|German Type IX submarines]], later designated IXA. ''U-110'' had a displacement of {{convert|1051|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|1178|t|LT}} while submerged.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}} The U-boat had a total length of {{convert|76.50|m|ftin|abbr=on|0}}, a [[pressure hull]] length of {{convert|58.75|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.76|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a height of {{convert|9.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|4.70|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The submarine was powered by two [[MAN SE|MAN]] M 9 V 40/46 [[supercharged]] four-stroke, nine-cylinder [[diesel engine]]s producing a total of {{convert|4400|PS|kW shp|-1}} for use while surfaced, two [[Siemens-Schuckert]] 2 GU 345/34 [[Motor–generator|double-acting electric motors]] producing a total of {{convert|1000|PS|kW shp|-1}} for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two {{convert|1.92|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[propeller]]s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to {{convert|230|m}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}}\n\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|18.2|kn}} and a maximum submerged speed of {{convert|7.3|kn}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}} When submerged, the boat could operate for {{convert|64|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|12000|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}. ''U-110'' was fitted with six {{convert|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 [[torpedo]]es, one [[10.5&nbsp;cm SK C/32 naval gun|{{convert|10.5|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} SK C/32 naval gun]], 180 rounds, and a [[3.7&nbsp;cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} SK C/30]] as well as a [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} C/30]] anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a [[Ship's company|complement]] of forty-eight.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|p=68}}\n\n==Service history==\n\n''U-110''{{'}}s keel was laid down 1 February 1940 by [[DeSchiMAG]] [[AG Weser]], of [[Bremen]], Germany as yard number 973. She was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 25 August 1940 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 21 November with ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' [[Fritz-Julius Lemp]] in command.\n\nThe boat was part of the [[2nd U-boat Flotilla]] from her commissioning date until her loss. Lemp commanded ''U-110'' for her entire career. In an earlier boat ({{GS|U-30|1936|2}}), he was responsible for the sinking of the passenger liner [[SS Athenia (1922)|''SS Athenia'']] on the first day of the war. The circumstances were such that he was considered for [[court-martial]]. He continued, however, to be one of the most successful and rebellious commanders of his day.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLnEK-kBcQEC&pg=PT81|first=Hugh|last=Sebag-Montefiore|title=Enigma: The Battle for the Code|publisher=Hachette UK|year=2011|isbn=9781780221236|chapter=13 – Operation Primrose}}</ref>\n\n==Operational career==\n\n===First patrol===\n''U-110'' set out on her first patrol from [[Kiel]] on 9 March 1941. Her route to the Atlantic Ocean took her through the [[GIUK gap|gap]] between the [[Faroe Islands|Faroe]] and [[Shetland Islands]]. Her first victim was ''Erodona'' which she damaged south of [[Iceland]] on 16 March. She also damaged ''Siremalm'' on the 23rd. This ship only escaped after she was hit by a [[torpedo]] which failed to detonate, (although it left a large dent) and the U-boat's 105mm [[deck gun]] crew forgot to remove the [[tampion]] in the muzzle before engaging their target. The resulting explosion on firing the first round wounded three men and compelled the boat to fire on the merchantman with the smaller 37 and 20 mm armament. Despite being hit, ''Siremalm'' successfully fled the scene, zig-zagging as she went.\n\n''U-110'' arrived in Lorient on the French Atlantic coast on 29 March, having cut the patrol short due to damage from the exploding gun.\n\n===Second patrol and capture===\nThe boat departed Lorient on 15 April 1941. On the 27th, she sank ''Henri Mory'' about {{convert|330|nmi}} west northwest of [[Blasket Islands]], Ireland.\n\nHer next quarry were the ships of [[convoy OB 318]] east of [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]] (Greenland). She successfully attacked and sank ''Esmond'' and ''Bengore Head'', but the escort vessels responded. The British corvette, {{HMS|Aubrietia|K96|6}}, located the U-boat with [[ASDIC]] (sonar). ''Aubrietia'' and British destroyer {{HMS|Broadway|H90|2}} then proceeded to drop [[depth charge]]s, forcing ''U-110'' to surface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-110A/U-110GreenockReportU-110.htm|title=U-boat Archive – U-110 – Greenock Report – Attacks on U-110|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Operation ''Primrose'' (9 May 1941)===\n\n''U-110'' survived the attack, but was seriously damaged. {{HMS|Bulldog|H91|6}} and ''Broadway'' remained in contact after ''Aubrietia''{{'}}s last attack. ''Broadway'' shaped course to ram, but fired two depth charges beneath the U-boat instead, in an endeavour to make the crew abandon ship before scuttling her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uboatarchive.net/U-110A/U-110GreenockReport.htm|title=U-boat Archive – U-110 – Greenock Report – Attacks on U-110|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref> Lemp announced \"Last stop, everybody out\", meaning \"Abandon ship\". As the crew turned out onto the U-boat's deck they came under fire from ''Bulldog'' and ''Broadway'' with casualties from gunfire and drowning. The British had believed that the German deck gun was to be used and ceased fire when they realised that the U-boat was being abandoned and the crew wanted to surrender.\n\nLemp realised that ''U-110'' was not sinking and attempted to swim back to it to destroy the secret material, and was never seen again. A German eyewitness testified that he was shot in the water by a British sailor, but his fate is not confirmed. Including Lemp, 15 men were killed in the action, and 32 were captured. Radio Officer Georg Högel and the rest of the crew were held at ''Camp 23'' ([[Monteith POW camp]] at [[Iroquois Falls, Northern Ontario]], Canada), which is now the [[Monteith Correctional Complex]].\n\n''Bulldog''{{'}}s [[boarding (attack)|boarding]] party, led by Sub-Lieutenant David Balme, got onto ''U-110'' and stripped it of everything portable, including her [[Kurzsignale]] code book and [[Enigma machine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/774427.stm|title=Capturing the real ''U-571'', BBC|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref> William Stewart Pollock, a former radio operator in the Royal Navy and on loan to ''Bulldog'', was on the second boat to board ''U-110''. He retrieved the Enigma machine and books as they looked out of place in the radio room. ''U-110'' was taken in tow back toward Britain, but sank en route to [[Iceland]].\n\nThe documents captured from ''U-110'' helped [[Bletchley Park]] codebreakers solve ''[[Reservehandverfahren]]'', a reserve German hand cipher.<!-- and more...-->\n\n==Wolfpacks==\n''U-110'' took part in one [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]], namely:\n* [[Wolfpack West|West]] (9 May 1941)\n\n==Modern-day connections==\nThe 2000 film ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'' was partially inspired by the capture of ''U-110''.\n\nIn 2007, the submarine's chronometer was featured on the BBC programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'', from [[Alnwick Castle]], in the possession of the grandson of the captain of the ship which captured her.\n\n==Summary of raiding history==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!Date !!

Her keel was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 1 August 1935, by [[Germaniawerft]] of [[Kiel]] as yard number 550. She was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 February 1936. During [[World War II]], she conducted operations against enemy shipping.\n\n''U-20'' went on 16 war patrols, sinking 13 ships totalling {{GRT|30,058}} and 9 tons , damaging one more of {{GRT|1,846|link=off}}.\n\n==Design==\n[[German Type IIB submarine]]s were enlarged versions of the original [[German Type IIA submarine|Type II]]s. ''U-20'' had a displacement of {{convert|279|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|328|t|LT}} while submerged. Officially, the standard tonnage was {{convert|250|LT|t|abbr=on}}, however.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=39–40}} The U-boat had a total length of {{convert|42.70|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[pressure hull]] length of {{convert|28.20|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|4.08|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a height of {{convert|8.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|3.90|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The submarine was powered by two [[MWM GmbH|MWM]] RS 127 S four-stroke, six-cylinder [[diesel engine]]s of {{convert|700|PS|kW shp|-1}} for cruising, two [[Siemens-Schuckert]] PG VV 322/36 [[Motor–generator|double-acting electric motors]] producing a total of {{convert|460|PS|kW shp|-1}} for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two {{convert|0.85|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[propeller]]s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to {{convert|80|-|150|m}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=39–40}}\n\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|12|kn}} and a maximum submerged speed of {{convert|7|kn}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=39–40}} When submerged, the boat could operate for {{convert|35|-|42|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|3800|nmi}} at {{convert|8|kn}}. ''U-20'' was fitted with three {{convert|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s at the bow, five [[torpedo]]es or up to twelve Type A torpedo mines, and a [[2 cm Flak 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} anti-aircraft gun]]. The boat had a [[Ship's company|complement]] of twentyfive.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=39–40}}\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===First, second and third patrols===\n''U-20''{{'}}s first three patrols involved observation (in August 1939) and the laying of [[Naval mine|mine]]s in the [[North Sea]] and off the British east coast. She would start in [[Kiel]] and finish in [[Wilhelmshaven]]; then reverse the process.\n\n===Fourth and fifth patrols===\nShe sank ''Magnus'' about {{convert|40|nmi|abbr=on}} east northeast of [[Peterhead]] in Scotland. The ship went down in 90 seconds; there was only one survivor. She also sank ''Ionian'' and ''Willowpool'' in November and December respectively, with mines laid in November.\n\nThe boat sank ''Sylvia'' northeast of [[Aberdeen]] on her fifth sortie on 13 October 1940.\n\n===Sixth to eighth patrols===\n''U-20'' sank a steady number of ships on her sixth and seventh patrols, (her eighth foray was relatively quiet), but a series of changes were on the way.\n\nShe was transferred to the ''U-Ausbildungsflottille'' as a school boat on 1 May 1940, then the [[Black Sea]], avoiding the heavy British presence at [[Gibraltar]] and throughout the Mediterranean by being transported in sections along the Danube to the Romanian port of [[Galați]]. She was then re-assembled by the Romanians at the [[Galați shipyard]] and sent to her new home in the [[Black Sea]] so she could serve with the [[30th U-boat Flotilla]].<ref>Steel and Ice: The U-boat Battle in the Arctic and Black Sea 1941-45, Chapter 5 - The Black Sea: War in the South 1942-43, fifth page</ref>\n\n===Ninth and tenth patrols===\nThe boat's first patrol in the new environment, but her ninth overall, almost ended in disaster when she tried to [[torpedo]] a Soviet submarine chaser; the vessel responded by dropping eight [[depth charge]]s. ''U-20'' was obliged to stay submerged for four hours and returned to base with various mechanical failures.\n\nNear the end of sally number ten, a crew member from {{GS|U-19|1936|2}} who had been taken sick, was transferred to ''U-20'' on 4 August 1943. The boat docked at Constanta on the seventh.\n\n===11th to 14th patrols===\nThese patrols were conducted between Constanta and [[Sevastopol]]. ''U-20'' sank the Soviet ''Vaijan Kutur'e'' on 16 January 1944 off [[Cape Anakria]].\n\n===15th patrol===\nThe boat sank ''Pestel'' on 19 June 1944 off [[Trabzon]]. The Soviets reported that this ship was sunk in Turkish territorial waters.\n\nShe also sank the Soviet landing craft ''DB-26'' on 26 June with gunfire and demolition charges.\n\n===16th patrol and fate===\nShe was scuttled on 10 September 1944, in the Black Sea off the coast of Turkey.{{sfn|Kemp|1999|p=217}}\n\nOn 3 February 2008, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper reported that ''U-20'' had been discovered by Selçuk Kolay, a Turkish marine engineer, in {{convert|80|ft}} of water off the coast of the Turkish city of [[Karasu, Sakarya|Karasu]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1577456/Adolf-Hitlers-lost-fleet-found-in-Black-Sea.html Adolf Hitler's \"Lost fleet\" found in Black Sea], ''The Daily Telegraph'', retrieved 2010-12-27</ref>\n\n==Summary of raiding history==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
